"How lonely sits the city That was full of people! How like a widow is she, Who was great among the nations! The princess among the provinces Has become a slave!","Ơu, pơlei tih âu sơ̆ đei lơ kon pơlei dêh, to dang ei ngôi hơdrô̆! Sơ̆ pơm tih kơ lu kon pơlei, 'nâu dang ei thoi yă adro! Sơ̆ lu drŏ-kăn jing yŏng tơ'ngla kơ lu tơring, dang ei jing đĭch đam!"
"She weeps bitterly in the night, Her tears are on her cheeks; Among all her lovers She has none to comfort her. All her friends have dealt treacherously with her; They have become her enemies.","Sư nhơ̆m ơh ol kơmăng, đak măt lĕch 'bĕnh kơ tơ'bŏk. Dôm lu bơngai mă 'mêm kơ sư, ưh kơ đei bu pơlung sư. Buôl buăl sư pơm tơwih kơ sư, tă kơ jing ayăt ngăl."
"Judah has gone into captivity, Under affliction and hard servitude; She dwells among the nations, She finds no rest; All her persecutors overtake her in dire straits.","Juđa năm pơm bơnă, chu iŏk pơmat kư̆m chu đe wơh pơđep. Chă oei sa tơ kon pơlei ưh pă đei pơdơh ngôi. Lu bơngai mă pơm kơnê̆ druh sư, tam tơ anih kueng."
"The roads to Zion mourn Because no one comes to the set feasts. All her gates are desolate; Her priests sigh, Her virgins are afflicted, And she is in bitterness.","Lu trong năm tơ pơlei Siôn bơsĕl, yua kơ ưh kơ đei bu năm ngôi lăm năr giĕng tih. Rim 'măng jang đĭ juơ; lu 'bok soi tơtok tơtăm; Lu adruh hle pơmat-tat, lu sư bơih wă pŭ iŏk pơmat-tat dêh."
"Her adversaries have become the master, Her enemies prosper; For the LORD has afflicted her Because of the multitude of her transgressions. Her children have gone into captivity before the enemy.","Bơngai ayăt kơ sư jing yŏng, bơngai blah sư jing pŭn hiôk; Yua kơ 'Bok Kei-Dei pơmat sư, yua kơ tơdrong yoch sư lơ dêh. Lu kon hơ'lơ̆p sư lu ayăt rôp pơm bơnă."
"And from the daughter of Zion All her splendor has departed. Her princes have become like deer That find no pasture, That flee without strength Before the pursuer.","Kon adruh Siôn hiong đĭ boih dôm tơdrong mă đe ư-ang. Lu kră pơgơ̆r nhen thoi juei chă tơmăn 'nhĕt sa pă đei, Kơdâu pă kĕ đĭ jơhngơ̆m 'bơ̆t anăp lu bơngai druh sư."
"In the days of her affliction and roaming, Jerusalem remembers all her pleasant things That she had in the days of old. When her people fell into the hand of the enemy, With no one to help her, The adversaries saw her And mocked at her downfall.","Lăm năr pơmat-tat, Jêrusalem 'blŏk kơ đêl sư chơt hiôk; Kơplah kon pơlei sư huŏng lăm ti lu ayăt ưh pă đei bu năm dŏng sư dơ̆ng. Khŭl linh ayăt 'bôh sư thoi noh, na hiĕk ăr kơ sư yua kơ đĭ juơ juŏ!"
"Jerusalem has sinned gravely, Therefore she has become vile. All who honored her despise her Because they have seen her nakedness; Yes, she sighs and turns away.","Jêrusalem pơm yoch tih, yua kơ 'noh na mă jing kơnê̆ 'mê̆ brư̆. Dôm lu bơngai mă juăt kơ pơyom kơ sư dang ei pă đei boih, Yua kơ 'bôh sư hang-hông. Kơdih kâu lu sư tơtok, na kơdŭn tơ rŏng."
"Her uncleanness is in her skirts; She did not consider her destiny; Therefore her collapse was awesome; She had no comforter. “O LORD, behold my affliction, For the enemy is exalted!”","Hơbĕn ao lu sư mơgrĭ; sư ưh pă đei tơchĕng boih năr tôch wă truh kơ sư!

"The adversary has spread his hand Over all her pleasant things; For she has seen the nations enter her sanctuary, Those whom You commanded Not to enter Your assembly.","Lu bơngai ayăt yơ̆r ti boih wă iŏk dôm tơmam 'lơ̆ng sư; Yua kơ lu sư 'bôh boih lu kon pơlei tơmoi năm mơ̆t lăm anih rơgoh sư. Lu kon pơlei tơmoi noh Kră Yang đei khan: Ưh kơ gơh kơ mơ̆t ôh lăm khŭl sư"
"All her people sigh, They seek bread; They have given their valuables for food to restore life. “See, O LORD, and consider, For I am scorned.”","Đĭ kon pơlei chă tơmam sa păng tơtok rah; Tơplih đĭ tơdrong chơt hiôk iŏk tơmam sa, wă kơ chhơp hiôk lăm jơhngơ̆m sư kơdih. Ơ Kră Yang, apinh Ih 'blŏk kơ inh, yua kơ inh jing bơngai pă rơ-a boih"
"“Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by? Behold and see If there is any sorrow like my sorrow, Which has been brought on me, Which the LORD has inflicted In the day of His fierce anger.","Ơ lu bơngai chă yak drong găn, bơ̆n hăm pă tơ'bưh hah?

"“From above He has sent fire into my bones, And it overpowered them; He has spread a net for my feet And turned me back; He has made me desolate And faint all the day.","Sư đei tơjur boih ŭnh đơ̆ng kơpal, mơ̆t lăm tơring inh na kĕ jei. Sư đei dăng boih hơnhuăl ala jơ̆ng inh, pơm kơ inh kơdŭn tơ rŏng. Sư đei pơm boih kơ inh rơdu rơmơ̆n, rim năr rai hiong hiach."
"“The yoke of my transgressions was bound; They were woven together by His hands, And thrust upon my neck. He made my strength fail; The Lord delivered me into the hands of those whom I am not able to withstand.","'Long ăt tơdrong yoch Sư chô̆ ti inh. Sư dan đĭ hơchô̆ trăp dêh, Sư pơm ăn tơdrong pran kơtang inh hiong đĭ. Kră Yang jao lăm ti lu sư boih, na inh pă kĕ blah dơ̆ng."
"“The Lord has trampled underfoot all my mighty men in my midst; He has called an assembly against me To crush my young men; The Lord trampled as in a winepress The virgin daughter of Judah.","Lu linh pran kơtang inh, Kră Yang pơrăm lê̆ đĭ boih. Sư akŭm pơpôi lu linh wă pơm kơnê̆ kơ inh, wă pơjuă pơhĕch lê̆ lu kon tơdăm inh, Kră Yang pơjuă gơhlơ̆r lê̆ lu kon adruh Juđa thoi gơ'bang đe hmĕt plei hơmu."
"“For these things I weep; My eye, my eye overflows with water; Because the comforter, who should restore my life, Is far from me. My children are desolate Because the enemy prevailed.”","Yua kơ thoi noh boih inh nhơ̆m hmoi, na đak măt inh lĕch lơ. Yua kơ lu bơngai râu pơlung jơhngơ̆m inh đĭ ataih boih. Kon sâu inh pơmat-tat, yua kơ jei lu ayăt boih."
"Zion spreads out her hands, But no one comforts her; The LORD has commanded concerning Jacob That those around him become his adversaries; Jerusalem has become an unclean thing among them.","Siôn yơ̆r ti, mă-lei ưh kơ đei bu pơlung sư; Kră Yang đei roi boih gah Jakôp; Đei lu bơngai cheng sư pơm kơnê̆ hăm sư. Jêrusalem mă lu sư oei noh jing 'mê̆-'mach."
"“The LORD is righteous, For I rebelled against His commandment. Hear now, all peoples, And behold my sorrow; My virgins and my young men Have gone into captivity.","Kră Yang jơ̆ tơpăt, yua kơ inh đei pơjah boih hăm nơ̆r Sư. Apinh iĕm mơ̆ng, ơ đĭ-đăng kon pơlei, lăng bĕ tơdrong inh blĕk! Kon adruh păng kon tơdăm inh jing bơnă đe boih."
"“I called for my lovers, But they deceived me; My priests and my elders Breathed their last in the city, While they sought food To restore their life.","Inh krao pơtơm boih lu bơngai mă 'mêm kơ inh, mă-lei lu sư hơlĕnh kơ inh.

"“See, O LORD, that I am in distress; My soul is troubled; My heart is overturned within me, For I have been very rebellious. Outside the sword bereaves, At home it is like death.","Ơ Kră Yang, lăng bĕ, yua kơ inh tơ'bơ̆p tơdrong gleh truh, Jơhngơ̆m inh chhŭr nuih, plei nuih inh pơpơ̆, Yua kơ inh pơm kơnê̆ dêh. Tơ 'nguaih đei đao gưm pơrăm đe, Tơ lăm hnam đei tơdrong lôch."
"“They have heard that I sigh, But no one comforts me. All my enemies have heard of my trouble; They are glad that You have done it. Bring on the day You have announced, That they may become like me.","Đe kơtơ̆ng nơ̆r inh ôr krao. Mă-lei ưh kơ đei năm pơlung.

"“Let all their wickedness come before You, And do to them as You have done to me For all my transgressions; For my sighs are many, And my heart is faint.”","Ăn kơ tơdrong yoch lu sư gô pơdah 'bơ̆t anăp Ih!

"How the Lord has covered the daughter of Zion With a cloud in His anger! He cast down from heaven to the earth The beauty of Israel, And did not remember His footstool In the day of His anger.","Yua kơ kiơ Ih hil thoi hơmơ̆l gom kon adruh Siôn? Sư klơ̆m hŭt lê̆ tơdrong ư-ang Isơrael đơ̆ng plĕnh tơ teh. Lăm năr Sư hil, Sư ưh pă đei 'blŏk boih 'long đêl Sư hơgơn jơ̆ng."
"The Lord has swallowed up and has not pitied All the dwelling places of Jacob. He has thrown down in His wrath The strongholds of the daughter of Judah; He has brought them down to the ground; He has profaned the kingdom and its princes.","Kră Yang pơrăm boih, ưh pă đei mơnat, đĭ-đăng anih Jakôp oei.

"He has cut off in fierce anger Every horn of Israel; He has drawn back His right hand From before the enemy. He has blazed against Jacob like a flaming fire Devouring all around.","Lăm năr Sư hil, Sư ret đĭ hơke Isơrael Sư dui lê̆ ti 'ma Sư boih 'bơ̆t anăp lu ayăt."
"Standing like an enemy, He has bent His bow; With His right hand, like an adversary, He has slain all who were pleasing to His eye; On the tent of the daughter of Zion, He has poured out His fury like fire.","Sư gŭt hră thoi lu ayăt, yơ̆r ti 'ma Sư pơm thoi lu bơngai wă blah; Sư pơlôch boih dôm bơngai pơhiôk kơ măt, Lăm anih kon adruh Siôn, Sư tuh tơdrong hil thoi ŭnh."
"The Lord was like an enemy. He has swallowed up Israel, He has swallowed up all her palaces; He has destroyed her strongholds, And has increased mourning and lamentation In the daughter of Judah.","Kră Yang jing thoi bơngai ayăt, pơrăm boih Isơrael. Pơrăm đĭ hnam pơtao, pơrăm đĭ kơđông pơm ăn kơ kon adruh Juđa ơh sơ'ngon nhơ̆m hmoi."
"He has done violence to His tabernacle, As if it were a garden; He has destroyed His place of assembly; The LORD has caused The appointed feasts and Sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion. In His burning indignation He has spurned the king and the priest.","Sư hơ'nglơh lê̆ pơk sư, thoi pơk lăm pơgar, Kŭm đei pơrăm anih lu sư juăt kơ akŭm. Tơ Siôn, Kră Yang pơm ăn kơ lu sư hiơt đĭ kơ năr akŭm tih păng năr Sa'bat."
"The Lord has spurned His altar, He has abandoned His sanctuary; He has given up the walls of her palaces Into the hand of the enemy. They have made a noise in the house of the LORD As on the day of a set feast.","Kră Yang hŭt lê̆ boih gơ'bang soi păng kư̆m achăng lê̆ anih rơgoh Sư. Sư jao boih hnam pơtao kơ lu ayăt, Lu sư ôr tơkĕch tơjrông tơjrang lăm hnam Kră Yang, Thoi năr đe et sa tih."
"The LORD has purposed to destroy The wall of the daughter of Zion. He has stretched out a line; He has not withdrawn His hand from destroying; Therefore He has caused the rampart and wall to lament; They languished together.","Kră Yang đei pơkă wă pơrăm dur kon adruh Siôn, Sư dăng boih tơlei hơgăt, Sư ưh tam mă đei layơ pơdơh ti pơrăm đe noh, Sư pơm dur wă pĕng păng dur pơlei nhơ̆m hmoi."
"Her gates have sunk into the ground; He has destroyed and broken her bars. Her king and her princes are among the nations; The Law is no more, And her prophets find no vision from the LORD.","Lu 'măng jang tơkơ̆l đĭ tơ teh păng gơ̆ lê̆ chơkăl sư; Pơtao hăm lu kră pơlei oei hơdai hăm lu kon pơlei, Jing anih ưh pă đei khôi juăt!

"The elders of the daughter of Zion Sit on the ground and keep silence; They throw dust on their heads And gird themselves with sackcloth. The virgins of Jerusalem Bow their heads to the ground.","Lu Kră lu kon adruh Siôn tơoei tơ teh ưh pă đei pơma kiơ.

"My eyes fail with tears, My heart is troubled; My bile is poured on the ground Because of the destruction of the daughter of my people, Because the children and the infants Faint in the streets of the city.","Măt inh đĭ hrŏ yua kơ đak măt lĕch, jơhngơ̆m inh rŭng răng.

"They say to their mothers, “Where is grain and wine?” As they swoon like the wounded In the streets of the city, As their life is poured out In their mothers’ bosom.","Lu sư chă khan hăm mĕ lu sư thoi âu: Chă tơmam sa păng sik hơmu tơ yơ?

"How shall I console you? To what shall I liken you, O daughter of Jerusalem? What shall I compare with you, that I may comfort you, O virgin daughter of Zion? For your ruin is spread wide as the sea; Who can heal you?","Liơ inh gơh pơting hăm iĕm, Wă kơ gơh pơlung iĕm; Ơ kon adruh pơlei Siôn? Yua kơ rơka lu iĕm jrŭ thoi đak dơsĭ. Bu wă gơh ming klaih?"
"Your prophets have seen for you False and deceptive visions; They have not uncovered your iniquity, To bring back your captives, But have envisioned for you false prophecies and delusions.","Lu bơngai khan lê̆ adrol iĕm 'bôh boih tơdrong hơlĕnh păng chă pơhlŭ iĕm.

"All who pass by clap their hands at you; They hiss and shake their heads At the daughter of Jerusalem: “Is this the city that is called ‘The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth’?”","Lu bơngai yak rok trong 'bôh iĕm lu sư tap ti, Hiĕk ăr tơtreh kơ̆l, Yua kơ 'bôh kon adruh Jêrusalem, Hăm trŏ kơ 'nâu pơlei tih mă đe khan pơlei tih pơlei 'lơ̆ng rŏ, đei chơt hiôk kơjăp kơ teh đak?"
"All your enemies have opened their mouth against you; They hiss and gnash their teeth. They say, “We have swallowed her up! Surely this is the day we have waited for; We have found it, we have seen it!”","Dôm lu ayăt kơ iĕm ha 'bơ̆r khan kơ iĕm, Hiĕk achơ̆, kăp hơnĕnh, thoi âu: Lu bơ̆n luăn lê̆ sư boih!

"The LORD has done what He purposed; He has fulfilled His word Which He commanded in days of old. He has thrown down and has not pitied, And He has caused an enemy to rejoice over you; He has exalted the horn of your adversaries.","Kră Yang pơm boih dôm đêl sư pơkă, Pơm keh boih mă sư kơdih đei khan lê̆; thoi sư đei pơkă lê̆ đunh boih.

"Their heart cried out to the Lord, “O wall of the daughter of Zion, Let tears run down like a river day and night; Give yourself no relief; Give your eyes no rest.","Jơhngơ̆m kon pơlei ih ôr krao truh tơ Kră Yang, Ơ dur pơlei kon adruh Siôn, Ăn bĕ đak măt iĕm ro thoi đak glung.

"“Arise, cry out in the night, At the beginning of the watches; Pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord. Lift your hands toward Him For the life of your young children, Who faint from hunger at the head of every street.”","Iung ôr krao bĕ kơmăng, thoi đe pơtơm gak kơmăng.

"“See, O LORD, and consider! To whom have You done this? Should the women eat their offspring, The children they have cuddled? Should the priest and prophet be slain In the sanctuary of the Lord?","Ơ Kră Yang, apinh Ih lăng lăng! Ih tam đei pơm kơ bu thoi noh?
