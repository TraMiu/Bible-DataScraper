"In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.","Sơnăm mă pêng lăm chăl Jêhôiakim, pơtao đe Juđa, na Nebukatnessar, pơtao Babilôn, năm truh tơ pơlei tih Jêrusalem wang wă blah iŏk."
"And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with some of the articles of the house of God, which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the articles into the treasure house of his god.","Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei jao Jêhôiakim, pơtao đe Juđa păng đei tơmam đơ̆ng hnam Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lăm ti Nebukatnessar. Sư anhăk ba tơmam noh brŏk tơ dêh Babilôn, tơmơ̆t lăm rông yang sư păng 'măn lê̆ tơ lăm hnam mong tơmam ăn kơ yang sư kơdih."
"Then the king instructed Ashpenaz, the master of his eunuchs, to bring some of the children of Israel and some of the king’s descendants and some of the nobles","Pơtao pơkă kơ Aspenas, bơngai mă pơgơ̆r tơm lu linh krĕo, chă rơih iŏk lăm lu kon sâu Isơrael, lăm adrĕch pơtao păng lăm lu jang tih."
"young men in whom there was no blemish, but good-looking, gifted in all wisdom, possessing knowledge and quick to understand, who had ability to serve in the king’s palace, and whom they might teach the language and literature of the Chaldeans.","Năm ba lu hơ'lơ̆p drŏ-nglo 'lơ̆ng huay kơ đei jĭ jăn, muh măt 'lơ̆ng hơbŏ, đei dôm tơdrong gơh hơgei, gơh tơchĕng hlôh wao, gơh băt dôm tơdrong, gơh jang tơ lăm anih hnam pơtao, bơtho kơ lu sư tơdrong gơh hơgei păng nơ̆r pơma bơngai Kalđê."
"And the king appointed for them a daily provision of the king’s delicacies and of the wine which he drank, and three years of training for them, so that at the end of that time they might serve before the king.","Pơtao khan wă ăn kơ lu bơngai noh sŏng sa rim năr tơmam sŏng sa 'băt 'lơ̆ng mă pơtao sa păng tơdrô mă đơ̆ng pơtao huch, wă rong păng bơtho lu sư thoi noh lăm pêng sơnăm, na lu sư gô awih awăn 'bơ̆t anăp pơtao."
"Now from among those of the sons of Judah were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.","Lăm lu buăl noh đei Đaniel, Hanania, Mêsael păng Asaria adrĕch adrung bơngai Juđa."
"To them the chief of the eunuchs gave names: he gave Daniel the name Belteshazzar; to Hananiah, Shadrach; to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abed-Nego.","Bơngai yŏng pơgơ̆r linh krĕo krao ming anăn lu sư; Đaniel sư krao Beltơsatsar, Hanania sư krao Sadrak; Mêsael sư krao Mêsak; păng Asaria krao sư Abetnigo."
"But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s delicacies, nor with the wine which he drank; therefore he requested of the chief of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.","'Nâu, Đaniel pơkă lăm jơhngơ̆m sư khan, ưh kơ wă sŏng sa tơmam 'lơ̆ng păng tơdrô pơtao soi kơ yang jing pơm kơ inh kơnê̆, na apinh bơngai wei-lăng 'nĕ pơgŏ sư pơm yoch kơnê̆ noh."
"Now God had brought Daniel into the favor and goodwill of the chief of the eunuchs.","Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei pơm ăn bơngai wei-lăng linh krĕo gơh mơnat ăn kơ Đaniel."
"And the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, “I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your food and drink. For why should he see your faces looking worse than the young men who are your age? Then you would endanger my head before the king.”","Bơngai yŏng linh krĕo âu khan kơ Đaniel thoi âu: Inh hli kơ pơtao yŏng tơ'ngla inh, đei pơkă athei ăn kơ lu iĕm tơmam sa păng tơdrô huch, na kơnh pơtao 'bôh muh măt iĕm hơkĕ hloh kơ buăl 'lơ̆p nai, mă sơnăm 'lơ̆p 'lŏ iĕm hơdai, na lu iĕm gô năm ba kơ pơtao kăt hơko inh hă?"
"So Daniel said to the steward whom the chief of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah","Đaniel khan kơ Hamensa bơngai wei-lăng linh krĕo mă kư̆m wei rong lu đe Đaniel, Hanania, Mêsael, Asaria thoi âu"
"“Please test your servants for ten days, and let them give us vegetables to eat and water to drink.","Inh apinh ih pơlong lăng đĭch đam ih âu lăm mơjĭt năr, ăn kơ lu nhôn sŏng sa 'nhot. Păng nhă đak 'blăng hmă đĕch."
"Then let our appearance be examined before you, and the appearance of the young men who eat the portion of the king’s delicacies; and as you see fit, so deal with your servants.”","Đơ̆ng rŏng ih gô pơting lăng muh măt lu nhôn hăm lu hơ'lơ̆p mă sŏng sa huch tơdrô, tơmam 'lơ̆ng đơ̆ng 'bok pơtao; đơ̆ng noh ih gô pơm, thoi nơ̆r ih đei pơma kơ lu đĭch đam ih."
"So he consented with them in this matter, and tested them ten days.","Hamensa chu kiơ̆ nơ̆r lu sư apinh păng pơlong lăng lu sư lăm mơjĭt năr."
"And at the end of ten days their features appeared better and fatter in flesh than all the young men who ate the portion of the king’s delicacies.","Tôm mơjĭt năr boih, lăng muh măt lu sư oei bek 'lơ̆ng hloh kơ lu hơ'lơ̆p nai mă đei sŏng sa tơmam sa 'lơ̆ng đơ̆ng pơtao."
"Thus the steward took away their portion of delicacies and the wine that they were to drink, and gave them vegetables.","Thoi noh, Hamensa ming lê̆ tơmam sa 'lơ̆ng păng tơdrô đơ̆ng ăn kơ lu sư sa ră păng ăn kơ lu sư sa 'nhot."
"As for these four young men, God gave them knowledge and skill in all literature and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.","Đơ̆ng noh, Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ăn kơ puăn 'nu bơngai tơdăm noh đei kơ̆l 'ngok gơh hơgei lăm rim tơdrong lu sư hŏk pơhrăm. Đaniel kư̆m đei gơh băt tơblang tơdrong tơ'bôh păng tơdrong apo."
"Now at the end of the days, when the king had said that they should be brought in, the chief of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.","Dĭng truh tơ pơtao pơkă wă tơ'bơ̆p lu sư, na yŏng linh krĕo ba lu sư truh tơ anăp pơtao Nebukatnessar."
"Then the king interviewed them, and among them all none was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; therefore they served before the king.","Pơtao pơma dơnuh păng lu sư păng lăm đĭ-đăng lu sư, đe bu gơh hơgei dang Đaniel, Hanania, Mêsael păng Asaria; Na lu sư gơh dơ̆ng bơ̆jang 'bơ̆t anăp pơtao."
"And in all matters of wisdom and understanding about which the king examined them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers who were in all his realm.","Na pơtao apinh lu sư tôm tơdrong gah tơdrong gơh hơgei, na 'bôh lu sư gơh hơgei hloh kơ bơngai păng bơngai tơwir lăm jơ̆p kơ dêh char sư mơjĭt wơ̆t 'mơ̆i."
"Thus Daniel continued until the first year of King Cyrus.","Thoi ei, Đaniel oei hloi tơ noh dĭng truh tơ sơnăm blŭng-a lăm chăl pơtao Sirus."
"Now in the second year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; and his spirit was so troubled that his sleep left him.","Lăm sơnăm mă 'bar lăm chăl pơtao Nebukatnessar, pơtao đei apo 'bôh, na lăm jơhngơ̆m ưh kơsŭk dĭng mah pă đei tep."
"Then the king gave the command to call the magicians, the astrologers, the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans to tell the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.","Thoi noh, na pơtao krao lu bơngai hơgei, lu pơjâu, lu bơngai Kalđê wă athei tơblang tơdrong pơtao đei apo 'bôh. Lu sư năm đĭ 'bơ̆t anăp 'Bok pơtao."
"And the king said to them, “I have had a dream, and my spirit is anxious to know the dream.”","Pơtao khan kơ lu sư thoi âu: Inh đei apo 'bôh minh tơdrong; Na jơhngơ̆m inh ưh kơsŭk, wă kơ băt tơdrong inh apo noh, wă khan thoi yơ."
"Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic, “O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will give the interpretation.”","Mă-lei lu bơngai Kalđê pơma hăm pơtao hăm nơ̆r Aram thoi âu: Kơkuh kơ ih pơtao hơpơi ăn kơ ih arih sot! Apinh ih roi bĕ tơdrong apo noh kơ lu đĭch đam ih păng lu nhôn gô tơblang."
"The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, “My decision is firm: if you do not make known the dream to me, and its interpretation, you shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made an ash heap.","Pơtao tơl lu bơngai noh thoi âu: Tơdrong noh lĕch hlôi đơ̆ng inh boih. Tơdah lu iĕm ưh kơ roi kơ inh băt tơdrong apo noh thoi yơ păng tơblang liơ, lei lu iĕm gô lôch sơ̆k akâu, hnam lu iĕm đe kư̆m gô pơrăm đĭ truh tơ hơnă."
"However, if you tell the dream and its interpretation, you shall receive from me gifts, rewards, and great honor. Therefore tell me the dream and its interpretation.”","Mă-lei tơdah iĕm gơh tơblang tơdrong apo noh kơ inh, lei iĕm gô đei tơmam apah tih păng gô pôk pơang iĕm lăm anih ư-ang inh, lu iĕm athei tơblang ăn kơ inh tơdrong apo noh păng wă khan liơ."
"They answered again and said, “Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will give its interpretation.”","Lu sư wơ̆t apinh mă 'bar dơ̆ng thoi âu: Apinh pơtao roi ăn kơ lu nhôn đĭch đam ih păng lu nhôn gô tơblang."
"The king answered and said, “I know for certain that you would gain time, because you see that my decision is firm","Pơtao khan: Inh băt lu iĕm chă đon wă pơhiơ̆, yua kơ lu iĕm băt boih tơdrong noh inh hiơt đĭ boih."
"if you do not make known the dream to me, there is only one decree for you! For you have agreed to speak lying and corrupt words before me till the time has changed. Therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can give me its interpretation.”","Mă-lei tơdah lu iĕm ưh kơ gơh tơblang tơdrong apo noh kơ inh, na kư̆m lăp minh tơdrong pơm ăn kơ lu iĕm; yua kơ lu iĕm đei pơđâu băl boih hăm tơdrong hơlĕnh păng pơma kư̆ kă kơ inh, chang hơmĕng gô đei năr tơplih. Thoi noh, tơbăt bĕ tơdrong apo noh, wă kơ inh băt iĕm gơh tơblang trŏ dah ưh."
"The Chaldeans answered the king, and said, “There is not a man on earth who can tell the king’s matter; therefore no king, lord, or ruler has ever asked such things of any magician, astrologer, or Chaldean.","Lu bơngai Kalđê khan dơ̆ng kơ pơtao thoi âu: Ưh kơ đei minh 'nu bơngai bu ala teh âu gơh tơblang ăn tơdrong ih apo noh; yua kơ ưh kơ đei pơtao ayơ păng yŏng mơng pơgơ̆r ayơ mă pơtă tơdrong thoi noh kơ lu bơngai pơjâu lăng sơnglŏng dah lu bơngai Kalđê tơblang."
"It is a difficult thing that the king requests, and there is no other who can tell it to the king except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.”","Yua kơ tơdrong pơtao wă apinh noh khăi dêh păng ưh kơ đei bu gơh băt gơh tơblang tơdrong apo noh kơ 'bok pơtao, hli kơ lu yang đĕch gơh, yang mă ưh kơ oei arih hăm sĕch akar âu."
"For this reason the king was angry and very furious, and gave the command to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.","Thoi noh na pơtao blĕk hil dêh, na athei đe rôp pơlôch đĭ lu bơngai hơgei lăm char Babilôn."
"So the decree went out, and they began killing the wise men; and they sought Daniel and his companions, to kill them.","Thoi noh na nơ̆r noh kư̆m athei lu bơngai jang kơ pơtao wă năm pơlôch lu bơngai hơgei, na kư̆m wă chă Đaniel hăm lu buăl sư hai wă pơlôch."
"Then with counsel and wisdom Daniel answered Arioch, the captain of the king’s guard, who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon","Kơplah jơ noh Đaniel kiơ̆ kơ tơdrong gơh hơgei hlôh wao sư na khan kơ Ariok. Bơngai wei-lăng pơtao, bơngai mă năm wă pơlôch lu bơngai hơgei lăm char Babilôn."
"he answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain, “Why is the decree from the king so urgent?” Then Arioch made the decision known to Daniel.","Đaniel khan kơ Ariok yŏng linh wei pơtao thoi âu: Yua kơ kiơ mă đei tơdrong hăt hot dêh đơ̆ng pơtao thoi noh? Ariok roi ăn kơ Đaniel băt hơđăl."
"So Daniel went in and asked the king to give him time, that he might tell the king the interpretation.","Đaniel năm mơ̆t hloi, apinh pơtao ăn kơ sư hơya minh 'bar năr dơ̆ng wă kơ gơh tơblang tơdrong pơtao apo noh."
"Then Daniel went to his house, and made the decision known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions","Đơ̆ng noh, Đaniel brŏk tơ hnam păng roi dôm tơdrong noh kơ buăl sư Hanania, Misael păng Asaria."
"that they might seek mercies from the God of heaven concerning this secret, so that Daniel and his companions might not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.","Sư apinh buăl sư krao khan hơpơi kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei mơnat kơ lu sư tơ'bôh ăn tơdrong hlơp noh, wă kơ Đaniel hăm lu buăl sư huay kơ đe pơlôch, hơdai hăm lu bơngai hơgei đe Babilôn."
"Then the secret was revealed to Daniel in a night vision. So Daniel blessed the God of heaven.","Thoi noh tơdrong hlơp noh tơ'bôh ăn kơ Đaniel 'bôh kơmăng; Đaniel bơnê kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei kơpal plĕnh."
"Daniel answered and said: “Blessed be the name of God forever and ever, For wisdom and might are His.","Đơ̆ng noh, Đaniel pơih 'bơ̆r pơma khan: Kơkuh bơnê kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ling-lang hlong hloi! Yua kơ tơdrong hơgei păng mơsêh lăm Sư."
"And He changes the times and the seasons; He removes kings and raises up kings; He gives wisdom to the wise And knowledge to those who have understanding.","Đơ̆ng Sư boih mă tơplih khei 'năr, bơyan, pơjing pơdơ̆ng pơtao păng ăn tơdrong gơh hơgei hlôh wao kơ lu bơngai hơgei păng ăn tơdrong hlôh băt kơ lu bơngai hơdah."
"He reveals deep and secret things; He knows what is in the darkness, And light dwells with Him.","Đơ̆ng Sư boih mă tơbăt dôm tơdrong jrŭ ataih mă hlơp: Sư băt tôm tơdrong. Tơ lăm măng mu păng tơdrong hơdah oei lăm Sư."
"“I thank You and praise You, O God of my fathers; You have given me wisdom and might, And have now made known to me what we asked of You, For You have made known to us the king’s demand.”","Ơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei inh!

"Therefore Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon. He went and said thus to him: “Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon; take me before the king, and I will tell the king the interpretation.”","Thoi noh na Đaniel năm tơ hnam Ariok bơngai mă pơtao athei sư năm pơlôch lu bơngai hơgei lăm Babilôn; păng kư̆m khan kơ sư thoi âu: 'Nĕ pơlôch lu bơngai hơgei Babilôn mă-lei apinh ih năm ba inh 'bơ̆t anăp pơtao na inh gô tơblang ăn tơdrong pơtao apo noh."
"Then Arioch quickly brought Daniel before the king, and said thus to him, “I have found a man of the captives of Judah, who will make known to the king the interpretation.”","Đơ̆ng noh Ariok hăt hot hloi năm ba Đaniel tơ pơtao păng khan kơ pơtao thoi âu: Inh đei chă 'bôh minh 'nu lăm lu kon sâu Juđa mă bơ̆n rôp pơm bơnă, bơngai noh gô tơblang tơbăt ăn kơ ih pơtao."
"The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, “Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and its interpretation?”","Pơtao khan kơ Đaniel, mă đe juăt kơ krao sư Beltơsatsar thoi âu: Hăm trŏ ưh ih gơh tơblang ăn kơ inh apo 'bôh noh, wă tơblang thoi yơ?"
"Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, “The secret which the king has demanded, the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, and the soothsayers cannot declare to the king.","Đaniel dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp pơtao drơ̆ng thoi âu: Tơdrong hlơp mă pơtao wă kơ băt, na mă dôm lu bơngai hơgei lu bơngai hlôh wao, lu pơjâu tă ưh kơ đei bu gơh tơblang ăn kơ ih băt ôh."
"But there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will be in the latter days. Your dream, and the visions of your head upon your bed, were these","Mă-lei minh 'nu Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei oei tơ kơpal plĕnh gô tơbăt ăn tơdrong hlơp; păng tơbăt hloi kơ pơtao Nebukatnessar băt tơdrong wă truh tơ anăp âu kơnh, lăm năr wă tôch thoi âu: Tơdrong ih apo păng đei 'bôh kơplah ih 'bĭch kơpal giơng noh."
"As for you, O king, thoughts came to your mind while on your bed, about what would come to pass after this; and He who reveals secrets has made known to you what will be.","Ơ pơtao kơplah ih 'bĭch kơpal giơng đei tơdrong ih tơchĕng ning-mônh gô đei tơdrong truh, thoi noh yang mă đei tơbăt tơdrong hlơp kơ pơtao 'bôh noh gô truh."
"But as for me, this secret has not been revealed to me because I have more wisdom than anyone living, but for our sakes who make known the interpretation to the king, and that you may know the thoughts of your heart.","Gah inh, tơdrong mă hlơp noh đei tơ'bôh boih kơ inh, ưh kơ sĭ kơ đơ̆ng inh gơh hơgei hloh kơ bơngai nai ôh lăm lu bơngai mă oei arih; mă-lei wă roi tơbăt ăn kơ pơtao 'bôh nhen păng ăn kơ pơtao băt mă lăm đon tơchĕng."
"“You, O king, were watching; and behold, a great image! This great image, whose splendor was excellent, stood before you; and its form was awesome.","Ơ pơtao, pơtao lăng păng âu, đei minh pôm rup man tih. Rup man noh tih păng hlĭch chrơp; dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp pơtao păng rup hơbŏ krưp tơpă."
"This image’s head was of fine gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze","Kơ̆l rup âu man hăm maih rơgoh, kơtơh hăm ti sư man hăm hu; klak hăm blu sư man păng kong"
"its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay.","tơkong man păng bơsei păng tơpang jơ̆ng minh puăt man păng bơsei minh puăt păng lơ̆n."
"You watched while a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the image on its feet of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces.","Pơtao oei lăng pơglăn tơ rup man noh dĭng truh tơ đei minh pôm tơmo ưh kơ trŏ đơ̆ng ti kon bơngai klơ̆m, năm hơtat tơ tơpang jơ̆ng mă man păng bơsei hăm teh lơ̆n noh păng jơ̆ng noh pơchah đĭ."
"Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed together, and became like chaff from the summer threshing floors; the wind carried them away so that no trace of them was found. And the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.","Đang kơ noh lu maih, hu, kong bơsei păng lơ̆n kư̆m pơchah đĭ, jing thoi hla đuih hla đăm, thoi hơnong 'ba đông tơ anih pơjuă 'ba bơyan phang, tơ'bơ̆p kial dơhlu pơđông đĭ, chă lăng sư pă đei 'bôh dơ̆ng, mă-lei tơmo đêl hơtat kơ tơpang jơ̆ng noh jing minh pôm kông tih păng 'bĕnh tơ jơ̆p teh đak."
"“This is the dream. Now we will tell the interpretation of it before the king.","Noh boih tơdrong ih apo 'bôh. Dang ei lu nhôn gô tơblang ăn 'bơ̆t anăp ih."
"You, O king, are a king of kings. For the God of heaven has given you a kingdom, power, strength, and glory","Ơ pơtao, pơtao kơ lu pơtao, yua kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei kơpal plĕnh đei ăn boih teh đak, gơh kĕ pran kơtang păng tơdrong ư-ang kơ pơtao."
"and wherever the children of men dwell, or the beasts of the field and the birds of the heaven, He has given them into your hand, and has made you ruler over them all—you are this head of gold.","Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei đei ăn boih tơ lăm ti pơtao dôm lu adrĕch kon bơngai, lu kon sem brem, lu sem păr, tơ jơ̆p-jang anih mă khan lu sư oei tơ yơ, Sư kư̆m đei ăn pơtao pơgơ̆r đĭ-đăng; thoi noh kơ̆l pơm hăm maih noh ih boih."
"But after you shall arise another kingdom inferior to yours; then another, a third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over all the earth.","Mă-lei đơ̆ng rŏng kơ ih, gô đei minh pôm char nai, iung blah tơrăn 'biơ̆ kơ dêh char pơtao ih; đơ̆ng noh đei dơ̆ng dêh char mă pêng, wă khan kong gô pơgơ̆r jơ̆p kơ teh đak."
"And the fourth kingdom shall be as strong as iron, inasmuch as iron breaks in pieces and shatters everything; and like iron that crushes, that kingdom will break in pieces and crush all the others.","Đei dơ̆ng dêh char mă puăn pran thoi bơsei yua kơ bơsei gô pơm pơchah kơ dôm tơmam, thoi noh dêh noh gô pơm kơ đe pơchah đĭ hĕch hoch thoi bơsei pơm kơ tơmam noh."
"Whereas you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter’s clay and partly of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; yet the strength of the iron shall be in it, just as you saw the iron mixed with ceramic clay.","Bê̆ gah ih đei 'bôh tơpang hơnglâu jơ̆ng minh puăt hăm bơsei minh puăt hăm teh lơ̆n, noh wă khan minh pôm char gô klaih asong; mă-lei lăm dêh char gô đei dêh char mơ'nah pran thoi bơsei, kiơ̆ thoi ih đei 'bôh bơsei hrâu hăm teh lơ̆n."
"And as the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly fragile.","Lu hơnglâu jơ̆ng minh puăt hăm bơsei minh puăt hăm lơ̆n."
"As you saw iron mixed with ceramic clay, they will mingle with the seed of men; but they will not adhere to one another, just as iron does not mix with clay.","Ih đei 'bôh bơsei hrâu hăm lơ̆n dêh noh kư̆m đei minh puăt dêh char pran dêh char tơrăn, noh lu sư tơhrâu băl adrĕch kon bơngai; mă-lei sư ưh kơ đei tơklep băl, kư̆m thoi bơsei ưh kơ tơklep hăm lơ̆n."
"And in the days of these kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed; and the kingdom shall not be left to other people; it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.","Lăm chăl lu pơtao 'nâu Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei kơpal plĕnh gô pơdŏng minh pôm dêh char ưh kơ đei layơ hiong răm, tơdrong dêh char noh pơgơ̆r ưh kơ đei minh adrĕch kon pơlei nai, kĕ tơgar iŏk, na sư iung pơrăm pơlôch đĭ lu dêh char mă đei adrol sơ̆ noh, na kơdih sư gô kơjăp ling-lang hloi."
"Inasmuch as you saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold—the great God has made known to the king what will come to pass after this. The dream is certain, and its interpretation is sure.”","Kŭm thoi ih đei 'bôh tơmo tơphĕ đơ̆ng kông, ưh kơ đei ti bu klơ̆m, hơtŭt pơchah kơ bơsei, kong, teh lơ̆n, hu păng maih.

"Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, prostrate before Daniel, and commanded that they should present an offering and incense to him.","Đơ̆ng noh pơtao Nebukatnessar drap, kơkuh kơ Đaniel păng athei pơyơ̆r ăn tơmam apah păng pơgang 'bâu phu ăn kơ Đaniel."
"The king answered Daniel, and said, “Truly your God is the God of gods, the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, since you could reveal this secret.”","Đang kơ noh pơtao pơih nơ̆r pơma hăm Đaniel thoi âu: Sĭt tơpă boih, Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei iĕm jơ̆ Yang kơ lu yang păng yŏng kơ lu pơtao, đơ̆ng Sư tơbăt ăn tơdrong hlơp, yua kơ ih đei tơblang boih mă ưh kơ đei bu băt âu."
"Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many great gifts; and he made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief administrator over all the wise men of Babylon.","Pơtao pôk ăn Đaniel pơm tih păng pơjao ăn kơ sư tơmam mă gĭt dêh. Pơtao ăn kơ sư pơgơ̆r đĭ lăm char Babilôn."
"Also Daniel petitioned the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego over the affairs of the province of Babylon; but Daniel sat in the gate of the king.","Đaniel apinh pơtao, thoi noh pơtao kư̆m ăn kơ Sadrak, Mêsak păng Abetnigo jang pơm tih lăm char Babilôn, mă-lei Đaniel oei jang kơtă lăm hnam pơtao."
"Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits and its width six cubits. He set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.","Pơtao Nebukatnessar man minh pôm rup hăm maih, kơjung tơdrâu-jĭt hơgăt păng tih sư tơdrâu hơgăt; man pơdơ̆ng tơ lăm thŭng glă Dura, lăm char Babilôn."
"And King Nebuchadnezzar sent word to gather together the satraps, the administrators, the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.","Đơ̆ng noh, pơtao Nebukatnessar krao athei lu kuan tih, 'bok pơgơ̆r linh bơ̆jang lăm hnam pơtao, lu yŏng pơgơ̆r lăm tơring.

"So the satraps, the administrators, the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces gathered together for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.","Thoi noh, na lu yŏng kuan tih, yŏng pơgơ̆r linh, yŏng wei jên, lu yŏng bơ̆jang lăm hnam pơtao, yŏng pơgơ̆r tơring kư̆m truh đĭ tơ noh wă akŭm pơih blŭng-a wă kơkuh kơ rup man ei mă đơ̆ng pơtao athei đe man keh boih; đĭ-đăng lu sư dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp tơklă rup man mă pơtao đei man noh."
"Then a herald cried aloud: “To you it is commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages","'Bơ̆t ei na đei minh 'nu bơngai bơ̆jang pơih pơma, pơma 'bơ̆r re roi tơbăt khan: Đĭ kon pơlei đĭ dêh char, đĭ nơ̆r pơma 'nâu nơ̆r pơkă athei iĕm."
"that at the time you hear the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre, and psaltery, in symphony with all kinds of music, you shall fall down and worship the gold image that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up","Tơdah iĕm kơtơ̆ng keng, brŏ, tơgiĕp, 'lal, lillul đe hlôm re, lei lu iĕm athei drap bon kơkuh kơ rup man mă pơtao pơdơ̆ng âu"

"So at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the horn, flute, harp, and lyre, in symphony with all kinds of music, all the people, nations, and languages fell down and worshiped the gold image which King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.","Thoi noh, na mưh lu kon tơring kơtơ̆ng keng, brŏ, tơgiĕp, 'lal re, đĭ-đăng teh đak, rim kơ nơ̆r pơma, drap đĭ wă kơkuh kơ rup man mă pơtao Nebukatnessar đei pơm noh."
"Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came forward and accused the Jews.","Kơplah noh dôm lu bơngai hơgeia năm jê̆ răp lăng wă kêng lu bơngai Juđa."
"They spoke and said to King Nebuchadnezzar, “O king, live forever!","Thoi noh lu đe ei ôr năm roi kơ pơtao Nebukatnessar thoi âu: Ơ pơtao, hơpơi kơ ih đei arih ling-lang!"
"You, O king, have made a decree that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre, and psaltery, in symphony with all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the gold image","Ơ pơtao ih boih pơkă, bơngai bu kơtơ̆ng keng, brŏ, 'lal re, athei đĭ-đăng kon bơngai drap kơkuh kơ rup man păng maih noh."

"There are certain Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego; these men, O king, have not paid due regard to you. They do not serve your gods or worship the gold image which you have set up.”","Na tơ âu đei lu bơngai Juđa mă 'bok pơtao đei pôk ăn kơ lu sư pơm tih pơgơ̆r tơring Babilôn, noh jơ̆ Sadrak, Mêsak, Abetnigo; ơ pơtao lu đe noh ưh kơ hli yom kơ ih tŏ sĕt hloi.

"Then Nebuchadnezzar, in rage and fury, gave the command to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego. So they brought these men before the king.","Thoi noh pơtao Nebukatnessar 'brik blĕk hil, athei đe chông Sadrak, Mêsak, Abetnigo năm tơ sư, na đe năm ba lu đe ei truh 'bơ̆t anăp pơtao."
"Nebuchadnezzar spoke, saying to them, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the gold image which I have set up?","Pơtao Nebukatnessar pơma khan kơ lu sư thoi âu: Ơ Sadrak, Mêsak, Abetnigo hăm trŏ kơ lu iĕm kuă kơkuh kơ yang inh păng kư̆m kuă kơkuh kơ rup yang mă inh 'nao man păng maih noh hei hă?"
"Now if you are ready at the time you hear the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre, and psaltery, in symphony with all kinds of music, and you fall down and worship the image which I have made, good! But if you do not worship, you shall be cast immediately into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. And who is the god who will deliver you from my hands?”","Na dang ei, dah iĕm kơtơ̆ng jơwa keng, brŏ, 'lal păng đĭ lu tơmam reh, na iĕm athei drap bon tơ teh wă kơkuh kơ rup yang mă inh đei man, lei huay mă-lei dah iĕm ưh kơ drap bon kơkuh, jơ noh hloi boih đe gô klơ̆m lu iĕm tơ lăm ŭnh kơdơ̆r to.

"Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego answered and said to the king, “O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter.","Sadrak, Mêsak, Abetnigo tơl pơtao thoi âu: Ơ pơtao Nebukatnessar, gah tơdrong noh, ưh kơ kăl kơ nhôn roi kơ ih."
"If that is the case, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us from your hand, O king.","'Nâu ơ pơtao!

"But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods, nor will we worship the gold image which you have set up.”","Mă ưh, ơ pơtao, apinh ih athei băt lu nhôn ưh kơ wă kơkuh dah bơ̆jang kơ yang ih păng kư̆m ưh kơkuh ôh kơ rup yang mă ih 'nao man hăm maih noh."
"Then Nebuchadnezzar was full of fury, and the expression on his face changed toward Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego. He spoke and commanded that they heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated.","Đơ̆ng noh pơtao Nebukatnessar rai blĕk muh măt sư đum rak hil kơ Sadrak, Mêsak, Abetnigo păng krao đe rŭk ŭnh mă dêh tŏ hloh dang tơpơh wơ̆t kơ adrol hei."
"And he commanded certain mighty men of valor who were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, and cast them into the burning fiery furnace.","Wơh lu bơngai pran kơtang, lăm khŭl linh sư năm rôp chô̆ Sadrak, Mêsak, Abetnigo, na athei năm klơ̆m hơtat lăm ŭnh kơdơ̆r noh."
"Then these men were bound in their coats, their trousers, their turbans, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.","Đe hơloh rôp chô̆ hloi pêng 'nu tơdăm noh, chô̆ hơbĭ hăm hơbĕn ao, mă ao tai 'nguaih hai na klơ̆m lu sư tơ lăm ŭnh kơdơ̆r noh."
"Therefore, because the king’s command was urgent, and the furnace exceedingly hot, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego.","Đơ̆ng noh pơtao athei gơnhĕk dêh, mă ŭnh noh kư̆m tŏ hloh tơpă, na lu bơngai klơ̆m Sadrak, Mêsak, Abetnigo, noh ŭnh dơhlông sa lu sư kư̆m lôch đĭ."
"And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.","Gah lu pêng 'nu lu tơdăm, Sadrak, Mêsak, Abetnigo klơ̆m lu sư tơ lăm ŭnh kơdơ̆r noh akâu lu sư oei chô̆ đĕch."
"Then King Nebuchadnezzar was astonished; and he rose in haste and spoke, saying to his counselors, “Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire?” They answered and said to the king, “True, O king.”","Dang ei, pơtao Nebukatnessar 'bôh hlĭch tơpă, na iung hăt hot, pơma kơ yŏng wang pơđâu thoi âu: Dôm lu bơngai mă inh đei athei đe chô̆ păng klơ̆m tơ lăm ŭnh kơdơ̆r hăm trŏ kơ pêng 'nu đĕch?

"“Look!” he answered, “I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire; and they are not hurt, and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.”","Pơtao khan dơ̆ng: 'Nâu inh 'bôh đei puăn 'nu bơngai ưh kơ đei chô̆, yak năm lăm ŭnh, mă-lei ŭnh ưh kơ sa; păng bơngai mă puăn noh hơbŏ thoi minh 'nu kon tơdăm yang."
"Then Nebuchadnezzar went near the mouth of the burning fiery furnace and spoke, saying, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, servants of the Most High God, come out, and come here.” Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego came from the midst of the fire.","Đơ̆ng noh pơtao Nebukatnessar năm nger tơ jê̆ 'măng ŭnh kơdơ̆r noh, krao: Ơ Sadrak, Mêsak, Abetnigo jơ̆ đĭch đam Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Tih hloh, lĕch păng năm tơ âu bĕ!

"And the satraps, administrators, governors, and the king’s counselors gathered together, and they saw these men on whose bodies the fire had no power; the hair of their head was not singed nor were their garments affected, and the smell of fire was not on them.","Lu yŏng tơring, lu yŏng linh păng đĭ lu bơngai pơgơ̆r.

"Nebuchadnezzar spoke, saying, “Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, who sent His Angel and delivered His servants who trusted in Him, and they have frustrated the king’s word, and yielded their bodies, that they should not serve nor worship any god except their own God!","Pơtao Nebukatnessar pơma khan dơ̆ng thoi âu: Trŏ bơnê kơkuh tơpă kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Sadrak, Mêsak, Abetnigo, Sư đei wơh boih Linh jang 'lơ̆ng Sư păng dŏng pơklaih lu đĭch đam Sư, mă gơnang kơ Sư lu sư ưh kơ pơm kiơ̆ kơ pơtao păng jao akâu jăn, wă huay kơ bơ̆jang dah kơkuh kơ yang nai 'nguaih kơ 'Bok Kei-Dei lu sư."
"Therefore I make a decree that any people, nation, or language which speaks anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made an ash heap; because there is no other God who can deliver like this.”","Thoi noh inh ăn nơ̆r tơtă âu: Mă khan kon pơlei ayơ, dêh char ayơ, nơ̆r pơma kiơ, dah đei bu pơma kơnê̆ kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Sadrak, Mêsak, Abetnigo gô koh pơhĕch sư, hnam dơnŏ noh kư̆m gô jing mơ̆r kơ teh, yua kơ ưh kơ đei yang kiơ mă gơh dŏng pơklaih thoi 'nâu."

"Nebuchadnezzar the king, To all peoples, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you.","Pơtao Nebukatnessar roi tơbăt ăn kơ đĭ-đăng kon pơlei, lu dêh char, rim nơ̆r pơma, oei tơ jơ̆p kơpal teh thoi âu: Hơpơi kơ iĕm đei hiôk-hian rai dêh!"
"I thought it good to declare the signs and wonders that the Most High God has worked for me.","Tơdrong hiôk inh na inh wă roi tơbăt ăn kơ lu iĕm, dôm tơdra hlĭch păng tơdrong chrơp mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Tih hloh đei pơm ăn kơ inh."
"How great are His signs, And how mighty His wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, And His dominion is from generation to generation.","Ô! Dôm tơdrong mơsêh Sư tơdrong hlĭch chrơp Sư tih dêh tơpă, dêh char Sư jơ̆ dêh char oei oei ling-lang, tơdrong Sư pơgơ̆r oei oei rim jơhnơr."
"I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace.","Inh Nebukatnessar, oei pơdơh hiôk lăm hnam inh păng rai ư-ang lăm hnam pơtao inh."
"I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts on my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.","Inh đei apo 'bôh pơm kơ inh hli tơtăm; dôm tơdrong inh tơchĕng 'bơ̆t inh oei kơpal giơng păng dôm kơ̆l 'ngok inh 'bôh pơm kơ inh hơwơ̆l hơwang."
"Therefore I issued a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.","Thoi noh inh chih roi tơbăt, athei ba đĭ-đăng lu bơngai hơgei lăm char Babilôn năm truh tơ inh, wă kơ lu sư tơblang tơdrong inh apo 'bôh."
"Then the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers came in, and I told them the dream; but they did not make known to me its interpretation.","Dang ei lu bơngai pơm tih lu bơngai Kalđê păng lu pơjâu truh đĭ, inh roi ăn đĭ-đăng tơdrong inh apo 'bôh kơ lu sư, mă-lei lu sư ưh kơ đei bu gơh tơblang ăn kơ inh."
"But at last Daniel came before me (his name is Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god; in him is the Spirit of the Holy God), and I told the dream before him, saying","Đơ̆ng rŏng, đei Đaniel, đe anăn sư Beltơsatsar kiơ̆ kơ anăn yang inh, sư đei mơsêh đơ̆ng lu yang nai, thoi noh năm dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp inh.

"“Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, because I know that the Spirit of the Holy God is in you, and no secret troubles you, explain to me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and its interpretation.","Ơ Beltơsatsar, ih pơm yŏng đĭ kơ lu bơngai hơgei, inh băt đei yang 'lơ̆ng oei lăm ih păng ưh kơ đei tơdrong kiơ mă hlơp mă tơnat kơ ih, thoi ei boih na apinh ih tơblang ăn kơ inh tơdrong inh apo 'bôh păng tơblang kơ inh bĕ."
"“These were the visions of my head while on my bed: I was looking, and behold, A tree in the midst of the earth, And its height was great.","'Nâu mă dôm tơdrong inh đei 'bôh tơ lăm kơ̆l inh kơplah inh oei 'bĭch kơpal giơng. Inh pơglăn lăng na 'nâu, tơ lăm teh âu đei tơm 'long tih hlĭch tơpă."
"The tree grew and became strong; Its height reached to the heavens, And it could be seen to the ends of all the earth.","'Long noh rai tih rai kơjăp; kơnhŏng wĕch sư hơtŭt kơ plĕnh păng mă đe oei tôch kơ teh kư̆m oei tơmang 'bôh sư."
"Its leaves were lovely, Its fruit abundant, And in it was food for all.

"“I saw in the visions of my head while on my bed, and there was a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven.","Inh lăng lu tơdrong lăm kơ̆l 'ngok inh 'bôh, kơplah inh oei 'bĭch kơpal giơng păng âu, inh đei 'bôh minh 'nu yang 'lơ̆ng rơgoh wei-lăng tơnơm 'long noh sư jur đơ̆ng plĕnh."
"He cried aloud and said thus: ‘Chop down the tree and cut off its branches, Strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit.

"Nevertheless leave the stump and roots in the earth, Bound with a band of iron and bronze, In the tender grass of the field.

"‘This decision is by the decree of the watchers, And the sentence by the word of the holy ones, In order that the living may know That the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, Gives it to whomever He will, And sets over it the lowest of men.’","Tơdrong hơgăt noh đơ̆ng lu yŏng mă wei-lăng pơkă păng nơ̆r lu bơngai 'lơ̆ng rơgoh đei roi tơbăt, wă kơ lu bơngai oei arih băt kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Tih hloh pơgơ̆r lăm teh đak kon bơngai; Sư wă ăn kơ bu mơ̆ng kơ Sư wă păng gô tơiung lu bơngai răm-'băm tơ anih pơgơ̆r noh."
"“This dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, have seen.

"Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonished for a time, and his thoughts troubled him. So the king spoke, and said, “Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its interpretation trouble you.” Belteshazzar answered and said, “My lord, may the dream concern those who hate you, and its interpretation concern your enemies!","Dang ei, Đaniel, mă krao Beltơsatsar, jing kơmlo wă đunh păng dôm tơdrong tơchĕng pơm ăn kơ sư hơwơ̆l.

"All this came upon King Nebuchadnezzar.","Đĭ-đăng tơdrong noh tă truh kơ pơtao Nebukatnessar ngăl."
"At the end of the twelve months he was walking about the royal palace of Babylon.","Hlôi kơ mơjĭt-'bar khei, kơplah pơtao yak nơnăm rok cham hnam pơtao Babilôn."
"The king spoke, saying, “Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for a royal dwelling by my mighty power and for the honor of my majesty?”","Na sư khan: 'Nâu ưh kơ trŏ hă pơlei tih Babilôn mă đei pơdơ̆ng đơ̆ng tơdrong pran inh, wă pơm pơlei tơm lăm chăl pơtao inh păng wă pơư pơang 'lơ̆ng rŏ kơ inh."
"While the word was still in the king’s mouth, a voice fell from heaven: “King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken: the kingdom has departed from you!","Nơ̆r pơma tam mă tôch, na đei hloi nơ̆r đơ̆ng plĕnh ti khan thoi âu: Ơ pơtao Nebukatnessar, đei tơbăt kơ ih boih: Anih pơtao pă đei tơ ih boih."
"And they shall drive you from men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. They shall make you eat grass like oxen; and seven times shall pass over you, until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever He chooses.”","Đe gô tơweh lê̆ ih đơ̆ng kon bơngai, ih gô oei hơdai lu sem brem; kư̆m sa 'nhĕt thoi rơmo, dĭng truh tơpơh sơnăm, dĭng mă ih 'blŏk băt thoi âu: Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Tih hloh pơgơ̆r teh đak kon bơngai păng Sư wă ăn kơ bu mơ̆ng kơ Sư wă."
"That very hour the word was fulfilled concerning Nebuchadnezzar; he was driven from men and ate grass like oxen; his body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hair had grown like eagles’ feathers and his nails like birds’ claws.","Kơplah lăm jơ noh, nơ̆r pơma noh đei trŏ sĭt kơ pơtao Nebukatnessar, pơtao mă đe gô puh tơweh đơ̆ng kon bơngai; sa 'nhĕt thoi rơmo; akâu jăn pơtao gô hơiuh kơ đak ngom jur đơ̆ng plĕnh, dĭng truh sŏk kơ̆l sư chăt thoi sŏk sem kring, tơngiơh sư kư̆m thoi tơngiơh sem brem."
"And at the end of the time I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted my eyes to heaven, and my understanding returned to me; and I blessed the Most High and praised and honored Him who lives forever: For His dominion is an everlasting dominion, And His kingdom is from generation to generation.","Dĭng truh tôch kơ năr đêl pơkă, inh âu, Nebukatnessar inh ngoi muh măt tơ plĕnh, tơdrong hơgei đei dơ̆ng tơ inh păng inh pơư pơang anăn Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Tih hloh.

"All the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing; He does according to His will in the army of heaven And among the inhabitants of the earth.

"At the same time my reason returned to me, and for the glory of my kingdom, my honor and splendor returned to me. My counselors and nobles resorted to me, I was restored to my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added to me.","Kơplah noh tơdrong hơgei đei dơ̆ng tơ lăm inh, inh đei ư-ang lăm dêh char pơtao inh, tơdrong krưp rŏ hơdah hơdong tơ inh dơ̆ng; dôm lu yŏng pơgơ̆r lu pơm tih gô năm kơkuh kơ inh.

"Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven, all of whose works are truth, and His ways justice. And those who walk in pride He is able to put down.","Dang ei inh, Nebukatnessar, bơnê kơkuh kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Pơtao rang mơnhal kơpal plĕnh; dôm tơdrong jang Sư tă kơ sĭt tơpă, lu trong gơlong Sư tơpăt; păng bơngai bu mă yak lăm trong pơang, Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei gô tơjur lê̆ sư."
"Belshazzar the king made a great feast for a thousand of his lords, and drank wine in the presence of the thousand.","Pơtao Belsatsar đei hơmet et sa tih sư krao wơ̆n đĭ minh-rơbâu 'nu kuan tih păng pơtao huch tơdrô 'bơ̆t anăp lu sư."
"While he tasted the wine, Belshazzar gave the command to bring the gold and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple which had been in Jerusalem, that the king and his lords, his wives, and his concubines might drink from them.","Belsatsar oei huch tơdrô, athei đe iŏk pơnhan maih, pơnhan hu mă đơ̆ng pơtao Nebukatnessar 'bă sư, mă đei iŏk kơchŏk đơ̆ng lăm hnam akŭm pơlei Jêrusalem noh, wă ăn kơ pơtao păng lu kuan tih, lu akăn tơm, akăn kơnhŏng pơtao kư̆m yua pơnhan noh huch."
"Then they brought the gold vessels that had been taken from the temple of the house of God which had been in Jerusalem; and the king and his lords, his wives, and his concubines drank from them.","Đe năm iŏk hloi boih, lu kơchŏk pơnhan maih mă đei iŏk đơ̆ng hnam akŭm Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei, đơ̆ng pơlei Jêrusalem; păng pơtao hăm lu kuan tih, lu akăn tơm, lu akăn kơnhŏng pơtao lu sư yua pơnhan noh huch tơdrô"
"They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold and silver, bronze and iron, wood and stone.","Thoi noh lu sư huch tơdrô păng drap kơkuh bơnê kơ rup yang đe man păng maih păng hu păng kong păng 'long păng bơsei păng tơmo."
"In the same hour the fingers of a man’s hand appeared and wrote opposite the lampstand on the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace; and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.","Lăm jơ noh hloi đei hơnglâu ti, chih tơ tơnăr hnam pơtao, tơklă 'bơ̆t anih dan jơ̆ng ŭnh kơđeng păng pơtao 'bôh hloi tơpang ti noh oei chih."
"Then the king’s countenance changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his hips were loosened and his knees knocked against each other.","Na muh măt pơtao păng đon tơchĕng sư tơplih pơm kơ sư hơwơ̆l hơwang; lu kơting rŏng sư pă tơklep păng 'bar pah kŭl-tăng sư pơpơ̆ hơtŭt băl."
"The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. The king spoke, saying to the wise men of Babylon, “Whoever reads this writing, and tells me its interpretation, shall be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold around his neck; and he shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.”","Pơtao krao ôr athei đe krao lu bơngai hơgei, lu bơngai gơh tơwir lu pơjâu bơngai Kalđê truh.

"Now all the king’s wise men came, but they could not read the writing, or make known to the king its interpretation.","Kơplah ei đĭ-đăng lu bơngai hơgei mơ̆t; mă-lei lu sư đŏk chư noh ưh kơ gơh, kư̆m ưh kơ gơh wă tơblang ăn kơ pơtao mơ̆n."
"Then King Belshazzar was greatly troubled, his countenance was changed, and his lords were astonished.","Pơtao Belsatsar bơngơ̆t dêh; muh măt sư rai pha; lu kuan pơgơ̆r hnam pơtao kư̆m hiơ̆k bơngơ̆t."
"The queen, because of the words of the king and his lords, came to the banquet hall. The queen spoke, saying, “O king, live forever! Do not let your thoughts trouble you, nor let your countenance change.","Yă pơtao, yua kơ kơtơ̆ng nơ̆r pơtao păng lu kuan tih đei pơma, na sư mơ̆t hloi tơ anih sŏng sa, sư khan thoi âu: Ơ pơtao, hơpơi kơ ih arih ling-lang!

"There is a man in your kingdom in whom is the Spirit of the Holy God. And in the days of your father, light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, were found in him; and King Nebuchadnezzar your father—your father the king—made him chief of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers.","Tơ lăm dêh char đei minh 'nu bơngai, đei Yang Bơhngol 'Lơ̆ng oei, lăm chăl 'bă ih đe đei 'bôh tơ lăm sư đei tơdrong hơdah, đei tơdrong hơgei, đei đon hlôh wao, tơdrong gơh hơgei nhen thoi Yang.

"Inasmuch as an excellent spirit, knowledge, understanding, interpreting dreams, solving riddles, and explaining enigmas were found in this Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar, now let Daniel be called, and he will give the interpretation.”","Yua kơ Đaniel mă pơtao 'bă đei anăn Beltơsatsar tơ lăm sư đei Yang Bơhngol 'Lơ̆ng arih 'lơ̆ng tơpă, đei tơdrong gơh hơgei, băt hlôh wao, wă tơblang lu tơdrong apo, tơblang dôm tơdrong mă hlơp kon bơngai ưh kơ băt păng pơm ăn kơ tơdrong hiơ̆k hơwơ̆l hơwang hiong đĭ.

"Then Daniel was brought in before the king. The king spoke, and said to Daniel, “Are you that Daniel who is one of the captives from Judah, whom my father the king brought from Judah?","Thoi noh đe năm ba Đaniel 'bơ̆t anăp pơtao.

"I have heard of you, that the Spirit of God is in you, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in you.","Inh đei kơtơ̆ng đe roi khan ih đei Yang Bơhngol 'Lơ̆ng lu Yang oei lăm ih păng đe đei 'bôh tơ lăm ih đei hơdah, gơh hơgei, hlôh wao păng gơh băt phara kơ đe."
"Now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing and make known to me its interpretation, but they could not give the interpretation of the thing.","Dang ei lu bơngai gơh tơwir, lu pơjâu đe năm ba truh tơ âu 'bơ̆t anăp inh boih ră wă kơ lu sư đŏk chư noh păng wă kơ tơblang ăn kơ inh; mă-lei lu sư ưh kơ gơh tơblang."
"And I have heard of you, that you can give interpretations and explain enigmas. Now if you can read the writing and make known to me its interpretation, you shall be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold around your neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.”","Inh đei kơtơ̆ng đe khan ih gơh tơblang păng pơm ăn kơ dôm tơdrong hơwơ̆l hơwang hiong đĭ.

"Then Daniel answered, and said before the king, “Let your gifts be for yourself, and give your rewards to another; yet I will read the writing to the king, and make known to him the interpretation.","Thoi noh Đaniel tơl pơma 'bơ̆t anăp pơtao thoi âu: Pơtao ih kư̆ kơ bơwei tơmam noh păng gô apah lu đe nai tơmam noh!

"O king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father a kingdom and majesty, glory and honor.","Ơ pơtao, Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Tih hloh đei ăn boih tang-dŏ pơtao păng tơdrong pơgơ̆r tih, tơdrong pơyom, tơdrong ư-ang kơ pơtao Nebukatnessar 'bă ih."
"And because of the majesty that He gave him, all peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him. Whomever he wished, he executed; whomever he wished, he kept alive; whomever he wished, he set up; and whomever he wished, he put down.","Yua kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei đei ăn boih kơ sư đei pơgơ̆r tih, na đĭ-đăng kon pơlei pơla jơ̆p kơ dêh char, đĭ khŭl bơngai rim kơ adrĕch tă kơ hli yom ngăl 'bơ̆t anăp sư păng hli yom kơ sư, sư pơlôch bu pơlôch, sư wă kơ bu arih, lê̆ arih.

"But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him.","Mă-lei yua kơ jơhngơ̆m sư pơang kơdih akâu, arăng kơ̆l na jing pơang, na sư hiong boih tang-dŏ pơtao păng đe ưh pă ư-ang kơ sư."
"Then he was driven from the sons of men, his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys. They fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till he knew that the Most High God rules in the kingdom of men, and appoints over it whomever He chooses.","Tơweh lê̆ sư đơ̆ng anih kon bơngai, jơhngơ̆m đon sư thoi sem brem păng sư kư̆m oei thoi aseh bri.

"“But you his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, although you knew all this.","Ơ Pơtao Belsatsar, kon pơtao Nebukatnessar ih kư̆m lei-lăi, mă ih băt boih dôm tơdrong noh ră, jơhngơ̆m ih kư̆m ưh kơ đei chu iŏk tŏ sĕt."
"And you have lifted yourself up against the Lord of heaven. They have brought the vessels of His house before you, and you and your lords, your wives and your concubines, have drunk wine from them. And you have praised the gods of silver and gold, bronze and iron, wood and stone, which do not see or hear or know; and the God who holds your breath in His hand and owns all your ways, you have not glorified.","Mă-lei pôk kơdih akâu blah Kră Yang kơpal plĕnh păng iŏk pơđĭ lu kơchŏk pơnhan hu maih đơ̆ng hnam akŭm Kră Yang păng yua huch tơdrô hơdai hăm lu yŏng lăm hnam pơtao, lu akăn tơm, akăn kơnhŏng pơtao.

"Then the fingers of the hand were sent from Him, and this writing was written.","Thoi noh đơ̆ng anih Sư đei wơh tơpang ti truh tơ âu păng đei chih lu chư âu"
"“And this is the inscription that was written: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.","Lu chư mă đei boih noh wă khan thoi âu: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, PARSIN."
"This is the interpretation of each word. MENE : God has numbered your kingdom, and finished it","Âu wă tơblang lu chư noh: Mene wă khan Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei jô̆ boih dêh char pơtao păng wă pơtôch lê̆."
"TEKEL : You have been weighed in the balances, and found wanting","Tekel wă khan: Pơtao đei kŏng boih kơpal 'long kŏng păng 'bôh ưh kơ tôm."
"PERES : Your kingdom has been divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.”","Parsin wă khan: Dêh char pơtao ih gô klah asong, ăn kơ bơngai Mêdi păng bơngai Pherơsơ."
"Then Belshazzar gave the command, and they clothed Daniel with purple and put a chain of gold around his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.","Kiơ̆ thoi nơ̆r pơtao Belsatsar, đe iŏk ao pơtao pơhrŭk hloi kơ Đaniel; tơ'băk ăn kơ sư kon kiơng maih păng tơbăt hloi pôk sư pơm tih mă pêng lăm lu 'bok pơgơ̆r dêh char sư."
"That very night Belshazzar, king of the Chaldeans, was slain.","Lăm măng noh hloi pơtao Belsatsar bơngai Kalđê đe pơlôch."
"And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about sixty-two years old.","Đơ̆ng noh Đarius bơngai Mêdi iŏk dêh char, kơplah âu sư dang tơdrâu-jĭt 'bar sơnăm."
"It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom one hundred and twenty satraps, to be over the whole kingdom","Pơtao Đarius pôk ăn minh-hrĕng 'bar-jĭt 'nu pơm yŏng pơgơ̆r tơring, wă asong băl pơgơ̆r jơ̆p tơ lăm dêh char sư."
"and over these, three governors, of whom Daniel was one, that the satraps might give account to them, so that the king would suffer no loss.","Tơ kơpal 'biơ̆ kơ lu đe noh đei pêng 'nu jing kơiĕng pơtao, lăm noh đei Đaniel.

"Then this Daniel distinguished himself above the governors and satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king gave thought to setting him over the whole realm.","Na Đaniel pơm yŏng tih hloh 'biơ̆ kơ bre 'bar 'nu noh păng kư̆m tih hloh kơ lu yŏng pơgơ̆r tơring, yua kơ sư đei tơdrong gơh hơgei; na pơtao pôk ăn kơ sư pơm tih hloh kơ đĭ-đăng lăm char sư."
"So the governors and satraps sought to find some charge against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find no charge or fault, because he was faithful; nor was there any error or fault found in him.","Bre kơiĕng pơtao păng lu yŏng pơgơ̆r tơring chă đon wă 'maih pơrăm, kêng Đaniel lăm tơdrong pơgơ̆r teh đak.

"Then these men said, “We shall not find any charge against this Daniel unless we find it against him concerning the law of his God.”","Thoi noh lu đe noh khan thoi âu; lu bơ̆n chă tơdrong wă kơ kêng Đaniel ưh kơ đei, tơdah lu bơ̆n ưh kơ chă lăm khôi juăt Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei sư."
"So these governors and satraps thronged before the king, and said thus to him: “King Darius, live forever!","Bre kơiĕng pơtao păng yŏng pơgơ̆r tơring lu sư năm khan păng apinh 'Bok pơtao thoi âu: Ơ pơtao Đarius, hơpơi kơ ih arih ling-lang!"
"All the governors of the kingdom, the administrators and satraps, the counselors and advisors, have consulted together to establish a royal statute and to make a firm decree, that whoever petitions any god or man for thirty days, except you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions.","Đĭ kơ lu yŏng kơiĕng pơtao păng yŏng linh păng yŏng pơgơ̆r tơring lăm dêh char, lu bơngai bơ̆jang tih, lu sư pơđâu băl lăp đon boih wă apinh ih ăn tơdrong pơkăm gơret tơpă lăm pêng-jĭt năr, bơngai bu mă krao khan kơ yang nai dah krao apinh bu nai 'nguaih kơ pơtao, na, ơ pơtao, lu bơngai noh klơ̆m hơtat lê̆ sư tơ lăm war dăm-brang."
"Now, O king, establish the decree and sign the writing, so that it cannot be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which does not alter.”","Dang ei, ơ pơtao, chih pơkăm tơbăt bĕ păng kĭ hloi măt ih lăm noh, wă kơ kĭ huay kơ tơplih, kiơ̆ thoi tơdrong juăt bơngai Mêđi păng bơngai Pherơsơ, ưh pă gơh tơplih boih."
"Therefore King Darius signed the written decree.","Đơ̆ng noh pơtao Đarius chih hloi hla bơar pơkăm na kĭ anăn sư."
"Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went home. And in his upper room, with his windows open toward Jerusalem, he knelt down on his knees three times that day, and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as was his custom since early days.","Kơplah Đaniel kơtơ̆ng tơdrong pơkăm noh pơtao kĭ anăn sư boih, na sư brŏk tơ hnam sư, lu 'măng-'mŏk iĕ gah Jêrusalem sư pơih đĭ.

"Then these men assembled and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.","Kơplah dang ei lu đe noh pơtơm băl akŭm, 'bôh Đaniel oei krao khan kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei."
"And they went before the king, and spoke concerning the king’s decree: “Have you not signed a decree that every man who petitions any god or man within thirty days, except you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?” The king answered and said, “The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which does not alter.”","Lu sư năm tơ pơtao păng roi kơ pơtao, gah tơdrong mă sư đei kĭ boih lăm hla bơar pơkơ̆m noh thoi âu: Ơ pơtao ih đei kĭ boih lăm hla bơar pơkơ̆m noh păng pơkă lăm pêng-jĭt năr, dah đei bu krao khan kơ yang nai dah krao khan kơ bơngai nai 'nguaih kơ ih na gô klơ̆m lê̆ sư tơ lăm war dăm-brang hăm trŏ ưh?

"So they answered and said before the king, “That Daniel, who is one of the captives from Judah, does not show due regard for you, O king, or for the decree that you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day.”","Lu sư tơl păng khan kơ pơtao thoi âu: Đaniel minh 'nu lăm lu kon sâu Juđa mă pơm đĭch, sư ưh kơ wă mơ̆ng, ưh kơ wă pơyom kơ pơtao hơya tŏ sĕt, ơ pơtao, mă truh tơdrong pơtao pơkơ̆m păng kĭ anăn boih ră, mă-lei sư kư̆ oei krao khan rim năr pêng wơ̆t."
"And the king, when he heard these words, was greatly displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him; and he labored till the going down of the sun to deliver him.","Kơplah pơtao kơtơ̆ng lu nơ̆r noh, thoi noh sư sơ'ngon dêh; pơtao wă 'maih pơklaih Đaniel ră păng gô dĭng 'năr mơ̆t, adrin đĭ jơhngơ̆m chă trong wă pơklaih Đaniel."
"Then these men approached the king, and said to the king, “Know, O king, that it is the law of the Medes and Persians that no decree or statute which the king establishes may be changed.”","Mă-lei lu đe noh năm khan kơ pơtao thoi âu: Ơ pơtao, apinh ih 'blŏk kiơ̆ kơ tơdrong juăt bơngai Mêđi păng bơngai Pherơsơ, tơdrong pơkơ̆m dah tơdrong juăt ayơ đei pơjing boih, ưh pă gơh tơplih dơ̆ng."
"So the king gave the command, and they brought Daniel and cast him into the den of lions. But the king spoke, saying to Daniel, “Your God, whom you serve continually, He will deliver you.”","Thoi noh pơtao athei krao Đaniel păng athei đe klơ̆m sư tơ lăm war dăm-brang. Pơtao khan kơ Đaniel thoi âu: Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei mă ih oei bơ̆jang, gô pơklaih ih."
"Then a stone was brought and laid on the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the signets of his lords, that the purpose concerning Daniel might not be changed.","Đe iŏk hloi minh pôm tơmo tih wă đơ̆p 'măng sơlŭng păng pơtao chơ̆m tơdra sư păng tơdra lu yŏng pơgơ̆r tơring hai, wă kơ ưh kơ đei tơdrong kiơ mă gơh tơplih tơdrong truh kơ Đaniel."
"Now the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting; and no musicians were brought before him. Also his sleep went from him.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ noh, pơtao wih brŏk tơ hnam pơtao sư, ưh kơ sŏng sa, kư̆m ưh kơ đei iŏk lu brŏ reh 'bơ̆t anăp sư păng pơtao ưh kơ gơh tep."
"Then the king arose very early in the morning and went in haste to the den of lions.","Na, pơtao drôih iung đơ̆ng hrôih, sư hăt hot kơdâu năm tơ sơlŭng dăm-brang."
"And when he came to the den, he cried out with a lamenting voice to Daniel. The king spoke, saying to Daniel, “Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?”","Pơtao năm 'nao wă jê̆ sơlŭng dăm-brang, sư krao Đaniel hăm nơ̆r sơ'ngon pơtao pơma hăm Đaniel thoi âu: Ơ Đaniel, đĭch đam Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei mă arih ling-lang! Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ih, mă ih oei bơ̆jang Sư hăm pơklaih ih đơ̆ng 'bơ̆r dăm-brang ưh?"
"Then Daniel said to the king, “O king, live forever!","Na Đaniel khan kơ pơtao: Ơ pơtao hơpơi kơ ih arih ling-lang!"
"My God sent His angel and shut the lions’ mouths, so that they have not hurt me, because I was found innocent before Him; and also, O king, I have done no wrong before you.”","Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei inh đei wơh Linh jang Sư chĭt lê̆ 'bơ̆r lu dăm-brang, thoi ei na lu sư ưh kơ gơh pơrăm inh, yua kơ inh khan boih, inh ưh kơ đei pơm yoch kiơ 'bơ̆t anăp sư, ơ pơtao, mă hăm ih kư̆m lei-lăi inh ưh kơ đei pơm yoch kiơ."
"Now the king was exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no injury whatever was found on him, because he believed in his God.","Na, pơtao chhôk dêh păng athei đe hơtŏk Đaniel đơ̆ng lăm sơlŭng.

"And the king gave the command, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions—them, their children, and their wives; and the lions overpowered them, and broke all their bones in pieces before they ever came to the bottom of the den.","Kiơ̆ thoi pơtao đei athei, dôm lu bơngai đêl kêng Đaniel noh hăm lu kon akăn sư, athei đe klơ̆m lê̆ tơ lăm sơlŭng dăm-brang noh.

"Then King Darius wrote: To all peoples, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you.","Đơ̆ng noh, pơtao Đarius chih tơbăt ăn kơ đĭ-đăng kon pơlei pơla, tơ jơ̆p dêh char, tơ rim adrĕch, rim nơ̆r pơma kơpal teh thoi âu: Hơpơi kơ lu iĕm đei tơdrong pŭn hiôk rai dêh."
"I make a decree that in every dominion of my kingdom men must tremble and fear before the God of Daniel. For He is the living God, And steadfast forever; His kingdom is the one which shall not be destroyed, And His dominion shall endure to the end.","Inh chih tơbăt, ăn jơ̆p kơ lăm dêh char 'bôh, đĭ-đăng athei hli yom tơtơ̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei arih ling-lang hlŏng hloi, Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Đaniel teh đak Sư ưh kơ đei layơ hiong răm păng tơdrong mơsêh mơyang Sư oei oei ling-lang truh năr tôch."
"He delivers and rescues, And He works signs and wonders In heaven and on earth, Who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.","Sư boih mă dŏng pơklaih păng yaih achăng, pơm lơ tơdrong hlĭch păng chrơp tơ kơpal plĕnh ala teh dŏng pơklaih boih Đaniel đơ̆ng tơdrong pran kơtang dăm-brang."
"So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.","Đaniel đei tơdrong pŭn hiôk đĭ chăl arih sư kơplah oei pơtao Đarius păng pơtao Sirus bơngai Pherơsơ pơm pơtao."
"In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and visions of his head while on his bed. Then he wrote down the dream, telling the main facts.","Sơnăm blŭng-a chăl pơtao Belsatsar pơgơ̆r, teh đak Babilôn, Đaniel apo 'bôh păng đei 'bôh lăm tơdrong tơchĕng kơplah sư oei 'bĭch kơpal giơng sư. Na sư chih hloi dôm tơdrong apo noh păng roi tơblang lu tơdrong noh."
"Daniel spoke, saying, “I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the Great Sea.","Thoi noh, Đaniel khan: Kơmăng inh oei tep, inh apo 'bôh, lăm tơdrong tơ'bôh kơ inh thoi âu: Đei puăn tŏ trong kial tơthu bah kơpal đak Dơsĭ Tih."
"And four great beasts came up from the sea, each different from the other.","Đơ̆ng noh, đei puăn tŏ kon sem brem tih lĕch đơ̆ng đak; puăn tŏ kon sem brem 'nâu phara băl."
"The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings. I watched till its wings were plucked off; and it was lifted up from the earth and made to stand on two feet like a man, and a man’s heart was given to it.","Sem brem mă adrol noh hơbŏ thoi dăm-brang păng đei pơnăr sem kring; inh lăng pơnhen dĭng truh tơ pơnăr sư tơbuch, na đe dui hơtŏk sư đơ̆ng teh, sư iung dang dơ̆ng năm 'bar pah jơ̆ng thoi kon bơngai bơ̆n păng kư̆m ăn kơ sư đei jơhngơ̆m kon bơngai."
"“And suddenly another beast, a second, like a bear. It was raised up on one side, and had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. And they said thus to it: ‘Arise, devour much flesh!’","'Nâu sem brem mă 'bar, hơbŏ thoi chơgơu; sư dơ̆ng cheng minh pah akâu.

"“After this I looked, and there was another, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings of a bird. The beast also had four heads, and dominion was given to it.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ noh, inh lăng, đei 'bôh dơ̆ng kon sem brem plơ̆ng hơbŏ thoi djrang, tơ kơpal rŏng sư đei puăn tŏ pơnăr thoi pơnăr sem. Sem brem noh đei puăn tŏ kơ̆l păng ăn kơ sư gơh pơgơ̆r."
"“After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, exceedingly strong. It had huge iron teeth; it was devouring, breaking in pieces, and trampling the residue with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns.","Đơ̆ng rŏng inh lăng dơ̆ng mă tơdrong tơ'bôh kơ inh tơ kơmăng noh, 'nâu đei sem brem mă puăn, krưp dêh, kơtang tơpă păng đei jơhngơ̆m pran dêh tơpă.

"I was considering the horns, and there was another horn, a little one, coming up among them, before whom three of the first horns were plucked out by the roots. And there, in this horn, were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking pompous words.","Kơplah inh lăng lu hơke noh păng 'nâu đei minh pôm hơke plơ̆ng dơ̆ng chăt tŏk-bŏk lu hơke mă đêl chăt adrol hei păng đei pêng tŏ lu hơke chăt adrol tơgloh hloi 'bơ̆t anăp sư.

"“I watched till thrones were put in place, And the Ancient of Days was seated; His garment was white as snow, And the hair of His head was like pure wool. His throne was a fiery flame, Its wheels a burning fire","Inh oei lăng dĭng đe dan lu tang-dŏ pơtao păng đei kră mă oei arih đơ̆ng sơ̆ hơ-oei kơpal tang-dŏ noh.

"A fiery stream issued And came forth from before Him. A thousand thousands ministered to Him; Ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him. The court was seated, And the books were opened.","Đơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp sư, đei glung ŭnh ro tơ jơ̆p-jang; rơbâu hơngan linh jang awih awăn kơ sư păng rơbâu hơngan kon bơngai dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp sư. Tơdrong sek tơlang hơmet lê̆ boih păng đe kư̆m pơih lu sơ̆p hla bơar."
"“I watched then because of the sound of the pompous words which the horn was speaking; I watched till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed and given to the burning flame.","Dang ei inh lăng dơ̆ng yua kơ tơdrong pơrŏ pơang na mă lĕch nơ̆r pơma đơ̆ng hơke noh.

"As for the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away, yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.","Gah lu sem brem nai pă đei gơh pơgơ̆r boih Mă-lei ăn arih sot 'biơ̆ minh bơyan minh kơchon."
"“I was watching in the night visions, And behold, One like the Son of Man, Coming with the clouds of heaven! He came to the Ancient of Days, And they brought Him near before Him.","Inh kư̆m lăng dôm tơdrong inh đei apo 'bôh kơmăng noh.

"Then to Him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, That all peoples, nations, and languages should serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, Which shall not pass away, And His kingdom the one Which shall not be destroyed.","Sư đei tơdrong mơsêh, gơh kĕ, ư-ang păng đĭ dêh char, đĭ adrĕch kon bơngai, đĭ nơ̆r pơma awih awăn kơ Sư.

"“I, Daniel, was grieved in my spirit within my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.","Gah inh Đaniel, jơhngơ̆m inh ơh sơ'ngon lăm akâu inh păng dôm tơdrong inh đei 'bôh pơm kơ inh hơwơ̆l hơwang."
"I came near to one of those who stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me and made known to me the interpretation of these things","Inh năm dơ̆ng tơ jê̆ minh 'nu bơngai mă oei dơ̆ng tơ noh păng inh apinh Sư gah tơdrong 'nâu tơpă thoi yơ.

"‘Those great beasts, which are four, are four kings which arise out of the earth.","Puăn tŏ sem brem tih, wă khan puăn 'nu pơtao wă iung blah teh âu."
"But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever.’","Mă-lei lu 'bok 'lơ̆ng rơgoh đơ̆ng Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Tih hloh gô iŏk dêh char pơtao sư, dêh char noh oei oei ling-lang ưh pă đei tôch."
"“Then I wished to know the truth about the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, exceedingly dreadful, with its teeth of iron and its nails of bronze, which devoured, broke in pieces, and trampled the residue with its feet","Dang ei Inh wă tơbăt gah kon sem brem mă puăn, sem brem mă phara kơ kon sem brem nai, lăng krưp dêh hơnĕnh sư bơsei, kơchôp sư kong, sư kơkă pơhĕch păng luăn sa đĭ păng dôm tơmam kiơ kiơ mă oei oei sư pơjuă hăm jơ̆ng sư."
"and the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up, before which three fell, namely, that horn which had eyes and a mouth which spoke pompous words, whose appearance was greater than his fellows.","Inh kư̆m wă kơ băt sĭt gah mơjĭt tŏ hơke tơ kơ̆l sư păng đei pêng tŏ hơke mă tơgloh noh dơ̆ng.

"“I was watching; and the same horn was making war against the saints, and prevailing against them","Kơplah noh inh oei lăng hơke tơblah hăm lu 'Bok 'lơ̆ng rơgoh jei sư"
"until the Ancient of Days came, and a judgment was made in favor of the saints of the Most High, and the time came for the saints to possess the kingdom.","dĭng truh tơ 'Bok arih đơ̆ng sơ̆ jur ăn tơdrong sek tơlang kơ lu 'Bok 'lơ̆ng rơgoh Kră Yang Tih Hloh păng jơ 'năr truh kơplah lu 'Bok 'lơ̆ng rơgoh iŏk dêh char pơtao."
"“Thus he said: ‘The fourth beast shall be A fourth kingdom on earth, Which shall be different from all other kingdoms, And shall devour the whole earth, Trample it and break it in pieces.","Thoi ei na sư khan kơ inh: Sem brem mă puăn Sư gô pơjing dêh char mă puăn tơ kơpal teh, dêh char sư phara kơ Dêh char nai, yua kơ sư gô luăn pơđĭ teh đak, pơjuă păng pơrăm đĭ."
"The ten horns are ten kings Who shall arise from this kingdom. And another shall rise after them; He shall be different from the first ones, And shall subdue three kings.","Mơjĭt tŏ hơke wă khan mơjĭt 'nu pơtao gô iung lĕch đơ̆ng dêh char noh păng gô đei minh 'nu pơtao iung đơ̆ng rŏng, sư phara kơ lu pơtao adrol păng sư gơh blah pơchah pơrăm lê̆ pêng 'nu pơtao."
"He shall speak pompous words against the Most High, Shall persecute the saints of the Most High, And shall intend to change times and law. Then the saints shall be given into his hand For a time and times and half a time.","Pơtao noh sư gô blah pơma kơnê̆ kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Tih hloh, pơm kơ lu bơngai 'lơ̆ng rơgoh Kră Yang Tih Hloh rơdu rơmơ̆n păng sư pơkă wă tơplih khôi juăt, tơplih tơdrong pơgơ̆r, kơplah noh đe gô pơjao lu bơngai 'lơ̆ng rơgoh lăm ti sư minh sơnăm, 'bar sơnăm, minh puăt sơnăm."
"‘But the court shall be seated, And they shall take away his dominion, To consume and destroy it forever.","Mă-lei tơdrong sek tơlang gô truh păng đe gô iŏk lê̆ tơdrong pơgơ̆r đơ̆ng sư, wă pơrăm tơhiong tôch đĭ hloi."
"Then the kingdom and dominion, And the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, Shall be given to the people, the saints of the Most High.

"“This is the end of the account. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts greatly troubled me, and my countenance changed; but I kept the matter in my heart.”","dĭng dâu nơ̆r roi tơdrong tơ'bôh âu đĭ, gah inh Đaniel, tơdrong inh tơchĕng hơwơ̆l hơwang dêh. Muh măt inh jing dreng hơ'blă, mă-lei inh răk lăm đon inh dôm tơdrong noh."
"In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar a vision appeared to me—to me, Daniel—after the one that appeared to me the first time.","Sơnăm mă pêng lăm chăl pơtao Belsatsar, đei tơdrong tơ'bôh kơ inh, Đaniel, đơ̆ng rŏng kơ inh đei tơdrong tơ'bôh ki."
"I saw in the vision, and it so happened while I was looking, that I was in Shushan, the citadel, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision that I was by the River Ulai.","Thoi âu, lăm tơdrong đei 'bôh tơ'bôh kơ inh noh; inh 'bôh akâu inh oei lăm hnam pơtao Susơ, tơring Êlam; păng inh oei cheng glung Ulai."
"Then I lifted my eyes and saw, and there, standing beside the river, was a ram which had two horns, and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher one came up last.","Inh ngơk lăng 'bôh, đei minh pôm triu tơno đơ̆ng cheng glung, đei 'bar tŏ hơke, 'bar tŏ hơke sư kơjung, mă-lei đei minh pôm hơke kơjung hloh kơ hơke pah to păng hơke mă kơjung noh chăt đơ̆ng rŏng."
"I saw the ram pushing westward, northward, and southward, so that no animal could withstand him; nor was there any that could deliver from his hand, but he did according to his will and became great.","Kơplah noh inh 'bôh triu tơno năm tơ̆m hơnhaih tơ gah bơmơ̆t, gah yă-nơ̆m păng gah gơal.

"And as I was considering, suddenly a male goat came from the west, across the surface of the whole earth, without touching the ground; and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.","Kơplah inh oei tơchĕng lăng tơdrong noh, 'nâu đei dơ̆ng minh pôm bơbe bram truh đơ̆ng gah bơmơ̆t, yak năm tơ jơ̆p-jang kơ teh đak mă-lei jơ̆ng sư yak ưh kơ 'bơm teh; bơbe noh sư đei hơke chăt tih sơlam 'bar pah măt sư."
"Then he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing beside the river, and ran at him with furious power.","Sư năm truh tơ triu đei 'bar tŏ hơke, mă inh đei 'bôh sư dơ̆ng cheng glung; sư hơnganh hil dêh na kơdâu hloi tơ triu tơno noh na tơtơ̆m băl hloi hăm triu tơno noh."
"And I saw him confronting the ram; he was moved with rage against him, attacked the ram, and broke his two horns. There was no power in the ram to withstand him, but he cast him down to the ground and trampled him; and there was no one that could deliver the ram from his hand.","Inh 'bôh sư năm truh jê̆ tơ triu tơno noh, hil hơnganh na tơ̆m hloi triu noh, na hơke triu noh tơgơ̆ hloi 'bar pah; triu tơno noh ưh kơ kĕ kơ pơjăng, bơbe bram noh tơ̆m hơtơ̆k hloi triu tơno noh pơ̆k hloi tơ teh, bơbe bram noh hao pơjuă hloi păng ưh kơ bu kĕ pơ̆n kĕ dŏng pơklaih triu noh đơ̆ng tơdrong pran kơtang sư."
"Therefore the male goat grew very great; but when he became strong, the large horn was broken, and in place of it four notable ones came up toward the four winds of heaven.","Bơbe bram pơm kơ akâu sư rai tih; mă-lei lăp sư pran dêh boih, hơke sư mă tih noh tơgơ̆ păng tơ đêl anih hơke tơgơ̆ noh chăt dơ̆ng puăn tŏ hơke plơ̆ng, puăn tŏ hơke noh chăt pơdơ̆ng tơklă tơ puăn trong kial tơ plĕnh."
"And out of one of them came a little horn which grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the Glorious Land.","Yua kơ đei minh lăm lu hơke noh, chăt dơ̆ng minh pôm hơke iĕ, rai tih, rai tih jing kơjăp, gah gơal gah hơlĕch, tơklă tơ gah teh đak ư-ang."
"And it grew up to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and some of the stars to the ground, and trampled them.","Sư rai tih kơjung truh tơ khŭl linh tơ plĕnh; sư tơhuŏng linh tơ teh mơ'nah khŭl linh đơ̆ng sơnglŏng đơ̆ng noh sư pơjuă lê̆."
"He even exalted himself as high as the Prince of the host; and by him the daily sacrifices were taken away, and the place of His sanctuary was cast down.","Sư pơm akâu sư rai tih dĭng truh tơ yŏng pơgơ̆r linh; sư iŏk lê̆ tơmam pơyơ̆r đơ̆ng 'bok noh păng anih rơgoh sư tơhuŏng lê̆ tơ teh."
"Because of transgression, an army was given over to the horn to oppose the daily sacrifices; and he cast truth down to the ground. He did all this and prospered.","Yua kơ đei tơdrong yoch na lu linh jao pơđĭ kơ sư păng lu tơmam pơyơ̆r pơm tơmam 'buh păng tơjruh lê̆ tơdrong tơpăt tơ teh sư pơm kiơ̆ kơ sư kơdih wă na păng kĕ jei tih."
"Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said to that certain one who was speaking, “How long will the vision be, concerning the daily sacrifices and the transgression of desolation, the giving of both the sanctuary and the host to be trampled underfoot?”","Đơ̆ng noh inh kơtơ̆ng đei minh 'nu Yang rơgoh oei pơma păng minh 'nu Yang rơgoh nai dơ̆ng pơma dơnuh hăm Yang rơgoh mă oei pơma noh, thoi âu: Tơdrong tơ'bôh âu gah tơmam soi juăt kơ pơyơ̆r âu dang yơ gơh pơyơ̆r dơ̆ng păng gah tơdrong yoch mă đei tơdrong pơrăm, wă jao lu linh păng anih rơgoh wă pơjuă gơhlơ̆r hăm jơ̆ng, dĭng dang yơ đĭ?"
"And he said to me, “For two thousand three hundred days; then the sanctuary shall be cleansed.”","Inh kơtơ̆ng bơngai noh tơl inh thoi âu: Dĭng truh tơ 'bar-rơbâu pêng-hrĕng kơsơ̆ păng pơgê; đơ̆ng rŏng kơ noh anih rơgoh gô rơgoh đĭ."
"Then it happened, when I, Daniel, had seen the vision and was seeking the meaning, that suddenly there stood before me one having the appearance of a man.","Kơplah mă inh, Đaniel, lăng tơdrong tơ'bôh noh păng inh chơchă wă kơ băt nhen wă khan kiơ, 'nâu thoi đei minh 'nu drŏ-nglo dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp inh."
"And I heard a man’s voice between the banks of the Ulai, who called, and said, “Gabriel, make this man understand the vision.”","Inh kơtơ̆ng nơ̆r đơ̆ng bơngai drŏ-nglo noh dơ̆ng tŏk-bŏk glung Ulai, krao păng khan: Gabrel, roi tơbăt kơ bơngai âu mă đêl tơ'bôh kơ sư noh."
"So he came near where I stood, and when he came I was afraid and fell on my face; but he said to me, “Understand, son of man, that the vision refers to the time of the end.”","Sư năm jê̆ inh oei dơ̆ng, kơplah sư truh tơ inh, inh hli păng lăng krưp, na inh pơ̆k kơmŭ brum tơ teh.

"Now, as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep with my face to the ground; but he touched me, and stood me upright.","Kơplah Sư oei pơma hăm inh, inh tep hơlơ̆m hloi oei kơmŭ brum; mă-lei Sư hơtŭt kơ inh pơm kơ inh hơđơ̆r na iung."
"And he said, “Look, I am making known to you what shall happen in the latter time of the indignation; for at the appointed time the end shall be.","Bơngai noh khan kơ inh thoi âu: 'Nâu Inh gô roi ăn kơ ih băt tơdrong wă truh kơ năr tôch kơnh, tơdrong hil yua kơ tơdrong âu wă truh pơsĭt kơ năr tôch."
"The ram which you saw, having the two horns—they are the kings of Media and Persia.","Triu tơno mă ih đei 'bôh, đei 'bar tŏ hơke, noh bre pơtao Mêdi păng pơtao Pherơsơ."
"And the male goat is the kingdom of Greece. The large horn that is between its eyes is the first king.","Bơbe bram, noh pơtao dêh char Grĕk păng đei hơke chăt tŏk-bŏk sơlam măt wă khan pơtao blŭng-a."

"“And in the latter time of their kingdom, When the transgressors have reached their fullness, A king shall arise, Having fierce features, Who understands sinister schemes.","Truh kơ năr tôch kơ dêh char lu sư, tơdah lu bơngai kơnê̆ pơm tôm boih, na đei minh 'nu iung pơm pơtao, noh jơ̆ bơngai đei muh măt khĕnh nuih păng băt đĭ dôm tơdrong hlơp."

"And I, Daniel, fainted and was sick for days; afterward I arose and went about the king’s business.

"in the first year of his reign I, Daniel, understood by the books the number of the years specified by the word of the LORD through Jeremiah the prophet, that He would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.","lăm sơnăm blŭng-a sư pơgơ̆r dêh char sư, inh, Đaniel, dơ̆ng lăm sơ̆p hla bơar băt kơ dôm sơnăm mă nơ̆r Kră Yang đei khan kơ Jêrêmi bơngai yŏng khan lê̆ adrol, wă kơ 'blep trŏ kơ pơlei Jêrusalem gô juơ lăm tơpơh-jĭt sơnăm."

"And I prayed to the LORD my God, and made confession, and said, “O Lord, great and awesome God, who keeps His covenant and mercy with those who love Him, and with those who keep His commandments","Thoi noh, na inh krao khan kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei inh păng inh tơbral yoch inh hăm Sư.

"O Lord, righteousness belongs to You, but to us shame of face, as it is this day—to the men of Judah, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and all Israel, those near and those far off in all the countries to which You have driven them, because of the unfaithfulness which they have committed against You.","Ơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei, Ih 'lơ̆ng tơpă, gah nhôn đei tơdrong mơlâu, thoi năr âu; tơdrong noh gom lê̆ lu bơngai Juđa, kon pơlei Jêrusalem, kơ đĭ-đăng lu bơngai Isơrael oei jê̆, oei ataih, tơ lăm jơ̆p kơ teh đak mă Ih pơm ăn kơ lu sư tơklah tơklang, yua kơ tơdrong lu sư yoch hăm Ih."

"Yes, all Israel has transgressed Your law, and has departed so as not to obey Your voice; therefore the curse and the oath written in the Law of Moses the servant of God have been poured out on us, because we have sinned against Him.","Đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael pơm yoch boih kơ khôi juăt Ih păng jing ưh pă wă mơ̆ng nơ̆r Ih.

"And He has confirmed His words, which He spoke against us and against our judges who judged us, by bringing upon us a great disaster; for under the whole heaven such has never been done as what has been done to Jerusalem.","Ih pơsĭt kơ nơ̆r mă pơm tơwih kơ lu nhôn, kơ lu 'bok sek tơlang, đei sek tơlang boih kơ lu nhôn mă đei hlôi tơdrong răm truh kơ lu nhôn yua kơ jơ̆p teh đak tam mă đei tơdrong phak thoi noh, mă đei phak Jêrusalem."
"“As it is written in the Law of Moses, all this disaster has come upon us; yet we have not made our prayer before the LORD our God, that we might turn from our iniquities and understand Your truth.","Đĭ-đăng tơdrong răm âu truh tơ nhôn thoi đei chih boih tơ lăm khôi juăt Môis; lu nhôn kư̆m ưh kơ đei apinh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei nhôn, wă kơ lê̆ tơdrong kơnê̆ lu nhôn kơdih păng băt hlôh tơdrong lui kiơ̆ Ih."
"Therefore the LORD has kept the disaster in mind, and brought it upon us; for the LORD our God is righteous in all the works which He does, though we have not obeyed His voice.","Yua kơ tơdrong noh, Kră Yang lăng păng tơjur ăn tơdrong gleh noh tơ lu nhôn; yua kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu nhôn tơpăt lăm tơdrong Sư pơm, mă-lei lu nhôn ưh kơ mơ̆ng kiơ̆ nơ̆r Sư."
"And now, O Lord our God, who brought Your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and made Yourself a name, as it is this day—we have sinned, we have done wickedly!","Dang ei, ơ Kră Yang jơ̆ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu nhôn, Ih boih yua tơpang ti pran kơtang Ih chông anhăk lu nhôn lĕch hlôi đơ̆ng dêh Êyiptơ, anăn Ih đei ư-ang thoi âu năr âu.

"“O Lord, according to all Your righteousness, I pray, let Your anger and Your fury be turned away from Your city Jerusalem, Your holy mountain; because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Your people are a reproach to all those around us.","Ơ!

"Now therefore, our God, hear the prayer of Your servant, and his supplications, and for the Lord’s sake cause Your face to shine on Your sanctuary, which is desolate.","Thoi noh dang ei ơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu nhôn, apinh mơ̆ng bĕ, nơ̆r lu đĭch đam Ih krao apinh, yua kơ Ih, apinh pơdah bĕ muh măt Ih tơ anih rơgoh mă Ih đĭ juơ boih."
"O my God, incline Your ear and hear; open Your eyes and see our desolations, and the city which is called by Your name; for we do not present our supplications before You because of our righteous deeds, but because of Your great mercies.","Ơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei inh, apinh Ih pơgling đon păng mơ̆ng.

"Now while I was speaking, praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God","Inh oei pơma păng krao apinh, tơbral tơdrong yoch inh păng tơdrong yoch kon pơlei Isơrael inh păng inh pơyơ̆r nơ̆r krao apinh inh 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei inh, yua kơ kông rơgoh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei inh"

"At the beginning of your supplications the command went out, and I have come to tell you, for you are greatly beloved; therefore consider the matter, and understand the vision","Đơ̆ng kơplah ih pơtơm 'nao krao apinh; păng inh truh tơ âu inh wă tơbăt kơ ih tơdrong noh; yua kơ ih bơngai mă 'Bok Kei-Dei 'mêm mơnat dêh.

"“Seventy weeks are determined For your people and for your holy city, To finish the transgression, To make an end of sins, To make reconciliation for iniquity, To bring in everlasting righteousness, To seal up vision and prophecy, And to anoint the Most Holy.","Đei tơpơh-jĭt 'măng giĕng hơgăt kơ kon pơlei Ih hăm pơlei rơgoh tih Ih, wă găn tơdrong pơm glăi, hŭt lê̆ tơdrong yoch chhut rơgoh tơdrong kơnê̆ păng ba tơdrong tơpăt ling-lang hloi, wă pơsĭt anih tơdrong tơ'bôh păng nơ̆r khan lê̆ adrol păng tuh đak rơmă kơ Yang rơgoh hloh."
"“Know therefore and understand, That from the going forth of the command To restore and build Jerusalem Until Messiah the Prince, There shall be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks; The street shall be built again, and the wall, Even in troublesome times.","Ih athei băt păng hlôh tơdrong âu đơ̆ng năr mă athei pơjing păng hơmet ming Jêrusalem, dĭng truh Yang mă đei tuh đak rơmă, wă khan pơtao, na đei tơpơh 'măng giĕng păng tơdrâu-jĭt 'bar 'măng giĕng; pơlei tih đei pơdơ̆ng man ming, đei trong pơlei păng bơnang yua kơplah đei tơdrong anat anot."
"“And after the sixty-two weeks Messiah shall be cut off, but not for Himself; And the people of the prince who is to come Shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end of it shall be with a flood, And till the end of the war desolations are determined.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ tơdrâu-jĭt 'bar 'măng giĕng noh; Yang mă đe tuh đak rơmă noh đe gô pơrăm lê̆ păng pă đei kiơ dơ̆ng.

"Then he shall confirm a covenant with many for one week; But in the middle of the week He shall bring an end to sacrifice and offering. And on the wing of abominations shall be one who makes desolate, Even until the consummation, which is determined, Is poured out on the desolate.”","Sư pơjing tơdrong kơjăp hăm lơ bơngai lăm minh 'măng giĕng păng truh lăm tŏk-bŏk 'măng giĕng noh, Sư kư̆m ăn kơ tơmam soi 'buh pơyơ̆r kư̆m pơdơh.

"In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a message was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar. The message was true, but the appointed time was long; and he understood the message, and had understanding of the vision.","Lăm sơnăm mă pêng lăm chăl Sirus pơm pơtao dêh char Pherơsơ; đei minh tơdrong tơ'bôh ăn kơ Đaniel đe krao sư Beltơsatsar.

"In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three full weeks.","Lăm lu năr noh, inh Đaniel, oei sơ'ngon lăm pêng 'măng giĕng."
"I ate no pleasant food, no meat or wine came into my mouth, nor did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.","Inh ưh kơ sa tơmam 'lơ̆ng păng sik hơmu 'nhĕm kư̆m ưh kơ đei tah lăm 'bơ̆r inh păng inh kư̆m ưh kơ pik đak pơgang 'bâu phu dĭng đĭ pêng 'măng giĕng."
"Now on the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, that is, the Tigris","Năr mă 'bar-jĭt puăn khei mônh, inh oei cheng glung tih Hideke."
"I lifted my eyes and looked, and behold, a certain man clothed in linen, whose waist was girded with gold of Uphaz!","Inh bơyar măt inh păng lăng 'bôh, minh 'nu hrŭk ao che 'bui kok, tơ̆n tơlei tơ̆n păng maih rơgoh Upha."
"His body was like beryl, his face like the appearance of lightning, his eyes like torches of fire, his arms and feet like burnished bronze in color, and the sound of his words like the voice of a multitude.","Akâu sư thoi jơmŏng; muh măt sư kư̆m thoi kơmlat păng măt sư thoi pla ŭnh; jơ̆ng, ti sư rang thoi mam kong păng nơ̆r pơma sư thoi nơ̆r tơpôl bơngai lơ."
"And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, for the men who were with me did not see the vision; but a great terror fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves.","Inh, Đaniel, lăp minh 'nu inh đĕch lăng tơdrong tơ'bôh noh, yua kơ lu bơngai mă oei hơdai inh ưh kơ 'bôh ôh tơdrong tơ'bôh noh; mă-lei lu sư hli tơtơ̆ dêh, kơdâu ôn akâu lu sư."
"Therefore I was left alone when I saw this great vision, and no strength remained in me; for my vigor was turned to frailty in me, and I retained no strength.","Thoi noh oei pă minh 'nu inh păng inh 'bôh tơdrong tơ'bôh tih noh na inh pă đei jơhngơ̆m hloi.

"Yet I heard the sound of his words; and while I heard the sound of his words I was in a deep sleep on my face, with my face to the ground.","Đơ̆ng noh inh kơtơ̆ng lu nơ̆r sư, lăp inh kơtơ̆ng inh pơ̆k kơmŭ brum muh măt inh tơ teh na tep hloi."
"Suddenly, a hand touched me, which made me tremble on my knees and on the palms of my hands.","Đơ̆ng noh đei tơpang ti pel inh, na inh iung hơtơ̆p kŭl-tăng, tơjră ti tơ teh."
"And he said to me, “O Daniel, man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak to you, and stand upright, for I have now been sent to you.” While he was speaking this word to me, I stood trembling.","Đơ̆ng noh, bơngai noh khan kơ inh thoi âu: Ơ Đaniel, bơngai mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei 'mêm kơeng tơpă, ih athei băt hlôh bĕ nơ̆r mă inh đei pơma hăm ih.

"Then he said to me, “Do not fear, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart to understand, and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard; and I have come because of your words.","Đơ̆ng noh bơngai ei khan thoi âu; ơ Đaniel 'nĕ kơ hli; yua kơ đơ̆ng nơ̆r blŭng-a mă ih đei đon hlôh drap kơkuh 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ih păng lu nơ̆r ih pơma kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei kơtơ̆ng boih, yua kơ lu nơ̆r ih noh na inh truh tơ âu."
"But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days; and behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I had been left alone there with the kings of Persia.","Mă-lei pơtao dêh char Pherơsơ găn inh lăm 'bar-jĭt mônh năr; mă-lei, 'nâu, Mikael mă minh lăm lu Linh jang Tih hloh, đei truh păng tơgŭm inh boih păng inh oei tơ noh hăm lu pơtao Pherơsơ."
"Now I have come to make you understand what will happen to your people in the latter days, for the vision refers to many days yet to come.”","Dang ei inh truh tơ âu wă tơbăt kơ ih hlôh kơ tơdrong wă truh kơ kon pơlei ih lăm năr tôch kơnh; yua kơ tơdrong tơ'bôh 'nâu gô truh oei đunh năr đơ̆ng rŏng kơnh."
"When he had spoken such words to me, I turned my face toward the ground and became speechless.","Kơplah sư oei pơma hăm inh lu nơ̆r noh, inh kŭp kơ̆l tơ teh păng oei hreh."
"And suddenly, one having the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips; then I opened my mouth and spoke, saying to him who stood before me, “My lord, because of the vision my sorrows have overwhelmed me, and I have retained no strength.","'Nâu, đei minh 'nu hơbŏ sư thoi tơdăm kon bơngai năm pel 'bơ̆r inh.

"For how can this servant of my lord talk with you, my lord? As for me, no strength remains in me now, nor is any breath left in me.”","Thoi yơ inh âu đĭch đam Ih, mă gơh pơma hăm ih yŏng tơ'ngla inh?

"Then again, the one having the likeness of a man touched me and strengthened me.","Dang ei inh đei 'bôh dơ̆ng bơngai mă hơbŏ thoi bơngai drŏ-nglo tơdăm năm tơ inh păng pơm kơ inh đei jơhngơ̆m pran dơ̆ng."
"And he said, “O man greatly beloved, fear not! Peace be to you; be strong, yes, be strong!” So when he spoke to me I was strengthened, and said, “Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.”","Sư khan kơ inh thoi âu: Ơ bơngai mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei 'mêm, 'nĕ kơ hli; hơpơi kơ ih đei tơdrong pŭn hiôk oei hăm ih.

"Then he said, “Do you know why I have come to you? And now I must return to fight with the prince of Persia; and when I have gone forth, indeed the prince of Greece will come.","Sư khan kơ inh thoi âu: Ih hăm băt yua kơ kiơ inh năm tơ ih?

"But I will tell you what is noted in the Scripture of Truth. (No one upholds me against these, except Michael your prince.","Mă-lei inh khan kơ ih băt dôm tơdrong noh đei chih boih tơ lăm sơ̆p hla bơar tơdrong sĭt.

"“Also in the first year of Darius the Mede, I, even I, stood up to confirm and strengthen him.)","Lăm sơnăm blŭng-a chăl Đarius pơm pơtao bơngai Mêdi, inh iung wă tơgŭm sư jing pran. Nơ̆r khan lê̆ adrol gah pơtao Grĕk pơrăm dêh char Pherơsơ păng pơtao gah yă-nơ̆m hăm pơtao gah gơal tơblah băl."

"And at the end of some years they shall join forces, for the daughter of the king of the South shall go to the king of the North to make an agreement; but she shall not retain the power of her authority, and neither he nor his authority shall stand; but she shall be given up, with those who brought her, and with him who begot her, and with him who strengthened her in those times.","Dĭng truh tơ dôm sơnăm tuch-luch, lu pơtao noh pơpôi băl pôm đon; duch bia kon pơtao gah gơal năm tơ pơtao gah yă-nơ̆m wă tơguăt băl pôm đon mă-lei tơdrong pơtơm đơ̆ng ti duch bia kư̆m ưh kơ đunh, tơdrong pran kơtang đơ̆ng ti pơtao đơ̆ng gah yă-nơ̆m kư̆m pă đei; mă-lei duch bia hăm lu bơngai nai chông ba sư truh, hăm bơngai pơjing sư, hơdai hăm lu bơngai mă đei dŏng tơgŭm sư kơplah noh đe rôp đĭ."
