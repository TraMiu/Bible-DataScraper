"Now the word of the LORD came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying","Đei nơ̆r Kră Yang khan kơ Jôna kon drŏ-nglo Amitai thoi âu"
"“Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry out against it; for their wickedness has come up before Me.”","Ih iung bĕ! Năm tơ pơlei tih Niniwe, pơma khă lu sư, yua kơ tơdrong yoch lu sư tih kơtơ̆ng truh tơ Inh."
"But Jonah arose to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD. He went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tarshish; so he paid the fare, and went down into it, to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD.","Mă-lei Jôna kơdâu năm tơ pơlei Tarisi, wă klĕnh đơ̆ng anăp Kră Yang. Sư jur truh tơ pơlei Jôpa, tơ'bơ̆p duk năm tơ pơlei Tarisi, wă klĕnh đơ̆ng anăp Kră Yang."
"But the LORD sent out a great wind on the sea, and there was a mighty tempest on the sea, so that the ship was about to be broken up.","Mă-lei Kră Yang ăn đei kial hơbŭt tih tơ đak dơsĭ, duk mah wă jê̆ pơchah."
"Then the mariners were afraid; and every man cried out to his god, and threw the cargo that was in the ship into the sea, to lighten the load. But Jonah had gone down into the lowest parts of the ship, had lain down, and was fast asleep.","Lu bơngai wơ̆r duk păng lu bơngai jang lăm duk hli tơpă, rim 'nu bơngai hao lăm duk krao chă yang lu sư kơdih. Đơ̆ng noh, lu sư hŭt lê̆ đĭ tơmam đơ̆ng lăm duk tơ đak dơsĭ, wă kơ duk phiơl 'biơ̆. Mă-lei Jôna sư oei 'bĭch tep tơ anih ala lăm duk."
"So the captain came to him, and said to him, “What do you mean, sleeper? Arise, call on your God; perhaps your God will consider us, so that we may not perish.”","'Bok yŏng tơ'ngla duk noh năm tơ sư păng râu sư khan: Ơ bơngai oei tep noh, pơm kiơ thoi noh? Iung bĕ! Krao khan apinh yang ih bĕ! Wă kơ Yang ih 'blŏk kơ bơ̆n, na lu bơ̆n huay kơ lôch."
"And they said to one another, “Come, let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this trouble has come upon us.” So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ noh, lu sư pơma tơduă lu sư khan: Lu bơ̆n athei hlang lăng wă kơ băt tơdrong truh kơ bơ̆n âu, yua kơ đơ̆ng bu. Na lu sư hlang lăng trŏ kơ Jôna."
"Then they said to him, “Please tell us! For whose cause is this trouble upon us? What is your occupation? And where do you come from? What is your country? And of what people are you?”","Na lu sư apinh Jôna: Apinh ih athei roi ăn kơ lu nhôn băt yua kơ kiơ đei tơdrong truh kơ lu bơ̆n âu. Ih bơngai jang kiơ? Păng ih đơ̆ng yơ? Tơring ih oei tơ yơ? Ih bơngai kiơ?"
"So he said to them, “I am a Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.”","Sư tơl thoi âu: Inh bơngai Hêbrơ păng inh bơngai hli yom kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei kơpal plĕnh, Sư Tơ'ngla pơjing kơ plĕnh teh păng đak dơsĭ. Inh klĕnh đơ̆ng Sư."
"Then the men were exceedingly afraid, and said to him, “Why have you done this?” For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them.","Lu bơngai lăm duk đĭ-đăng lu sư hli păng khan kơ Jôna thoi âu: Liơ ih pơm thoi noh? Lu đe noh băt boih kơ sư bơngai kơdâu klĕnh đơ̆ng Kră Yang; kơtơ̆ng đơ̆ng sư roi."
"Then they said to him, “What shall we do to you that the sea may be calm for us?”—for the sea was growing more tempestuous.","Na lu sư khan: Lu bơ̆n pơm liơ wă kơ đak dơsĭ huay pă tơdrŏ, yua kơ đak dơsĭ poh-yă rai dêh."
"And he said to them, “Pick me up and throw me into the sea; then the sea will become calm for you. For I know that this great tempest is because of me.”","Jôna khan: Lu iĕm rôp klơ̆m lê̆ inh bĕ! Klơ̆m lê̆ tơ lăm đak dơsĭ, lei đak dơsĭ huay pă tơdrŏ. Inh băt boih yua kơ đơ̆ng inh na đei kial hơbŭt tih thoi âu"
"Nevertheless the men rowed hard to return to land, but they could not, for the sea continued to grow more tempestuous against them.","Lu sư adrin wơ̆r duk gơwĕch wă tŏk tơ kông ră, mă-lei ưh kơ kĕ, yua kơ đak dơsĭ poh-yă rai dêh pơm kơ lu sư."
"Therefore they cried out to the LORD and said, “We pray, O LORD, please do not let us perish for this man’s life, and do not charge us with innocent blood; for You, O LORD, have done as it pleased You.”","Lu sư krao khan kơ Kră Yang thoi âu: Ơ Kră Yang, lu nhôn apinh Ih 'nĕ ăn kơ lu nhôn lôch yua kơ bơngai âu, 'nĕ jô̆ kơ lu nhôn pơlôch bơngai âu. Ơ Kră Yang, yua kơ Ih boih Tơ'ngla pơm tơdrong kiơ kiơ̆ kơ Ih wă."
"So they picked up Jonah and threw him into the sea, and the sea ceased from its raging.","Đơ̆ng noh đe rôp Jôna klơ̆m hơtat lê̆ sư tơ lăm đak dơsĭ, na đak dơsĭ huay pă poh-yă hloi."
"Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice to the LORD and took vows.","Yua kơ thoi noh lu bơngai noh hli yom kơ Kră Yang lu sư pơyơ̆r tơmam soi ăn kơ Kră Yang păng pơkă hăm Kră Yang."
"Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.","Mă-lei Kră Yang hơmet lê̆ ka tih luăn Jôna. Jôna oei lăm klak ka pêng năr pêng măng."
"Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the fish’s belly.","Đơ̆ng lăm klak ka Jôna krao khan kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei."
"And he said: “I cried out to the LORD because of my affliction, And He answered me. “Out of the belly of Sheol I cried, And You heard my voice.","Sư khan: Năr inh tơ'bơ̆p tơdrong pơmat-tat inh krao khan kơ Kră Yang. Na sư đei tơl nơ̆r inh boih. Đơ̆ng lăm dêh atâu inh krao ôr, Sư kơtơ̆ng nơ̆r inh boih."
"For You cast me into the deep, Into the heart of the seas, And the floods surrounded me; All Your billows and Your waves passed over me.","Ih klơ̆m inh tơ tôch kơđĕl lăm đak dơsĭ jrŭ, đak poh-yă klơ̆p lôm ba inh. Đĭ-đăng dôm lu đak poh-yă đơ̆ng Ih klơ̆p kơpal inh."
"Then I said, ‘I have been cast out of Your sight; Yet I will look again toward Your holy temple.’","Inh đei khan thoi âu: Đe klơ̆m lê̆ inh đơ̆ng anăp Ih, mă-lei inh oei gơh 'bôh dơ̆ng hnam akŭm 'lơ̆ng rơgoh Ih."
"The waters surrounded me, even to my soul; The deep closed around me; Weeds were wrapped around my head.","Đak lơ̆p pơđĭ akâu păng Bơhngol inh. Hơlŭng dơsĭ jrŭ klơ̆p inh tăp dăr. Yă-yeng đak dơsĭ wăr tăp dăr kơ kơ̆l inh."
"I went down to the moorings of the mountains; The earth with its bars closed behind me forever; Yet You have brought up my life from the pit, O LORD, my God.","Inh jur truh tơ tôch jơ̆ng kông lăm đak dơsĭ, teh sư chơkăl găn lê̆ inh ling-lang. Ơ Kră Yang inh, mă-lei Ih hơtŏk boih tơdrong arih inh klaih đơ̆ng sơlŭng jrŭ."
"“When my soul fainted within me, I remembered the LORD; And my prayer went up to You, Into Your holy temple.","Kơplah inh wă lôch, na inh 'blŏk kơ Kră Yang, Păng nơ̆r inh krao khan truh boih tơ Ih; tơ anih rơgoh Ih"
"“Those who regard worthless idols Forsake their own Mercy.","Lu bơngai chă kơkuh kơ rup yang ưh kơ yua kiơ. Na achăng lê̆ tơdrong Kră Yang 'mêm kơ sư."
"But I will sacrifice to You With the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay what I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD.”","Mă-lei inh iŏk nơ̆r hơri bơnê păng iŏk tơmam soi pơyơ̆r kơ Ih; Inh gô pơkeh dôm nơ̆r inh mă đei pơkă boih. Tơdrong dŏng pơklaih đơ̆ng Kră Yang!"
"So the LORD spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land.","Kră Yang athei ka, na ka năm hăk lê̆ Jôna tơ jih đak dơsĭ."
"Now the word of the LORD came to Jonah the second time, saying","Đei dơ̆ng nơ̆r mă 'bar Kră Yang khan kơ Jôna thoi âu"
"“Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and preach to it the message that I tell you.”","Iung bĕ! Năm tơ pơlei tih Niniwe păng bơtho kơ lu sư nơ̆r mă Inh tơtă kơ ih."
"So Jonah arose and went to Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceedingly great city, a three-day journey in extent.","Na Jôna iung năm truh tơ pơlei Niniwe, kiơ̆ thoi nơ̆r Kră Yang đei tơtă. Kơplah noh pơlei Niniwe jơ̆ minh pôm pơlei tih, yak pêng năr kơ trong 'mơ̆i na hlôi."
"And Jonah began to enter the city on the first day’s walk. Then he cried out and said, “Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!”","Năr mă mônh Jôna pơtơm mơ̆t lăm pơlei, na bơtho khan: Oei pă puăn-jĭt năr dơ̆ng, Niniwe gô pơchah!"
"So the people of Nineveh believed God, proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest to the least of them.","Kon pơlei Niniwe lui kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei. Lu sư roi tơbăt athei hrŭk ao 'bi na ơ̆t kơ sŏng sa, iŏk đơ̆ng bơngai pơm tih yŏng mơng truh tơ lu kon pơlei hmă."
"Then word came to the king of Nineveh; and he arose from his throne and laid aside his robe, covered himself with sackcloth and sat in ashes.","Tơdrong noh kơtơ̆ng truh tơ pơtao oei lăm pơlei tih Niniwe, sư iung weh đơ̆ng anih pơtao sư, plôh lê̆ ao pơtao sư, na hrŭk ao 'bi hơ-oei lăm 'mui tơnuh."
"And he caused it to be proclaimed and published throughout Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything; do not let them eat, or drink water.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ noh pơtao roi tơbăt ăn kơ jơ̆p-jang pơlei Niniwe. 'Nâu nơ̆r pơtă đơ̆ng pơtao păng lu bơngai yŏng pơgơ̆r: Mă kon bơngai dah lu sem dơrong, rơmo dah triu, kư̆m ơ̆t ưh kơ sa kiơ. Ưh kơ ăn kơ lu sư sa, kư̆m ưh kơ nhă đak"
"But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily to God; yes, let every one turn from his evil way and from the violence that is in his hands.","mă-lei kon bơngai păng kon sem dơrong athei su 'bi. Rim 'nu athei adrin đĭ jơhngơ̆m krao apinh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei. Trŏ tơpă, rim 'nu athei achăng lê̆ trong kơnê̆, dah tơdrong kiơ mă pơm kơnê̆."
"Who can tell if God will turn and relent, and turn away from His fierce anger, so that we may not perish?","Bu băt, Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei gô tơplih đon tơchĕng sư, huay pă hil na bơ̆n gơh klaih đơ̆ng lôch?"
"Then God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God relented from the disaster that He had said He would bring upon them, and He did not do it.","Kơplah noh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei 'bôh tơdrong lu sư hŭt achăng lê̆ đĭ trong kơnê̆, Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei 'mêm mơnat ưh kơ pơrăm lu sư kiơ̆ thoi sư đei pơkă wă pơrăm."
"But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he became angry.","Kơplah noh Jôna sư ưh kơ lăp đon păng sư hil dêh."
"So he prayed to the LORD, and said, “Ah, LORD, was not this what I said when I was still in my country? Therefore I fled previously to Tarshish; for I know that You are a gracious and merciful God, slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness, One who relents from doing harm.","Sư krao khan kơ Kră Yang thoi âu: Ơ Kră Yang, noh hăm trŏ inh đei băt boih kơplah inh oei lăm dêh char nhôn sơ̆? Yua kơ noh na inh hăt hot kơdâu klĕnh tơ pơlei Tarisi. Yua kơ inh băt boih Ih jơ̆ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei iơ̆m dim, băt mơnat, hiơ̆ kơ hil, 'bĕnh hăm tơdrong 'mêm mơnat, ưh kơ wă pơrăm."
"Therefore now, O LORD, please take my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live!”","Ơ Kră Yang, dang ei, inh krao apinh Ih iŏk lê̆ tơdrong arih inh bĕ! Yua kơ gah inh, lôch 'lơ̆ng hloh kơ arih."
"Then the LORD said, “Is it right for you to be angry?”","Kră Yang tơl sư thoi âu: Ih blĕk hăm trŏ ưh?"
"So Jonah went out of the city and sat on the east side of the city. There he made himself a shelter and sat under it in the shade, till he might see what would become of the city.","Đơ̆ng noh Jôna lĕch đơ̆ng pơlei Niniwe, na năm pơm bơsŭn tơ gah hơlĕch pơlei noh na sư oei ngôi ala yơ̆p bơsŭn noh răp lăng tơdrong kiơ truh kơ pơlei noh."
"And the LORD God prepared a plant and made it come up over Jonah, that it might be shade for his head to deliver him from his misery. So Jonah was very grateful for the plant.","Đơ̆ng noh, Kră Yang ăn đei tơnơm hla hro kơpal bơsŭn Jôna, wă pơm yơ̆p kơ sư, wă kơ sư hiôk huay kơ tŏ, Jôna sư hiôk dêh yua kơ đei tơnơm noh hro."
"But as morning dawned the next day God prepared a worm, and it so damaged the plant that it withered.","Mă-lei năr đơ̆ng rŏng, lăp 'nao 'brưch gah hơlĕch, Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ăn kơnu kuer sa, na tơnơm hla hro noh jô lôch."
"And it happened, when the sun arose, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat on Jonah’s head, so that he grew faint. Then he wished death for himself, and said, “It is better for me to die than to live.”","Kơplah lăp 'năr lĕch, Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ăn kial tơthu dơ̆ng gah hơlĕch păng 'năr tŏ chră tơ kơ̆l sư, na sư mah wing măt, na sư khan thoi âu: Gah inh, lôch 'lơ̆ng hloh kơ arih!"
"Then God said to Jonah, “Is it right for you to be angry about the plant?” And he said, “It is right for me to be angry, even to death!”","Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei khan kơ Jôna thoi âu: Ih hăm trŏ kơ hil blĕk yua kơ tơnơm hla hro 'nâu? Sư tơl: Inh blĕk 'nâu trŏ, inh blĕk trŏ kơ lôch."
"But the LORD said, “You have had pity on the plant for which you have not labored, nor made it grow, which came up in a night and perished in a night.","Kră Yang khan dơ̆ng kơ sư: Ih lăng 'mêm kơ tơlei hla hro noh mă ih ưh kơ lap gleh kiơ minh tơdrong kơ tơlei noh; ih ưh kơ đei pơtăm, ih kư̆m ưh kơ bơwei sư, kơmăng 'bôh 'băi sư chăt lăm minh măng 'bôh sư lôch."
"And should I not pity Nineveh, that great city, in which are more than one hundred and twenty thousand persons who cannot discern between their right hand and their left—and much livestock?”","Na Inh ưh kơ 'mêm kơ pơlei Niniwe ôh hă, lăm noh đei hloh kơ minh-hrĕng 'bar-jĭt rơbâu kơ̆l kon bơngai ưh kơ băt ti gah 'ma liơ dah ti gah 'ngiĕo liơ păng kư̆m đei lơ sem dơrong hai?"
