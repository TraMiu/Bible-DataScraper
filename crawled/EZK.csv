"Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the River Chebar, that the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God.","Lăm sơnăm pêng-jĭt, năr pơđăm khei puăn, kơplah inh oei hơdai hăm lu bơnă tơ krong Kêbar, lu plĕnh tơpơih păng inh lăng đei tơdrong tơ'bôh đơ̆ng Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei."
"On the fifth day of the month, which was in the fifth year of King Jehoiachin’s captivity","Năr pơđăm khei noh lăm sơnăm mă pơđăm, đơ̆ng năr pơtao Jêhôiachin đe rôp."
"the word of the LORD came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the River Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was upon him there.","Kră Yang khan tơ'bôh kơ Êsêkiên, kon drŏ-nglo 'bok soi Busi, kơplah sư oei lăm char Kalđê jih đak krong Kêbar; tơ noh Kră Yang dan ti kơpal sư."
"Then I looked, and behold, a whirlwind was coming out of the north, a great cloud with raging fire engulfing itself; and brightness was all around it and radiating out of its midst like the color of amber, out of the midst of the fire.","Inh lăng 'bôh kial hơbŭt lĕch đơ̆ng gah yă-nơ̆m, đei hơmơ̆l tih dêh đei ŭnh hơdah jum dăr, păng tŏk-bŏk sư, inh 'bôh nhen thoi đei bơsei rang hơdah lăm ŭnh."
"Also from within it came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man.","Păng tŏk-bŏk ŭnh 'bôh puăn tŏ kon sem arih, hơbŏ rup thoi kon bơngai."
"Each one had four faces, and each one had four wings.","Rim kơ lu sư đei puăn tŏ muh măt păng puăn tŏ pơnăr."
"Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the soles of calves’ feet. They sparkled like the color of burnished bronze.","Jơ̆ng lu sư tơpăt, tơpang jơ̆ng thoi kơchôp kon rơmo, hơdah 'brŭng thoi kong rang rơgoh."
"The hands of a man were under their wings on their four sides; and each of the four had faces and wings.","Ala kơ pơnăr, puăn pah đei ti bơngai, rim tŏ kon sem đei puăn tŏ muh măt păng puăn tŏ pơnăr."
"Their wings touched one another. The creatures did not turn when they went, but each one went straight forward.","Pơnăr lu sư tơ'bưh dih băl. Rim kơ lu sư năm tơpăt anăp kiơ̆ kơ muh măt, akâu ưh kơ weh-woh."
"As for the likeness of their faces, each had the face of a man; each of the four had the face of a lion on the right side, each of the four had the face of an ox on the left side, and each of the four had the face of an eagle.","Muh măt lu sư thoi âu: Rim kơ lăm puăn tŏ noh đei muh măt thoi kon bơngai, rim lăm puăn tŏ noh đei muh măt dăm-brang gah 'ma; rim lăm puăn tŏ noh đei muh măt rơmo gah 'ngiĕo; păng rim lăm puăn tŏ noh đei muh măt sem klang."
"Thus were their faces. Their wings stretched upward; two wings of each one touched one another, and two covered their bodies.","Muh măt lu sư thoi noh. Pơnăr tưk kơjung rim lu sư đei 'bar 'bar hlak pơnăr lu sư bơyar tơ'bưh băl păng 'bar hlak pơnăr to pĕng akâu."
"And each one went straight forward; they went wherever the spirit wanted to go, and they did not turn when they went.","Rim kơ lu sem arih năm tơpăt tơ anăp kiơ̆ kơ Yang Bơhngol năm, mưh wă năm ưh kơ weh-woh ôh."
"As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches going back and forth among the living creatures. The fire was bright, and out of the fire went lightning.","Akâu lu kon sem arih noh nhen thoi ngar ŭnh khơ̆ng thoi hơchô̆ 'long ŭnh khơ̆ng năm rŏng anăp tŏk-bŏk lu kon sem arih noh; ŭnh hơdah păng đei kơmlat đơ̆ng ŭnh lĕch hơdah"
"And the living creatures ran back and forth, in appearance like a flash of lightning.","Lu kon sem arih noh năm wơ̆t wih rŏng anăp thoi kơmlat."
"Now as I looked at the living creatures, behold, a wheel was on the earth beside each living creature with its four faces.","Kơplah inh lăng lu kon sem arih noh, inh 'bôh đei tang-wang gre tơ teh cheng lu kon sem arih, tang-wang gre noh 'bơ̆t cheng rim kơ kon sem arih puăn tŏ muh măt."
"The appearance of the wheels and their workings was like the color of beryl, and all four had the same likeness. The appearance of their workings was, as it were, a wheel in the middle of a wheel.","Rup păng hơbŏ lu tang-wang gre nhen thoi tơmo rang; đĭ-đăng puăn tŏ tang-wang gre lei-lăi, rup păng hơbŏ thoi minh pôm tang-wang gre oei tơ lăm minh tang-wang gre nai."
"When they moved, they went toward any one of four directions; they did not turn aside when they went.","Mưh lu sư năm, puăn pah lu tang-wang dăr năm minh trong tơpăt noh ưh kơ weh tơ 'ma, tơ 'ngiĕo."
"As for their rims, they were so high they were awesome; and their rims were full of eyes, all around the four of them.","Gơwang tang-wang gre kơjung krưp tơpă; păng puăn tŏ gơwang tang-wang gre đei 'bĕnh kơ măt tăp dăr."
"When the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.","Lăp lu kon sem arih noh năm, lu tang-wang gre kư̆m năm hơdai 'bơ̆t cheng. Na mưh lu kon sem arih hiŏng tŏk tơ kơpal lu tang-wang kư̆m hơdai hiŏng tŏk kiơ̆ thoi noh."
"Wherever the spirit wanted to go, they went, because there the spirit went; and the wheels were lifted together with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.","Yang bơhngol wă năm tơ yơ, lu kon sem arih kư̆m năm tơ noh; păng lu tang-wang gre kư̆m hiŏng đơ̆ng teh năm kiơ̆ cheng, yua kơ yang bơhngol lu kon sem arih noh oei lăm tang-wang gre."
"When those went, these went; when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up together with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.","Lu kon sem arih năm, lu tang-wang gre kư̆m năm; lu kon sem arih dơ̆ng lu tang-wang gre kư̆m dơ̆ng păng lu kon sem arih hiŏng kơpal kơ teh lu tang-wang gre hiŏng hơdai, yua kơ yang bơhngol lu kon sem arih oei lăm tang-wang gre."
"The likeness of the firmament above the heads of the living creatures was like the color of an awesome crystal, stretched out over their heads.","Kơpal kơ kơ̆l lu kon sem arih, 'bôh đei gơwang tơ rơwơ̆ng nhen thoi getchai rang krưp, 'bĕnh ‘bang kơpal kơ kơ̆l lu sư."
"And under the firmament their wings spread out straight, one toward another. Each one had two which covered one side, and each one had two which covered the other side of the body.","Ala kơ gơwang noh, pơnăr lu sư bơyar tơpăt, lu pơnăr âu tơklă tơ pơnăr to, lu kon sem arih đei 'bar hlak pơnăr pĕng akâu gah âu păng gah to."
"When they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of many waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a tumult like the noise of an army; and when they stood still, they let down their wings.","Mưh lu kon sem arih wă năm, inh kơtơ̆ng pơnăr lu sư re thoi jơwa đak chơkơi, thoi nơ̆r đơ̆ng Kră Yang Tih Hloh; re ơ-ôs thoi lu linh lơ yak, Mưh pơdơh, lu sư tơjruh pơnăr."
"A voice came from above the firmament that was over their heads; whenever they stood, they let down their wings.","Đei nơ̆r pơma lĕch đơ̆ng kơpal gơwang tơ rơwơ̆ng kơpal kơ̆l lu kon sem arih. Mưh lu sư dơ̆ng pơnăr lu sư tơjruh."
"And above the firmament over their heads was the likeness of a throne, in appearance like a sapphire stone; on the likeness of the throne was a likeness with the appearance of a man high above it.","Kơpal gơwang tơ rơwơ̆ng kơpal kơ̆l lu kon sem arih đei rup kiơ noh nhen thoi tang-dŏ pơtao pơm păng tơmo rang; kơpal tang-dŏ noh đei rup hơbŏ thoi bơngai."
"Also from the appearance of His waist and upward I saw, as it were, the color of amber with the appearance of fire all around within it; and from the appearance of His waist and downward I saw, as it were, the appearance of fire with brightness all around.","Inh 'bôh đơ̆ng kơiĕng sư tơ kơpal hơdah thoi mam kong hlơ-hlŏng thoi ŭnh tăp dăr păng đơ̆ng kơiĕng tơ ala, inh 'bôh thoi ŭnh hơdah rang jum dăr kơ Sư."
"Like the appearance of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day, so was the appearance of the brightness all around it. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. So when I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of One speaking.","Inh 'bôh hơdah rang tăp dăr thoi plĕnh chro tơ hơmơ̆l wă 'mi. Tơdrong noh thoi 'lơ̆ng rŏ rang mơnhal Kră Yang. Lăp inh 'bôh inh kŭp muh măt tơ teh păng kơtơ̆ng nơ̆r minh 'nu pơma khan."
"And He said to me, “Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak to you.”","Kră Yang khan kơ inh: “Ơ kon bơngai, dơ̆ng bĕ 'bơ̆t jơ̆ng ih, Inh gô khan kơ ih."
"Then the Spirit entered me when He spoke to me, and set me on my feet; and I heard Him who spoke to me.","Lăp Sư pơma hăm inh, Yang Bơhngol mơ̆t lăm inh tơiung inh dơ̆ng hăm jơ̆ng inh, inh kơtơ̆ng Sư khan kơ inh.”"
"And He said to me: “Son of man, I am sending you to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have transgressed against Me to this very day.","Sư khan: “Ơ kon bơngai Inh wơh ih năm tơ adrĕch adrung Isơrael, truh tơ kon pơlei mă ayăt kơ Inh; lu sư păng lu yă 'bok lu sư pơm yoch ayăt hăm Inh mă truh dang ei"
"For they are impudent and stubborn children. I am sending you to them, and you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD.’","noh adrĕch adrung kơchu păng arăng kơ̆l, Inh wơh ih năm tơ lu sư, khan kơ lu sư: ‘Kră Yang Tih Hloh khan thoi âu:’"
"As for them, whether they hear or whether they refuse—for they are a rebellious house—yet they will know that a prophet has been among them.","Mă lu sư mơ̆ng dah ưh, yua kơ lu sư adrĕch adrung ayăt kơ Inh, lu sư kư̆m gô băt, lăm lu sư đei boih 'bok khan lê̆ adrol."
"“And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them nor be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you and you dwell among scorpions; do not be afraid of their words or dismayed by their looks, though they are a rebellious house.","Gah ih, ơ kon bơngai, 'nĕ kơ hli kơ lu sư păng kư̆m 'nĕ kơ hli nơ̆r lu sư pơma; 'nĕ kơ hli mă khan lu sư thoi jơla suĕng tăp dăr kơ ih păng mă ih oei tŏk-bŏk lu sư thoi hơguăt. 'Nĕ hli kơ nơ̆r lu sư pơma, kư̆m 'nĕ kơ hli tơrơ kơ muh măt krưp lu sư yua kơ lu sư adrĕch adrung ayăt."
"You shall speak My words to them, whether they hear or whether they refuse, for they are rebellious.","Ih athei khan nơ̆r Inh âu kơ lu sư, mă lu sư mơ̆ng dah ưh, yua kơ lu sư jing adrĕch adrung ayăt."
"But you, son of man, hear what I say to you. Do not be rebellious like that rebellious house; open your mouth and eat what I give you.”","Mă-lei ih, ơ kon bơngai, mơ̆ng bĕ Inh khan kơ ih; 'nĕ kơ ayăt thoi lu adrĕch adrung noh, ha bĕ 'bơ̆r ih păng sa tơdrong kiơ mă Inh ăn kơ ih.”"
"Now when I looked, there was a hand stretched out to me; and behold, a scroll of a book was in it.","Na inh lăng, inh 'bôh ti chro truh tơ inh; lăm ti đei minh sơnôm hla bơar."
"Then He spread it before me; and there was writing on the inside and on the outside, and written on it were lamentations and mourning and woe.","Sơnôm hla bơar noh bơlang 'bơ̆t anăp inh, đei chih, lăm păng đaih, noh đei chih lu tơdrong nhơ̆m hmoi ơh sơ'ngon păng tơdrong pơmat-tat."
"Moreover He said to me, “Son of man, eat what you find; eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.”","Sư khan kơ inh: “Ơ kon bơngai, sa bĕ tơmam mă ih 'bôh 'bơ̆t anăp; sa bĕ sơnôm hla bơar âu păng năm, khan kơ adrĕch Isơrael.”"
"So I opened my mouth, and He caused me to eat that scroll.","Na inh ha 'bơ̆r, Sư ăn kơ inh sa sơnôm hla bơar noh."
"And He said to me, “Son of man, feed your belly, and fill your stomach with this scroll that I give you.” So I ate, and it was in my mouth like honey in sweetness.","Na Sư khan kơ inh: “Ơ kon bơngai, iŏk sa bĕ sơnôm hla bơar Inh ăn kơ ih sa mă phĭ 'bĕnh kơ klak.” Thoi noh inh sa, 'băt 'ngam thoi đak sut lăm 'bơ̆r inh."
"Then He said to me: “Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak with My words to them.","Na Sư khan kơ inh: “Ơ kon bơngai, năm bĕ tơ adrĕch Isơrael, năm roi nơ̆r Inh kơ lu sư."
"For you are not sent to a people of unfamiliar speech and of hard language, but to the house of Israel","Ưh kơ sĭ Inh wơh ih năm tơ kon pơlei tơmoi mă pơma nơ̆r anat kơ hlôh ôh, mă-lei năm tơ adrĕch Isơrael."
"not to many people of unfamiliar speech and of hard language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely, had I sent you to them, they would have listened to you.","Ưh kơ sĭ Inh wơh ih năm tơ lu kon pơlei tơmoi wă pơma nơ̆r anat kơ hlôh, nơ̆r pơma lu sư noh ih ưh kơ hlôh ôh, tơpă tơdah Inh wơh ih truh tơ lu sư, lu sư gô mơ̆ng ih."
"But the house of Israel will not listen to you, because they will not listen to Me; for all the house of Israel are impudent and hard-hearted.","Adrĕch adrung Isơrael ưh kơ wă mơ̆ng ih, yua kơ lu sư kư̆m ưh kơ wă mơ̆ng Inh. Đĭ-đăng adrĕch adrung Isơrael ưh kơ chu, lu sư arăng kơ̆l."
"Behold, I have made your face strong against their faces, and your forehead strong against their foreheads.","Inh gô pơm kơ măt ih arăng kơ̆l thoi măt lu sư păng klĕng ih arăng thoi klĕng lu sư."
"Like adamant stone, harder than flint, I have made your forehead; do not be afraid of them, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.”","Inh gô pơm kơ kơ̆l ih arăng thoi jơmŏng, arăng hloh kơ tơmo. 'Nĕ hli kơ lu sư păng 'nĕ tơrơ, yua kơ 'bơ̆t anăp măt lu sư yua kơ lu sư jing adrĕch adrung ayăt kơ Inh.”"
"Moreover He said to me: “Son of man, receive into your heart all My words that I speak to you, and hear with your ears.","Sư khan dơ̆ng kơ inh: “Ơ kon bơngai, mơ̆ng bĕ mă nhen, iŏk bĕ lăm jơhngơ̆m dôm nơ̆r Inh pơma khan kơ ih."
"And go, get to the captives, to the children of your people, and speak to them and tell them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD,’ whether they hear, or whether they refuse.”","Năm bĕ tơ lu bơngai mă đe puh boih lăm lu kon pơlei ih pơm bơnă, khan kơ lu sư 'nâu nơ̆r Kră Yang Tih Hloh khan, mă lu sư mơ̆ng dah ưh.”"
"Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a great thunderous voice: “Blessed is the glory of the LORD from His place!”","Na Yang Bơhngol hơtŏk inh tơ kơpal păng inh kơtơ̆ng re jơwa tih tơ rŏng inh. Kơkuh bơnê ư-ang kơ Kră Yang lăm anih Sư oei."
"I also heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, and a great thunderous noise.","Inh kư̆m kơtơ̆ng re đơ̆ng pơnăr lu kon sem arih tơtuh hơtŭt băl păng re jơwa lu tang-wang gre rơ̆m răm 'bơ̆t cheng lu sư."
"So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.","Yang Bơhngol hơtŏk inh tơ kơpal păng anhăk inh năm, inh năm hăm jơhngơ̆m chhŭr nuih blĕk dêh tơpang ti Kră Yang kơtĭt kơpal inh trăp dêh."
"Then I came to the captives at Tel Abib, who dwelt by the River Chebar; and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.","Inh năm truh tơ anih lu bơngai đe pơpuh oei tơ pơlei Têlabip, jê̆ tơ đak krong Kêbar inh dơ̆ng lăm anih lu sư oei păng inh oei hơdai lu sư tơpơh năr hăm jơhngơ̆m sơ'ngon hơwơ̆l hơwang."
"Now it came to pass at the end of seven days that the word of the LORD came to me, saying","Hlôi kơ tơpơh năr đei nơ̆r Kră Yang khan kơ inh"
"“Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; therefore hear a word from My mouth, and give them warning from Me","“Ơ kon bơngai, Inh ăn kơ ih jing bơngai wei-lăng lu adrĕch Isơrael; mưh ih kơtơ̆ng nơ̆r Inh khan, ih athei năm roi tơbăt kơ lu sư nơ̆r mă Inh pơkă kơ lu sư athei kơchăng."
"When I say to the wicked, ‘You shall surely die,’ and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life, that same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand.","Layơ mă Inh khan kơ bơngai pơm kơnê̆! ‘Sĭt ih gô lôch,’ mă-lei ih ưh kơ khan tơbăt kơ sư păng ưh kơ pơma khă sư athei hŭt lê̆ tơdrong kơnê̆ wă kơ sư gơh arih, bơngai pơm kơnê̆ noh gô lôch lăm tơdrong yoch sư. Mă-lei Inh gô tơpŭ pham sư lăm tơpang ti ih."
"Yet, if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.","Mă-lei tơdah ih khă tơbăt boih kơ bơngai pơm kơnê̆ noh, dah lu sư ưh kơ hŭt lê̆ trong pơm kơnê̆ kơdih, lu sư gô lôch lăm tơdrong yoch lu sư kơdih, mă-lei ih gô klaih huay pă pŭ."
"“Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die; because you did not give him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood I will require at your hand.","Tơpă, dah minh 'nu bơngai tơpăt lê̆ tơdrong tơpăt sư na pơm yoch, Inh gô ăn đei tơdrong pơgăn 'bơ̆t anăp sư păng sư gô lôch yua kơ pơm yoch, mă-lei yua kơ ih ưh kơ khan khă bơngai noh, thoi noh sư gô lôch lăm tơdrong yoch sư, Inh ưh pă 'blŏk dôm tơdrong tơpăt mă sư đei pơm, mă-lei pham sư oei jô̆ lăm ti ih."
"Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man that the righteous should not sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live because he took warning; also you will have delivered your soul.”","Mă-lei tơdah ih đei khan tơbăt kơ bơngai tơpăt bơih, 'nĕ pă pơm yoch, sư ưh pă pơm yoch, na gô arih, yua kơtơ̆ng nơ̆r ih khă, lei ih gơh klaih huay kơ jô̆.”"
"Then the hand of the LORD was upon me there, and He said to me, “Arise, go out into the plain, and there I shall talk with you.”","Tơ noh ti Kră Yang dan kơpal inh, Kră Yang khan kơ inh: “Iung bĕ năm tơ teh thŭng dơnă Inh gô khan kơ ih tơ noh.”"
"So I arose and went out into the plain, and behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, like the glory which I saw by the River Chebar; and I fell on my face.","Na inh iung năm tơ teh thŭng dơnă; tơdrong ư-ang rang mơnhal Kră Yang oei tơ noh thoi ư-ang rang mơnhal mă inh đei 'bôh tơ đak krong Kêbar, păng inh kŭp muh măt tơ teh."
"Then the Spirit entered me and set me on my feet, and spoke with me and said to me: “Go, shut yourself inside your house.","Na Yang Bơhngol mơ̆t lăm inh tơiung inh dơ̆ng kơtă 'bơ̆t jơ̆ng inh, Kră Yang pơma hăm inh păng khan: “Năm mơ̆t lăm hnam, chĭt ih kơdih."
"And you, O son of man, surely they will put ropes on you and bind you with them, so that you cannot go out among them.","Ơ kon bơngai, âu, đe gô chô̆ ih hăm tơlei păng ih ưh pă gơh năm tơ lu sư dơ̆ng."
"I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth, so that you shall be mute and not be one to rebuke them, for they are a rebellious house.","Inh gô pơm kơ hơpiĕt ih klep tơ păk-'ngơk, ih gô kơmlo, ưh kơ gơh chrih kơ lu sư; lu sư jing bơngai ayăt."
"But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD.’ He who hears, let him hear; and he who refuses, let him refuse; for they are a rebellious house.","Mă-lei mưh Inh khan kơ ih, Inh pơih 'bơ̆r ih păng Ih gô khan kơ lu sư, Kră Yang tih hloh khan thoi âu: Bu mơ̆ng athei mơ̆ng bĕ, bu sơngah kuă kơ mơ̆ng, lê̆ sư sơngah yua kơ lu sư adrĕch adrung ayăt plơ̆."
"“You also, son of man, take a clay tablet and lay it before you, and portray on it a city, Jerusalem.","“Na ơ kon bơngai, iŏk minh hlak gŏch, dan gŏch noh 'bơ̆t anăp ih păng chhơ̆ rup pơlei Jêrusalem kơpal gŏch noh."
"Lay siege against it, build a siege wall against it, and heap up a mound against it; set camps against it also, and place battering rams against it all around.","Ih wang tăp pơlei noh; man pơdơ̆ng dur, pơm kơđông linh, blah pơlei noh păng dan tơroi tŭl dur jum dăr pơlei wă pơrăm sư."
"Moreover take for yourself an iron plate, and set it as an iron wall between you and the city. Set your face against it, and it shall be besieged, and you shall lay siege against it. This will be a sign to the house of Israel.","Ih iŏk minh hlak gŏ bơsei, pơdơ̆ng pơm thoi dur bơsei sơlam ih păng pơlei; na ih tơwih muh măt gah pơlei noh ih pơm thoi đe oei wang tăp kơ pơlei noh.

"“Lie also on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it. According to the number of the days that you lie on it, you shall bear their iniquity.","Klaih kơ noh, ih athei 'bĭch cheng gah 'ngiĕo păng Inh gô dan tơdrong yoch bơngai Isơrael tơ kơpal ih.

"For I have laid on you the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days; so you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.","Inh đei hơgăt kơ ih kơsô̆ năr dang ăi hăm kơsô̆ sơnăm tơdrong yoch lu sư, jing pêng-hrĕng tơsĭn-jĭt năr, ih gô pŭ tơdrong yoch bơngai Isơrael."
"And when you have completed them, lie again on your right side; then you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days. I have laid on you a day for each year.","Mưh lăm năr noh đĭ hlôi boih ih 'bĭch cheng gah 'ma păng pŭ iŏk tơdrong yoch bơngai Juđa, lăm puăn-jĭt năr, Inh hơgăt kơ ih minh năr thoi lăm minh sơnăm."
"“Therefore you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem; your arm shall be uncovered, and you shall prophesy against it.","Kơplah noh ih athei oei tơwih muh măt ih tơ gah tơdrong wang pơlei Jêrusalem; păng sơk ti hoh hăm nơ̆r khan lê̆ adrol wă blah plơ̆ sư."
"And surely I will restrain you so that you cannot turn from one side to another till you have ended the days of your siege.","Inh gô iŏk tơlei chô̆ ih, wă kơ ih ưh kơ gơh pơdăr gah to, gah âu, truh tơ đĭ năr ih wang pơlei."
"“Also take for yourself wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt; put them into one vessel, and make bread of them for yourself. During the number of days that you lie on your side, three hundred and ninety days, you shall eat it.","Iŏk 'ba mi, 'ba tơ'bâu, tơh, tơh dreng, trơwơ păng 'ba mi kiĕng, tah lê̆ lăm ge, hrâu pơm 'bĕng ih sa 'bĭch cheng hơdôm năr, ih gô sa 'bĕng noh hơdôm năr, ih gô sa 'bĕng noh lăm pêng-hrĕng tơsĭn-jĭt năr."

"And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house with the elders of Judah sitting before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell upon me there.","Lăm sơnăm tăl mă tơdrâu, năr pơđăm khei tơdrâu, kơplah inh oei hơ-oei lăm hnam, lu kră pơlei Juđa, oei 'bơ̆t anăp inh, tơpang ti Kră Yang tih hloh tơ'bôh kơ inh."
"Then I looked, and there was a likeness, like the appearance of fire—from the appearance of His waist and downward, fire; and from His waist and upward, like the appearance of brightness, like the color of amber.","Inh lăng 'bôh nhen hơbŏ thoi bơngai, đơ̆ng kơiĕng tơ ala thoi ŭnh, păng đơ̆ng kơiĕng tơ kơpal hơdah rang mơnhal thoi kong đe pơiel."
"He stretched out the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my hair; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven, and brought me in visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the north gate of the inner court, where the seat of the image of jealousy was, which provokes to jealousy.","Sư yơ̆r kiơ noh thoi tơpang ti, rôp sŏk tơ kơpal kơ̆l inh.

"And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the vision that I saw in the plain.","Păng inh 'bôh tơdrong rang mơnhal Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael tơ noh thoi inh đei 'bôh tơ anih thŭng dơnă."
"Then He said to me, “Son of man, lift your eyes now toward the north.” So I lifted my eyes toward the north, and there, north of the altar gate, was this image of jealousy in the entrance.","Na Sư khan kơ inh: “Ơ kon bơngai, ngơk măt lăng tơ gah yă-nơ̆m.” Na inh ngơk măt lăng tơ gah yă-nơ̆m, to tơ gah yă-nơ̆m 'măng jang chơnang soi đei rup yang areh 'bơ̆t trong mơ̆t."
"Furthermore He said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations that the house of Israel commits here, to make Me go far away from My sanctuary? Now turn again, you will see greater abominations.”","Na Sư khan kơ inh dơ̆ng: “Ơ kon bơngai, ih hăm 'bôh dôm tơdrong lu sư oei pơm, lu tơdrong krưp kơnê̆ 'mê̆-'mach tih dêh mă adrĕch Isơrael pơm wă puh Inh ataih đơ̆ng anih rơgoh Inh? Tơpă ih gô 'bôh lơ tơdrong krưp kơnê̆ tih hloh dơ̆ng.”"
"So He brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, there was a hole in the wall.","Na Sư ba inh tơ 'măng mơ̆t tơ cham, inh lăng 'bôh đei minh bơlôh tơ dur."
"Then He said to me, “Son of man, dig into the wall”; and when I dug into the wall, there was a door.","Sư khan kơ inh: “Ơ kon bơngai, bŏk dur đei bơlôh noh bĕ.” Inh bŏk dur noh na 'bôh minh pôm 'măng mơ̆t tơ noh."
"And He said to me, “Go in, and see the wicked abominations which they are doing there.”","Sư khan kơ inh: “Mơ̆t lăng bĕ lu tơdrong kơnê̆ krưp mă lu sư đei pơm tơ âu.”"
"So I went in and saw, and there—every sort of creeping thing, abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed all around on the walls.","Na inh mơ̆t lăng 'bôh tơ noh đei tôm kơ rup man kon sem krưp, kơep lep-ler, dôm rup yang man đơ̆ng adrĕch Isơrael đei chhơ̆ jum dăr kơ tơnăr dur."
"And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, and in their midst stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan. Each man had a censer in his hand, and a thick cloud of incense went up.","'Bơ̆t anăp rup inh 'bôh thoi đei tơpơh-jĭt 'nu kră pơlei adrĕch Isơrael oei dơ̆ng hơdai hăm Jaasania kon drŏ-nglo Saphan. Rim 'nu lu sư chĕp get pơgang 'bâu phu 'nhui pơgang 'bâu phu đông jơ̆p-jang."
"Then He said to me, “Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the room of his idols? For they say, ‘The LORD does not see us, the LORD has forsaken the land.’ ”","Sư khan kơ inh: “Ơ kon bơngai, ih hăm 'bôh tơdrong kơnê̆ lu kră pơlei adrĕch Isơrael pơm lăm măng mu ưh, rim 'nu lu sư lăm anih rup yang sư kơdih? Lu sư đei khan: ‘Kră Yang ưh kơ 'bôh lu bơ̆n ôh; Kră Yang achăng lê̆ boih teh đak âu.’ ”"
"And He said to me, “Turn again, and you will see greater abominations that they are doing.”","Sư khan dơ̆ng: “Ih gô 'bôh tơdrong krưp tih hloh phara kơ noh dơ̆ng mă lu sư oei pơm.”"
"So He brought me to the door of the north gate of the LORD’s house; and to my dismay, women were sitting there weeping for Tammuz.","Na Sư chông ba inh mơ̆t tơ hnam Kră Yang, rok 'măng jang gah yă-nơ̆m; tơ noh Inh 'bôh lu drŏ-kăn nhơ̆m hmoi kơ Tamus."
"Then He said to me, “Have you seen this, O son of man? Turn again, you will see greater abominations than these.”","Sư khan kơ inh: “Ơ kon bơngai, hăm 'bôh ưh? Ih gô 'bôh tơdrong krưp tih hloh kơ tơdrong 'nâu dơ̆ng”"
"So He brought me into the inner court of the LORD’s house; and there, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men with their backs toward the temple of the LORD and their faces toward the east, and they were worshiping the sun toward the east.","Na, Kră Yang Sư ba inh mơ̆t tơ cham hnam Kră Yang; păng tơ noh trong mơ̆t tơ hnam kơkuh kơ Kră Yang, tŏk-bŏk kơdeng 'măng păng chơnang soi, inh 'bôh đei dang 'bar-jĭt pơđăm 'nu bơngai drŏ-nglo, rŏng tơwih kơ hnam Kră Yang păng muh măt lu sư tơwih gah hơlĕch, drap kơkuh kơ măt 'năr đơ̆ng hơlĕch."
"And He said to me, “Have you seen this, O son of man? Is it a trivial thing to the house of Judah to commit the abominations which they commit here? For they have filled the land with violence; then they have returned to provoke Me to anger. Indeed they put the branch to their nose.","Sư khan kơ inh: “Ơ kon bơngai, ih hăm 'bôh ưh?

Âu, lăng bĕ lu sư tah 'long lăm trôm muh wă tơblĕk Inh!"
"Therefore I also will act in fury. My eye will not spare nor will I have pity; and though they cry in My ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them.”","Na Inh kư̆m gô blĕk areh dêh; măt Inh pă lăng mơnat kơ lu sư boih, mă lu sư krao ôr 'bĕnh kơ đon Inh, Inh kư̆m ưh pă mơ̆ng lu sư.”"
"Then He called out in my hearing with a loud voice, saying, “Let those who have charge over the city draw near, each with a deadly weapon in his hand.”","Inh kơtơ̆ng Kră Yang krao re 'bơ̆t đon inh khan kơ đe: “Năm jê̆ tơ âu bĕ lu iĕm mă wei-lăng pơlei, rim 'nu athei chĕp đao hơlă wă pơrăm đe.”"
"And suddenly six men came from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north, each with his battle-ax in his hand. One man among them was clothed with linen and had a writer’s inkhorn at his side. They went in and stood beside the bronze altar.","Inh 'bôh đei tơdrâu 'nu năm đơ̆ng gah 'măng kơpal tơ gah yă-nơ̆m.

"Now the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherub, where it had been, to the threshold of the temple. And He called to the man clothed with linen, who had the writer’s inkhorn at his side","Na tơdrong rang mơnhal Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael tŏk đơ̆ng chêrubim, đơ̆ng anih Sư oei, năm truh 'bơ̆t 'măng hnam akŭm.

"and the LORD said to him, “Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and cry over all the abominations that are done within it.”","na khan kơ sư: “Năm bĕ tơ jơ̆p lăm pơlei Jêrusalem, chih 'bơ̆t klĕng rim 'nu bơngai bu nhơ̆m hmoi kơ tơdrong yoch kơnê̆ krưp mă đei pơm boih lăm pơlei.”"
"To the others He said in my hearing, “Go after him through the city and kill; do not let your eye spare, nor have any pity.","Inh kơtơ̆ng Kră Yang khan kơ lu bơngai nai: “Athei năm kiơ̆ đơ̆ng rŏng bơngai noh, năm pơlôch jơ̆p pơlei, iĕm 'nĕ lăng mơnat."
"Utterly slay old and young men, maidens and little children and women; but do not come near anyone on whom is the mark; and begin at My sanctuary.” So they began with the elders who were before the temple.","Athei pơlôch đĭ lu kră, lu hơmuh hơmŏng, lu hơdruh, lu hơ'lơ̆p, lu drŏ-kăn, mă-lei 'nĕ kơ pơlôch lu bơngai bu mă đei chih 'bơ̆t klĕng sư.

"Then He said to them, “Defile the temple, and fill the courts with the slain. Go out!” And they went out and killed in the city.","Kră Yang khan kơ lu sư: “Pơm bĕ kơ hnam akŭm jing 'mê̆-'mach. Tuh tơ cham hnam akŭm 'bĕnh kơ bơngai lôch. Năm bĕ!” Na lu sư lĕch năm pơlôch đe lăm pơlei."
"So it was, that while they were killing them, I was left alone; and I fell on my face and cried out, and said, “Ah, Lord GOD! Will You destroy all the remnant of Israel in pouring out Your fury on Jerusalem?”","Kơplah lu sư năm pơlôch đe, inh oei minh 'nu. Inh bon muh măt tơ teh ôr krao: “Ơ Kră Yang Tih Hloh, Ih hil mĭl kơ pơlei Jêrusalem, Ih wă pơlôch đĭ lu kon pơlei Isơrael hă?”"
"Then He said to me, “The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great, and the land is full of bloodshed, and the city full of perversity; for they say, ‘The LORD has forsaken the land, and the LORD does not see!’","Kră Yang tơl inh: “Tơdrong yoch lăm adrĕch Isơrael păng Juđa tih dêh tơpă; teh 'bĕnh kơ pham pơlôch băl, lăm pơlei 'bĕnh kơ tơdrong kơnê̆ pơrăm băl. Lu sư khan: ‘Kră Yang achăng lê̆ boih teh âu, Kră Yang ưh kơ 'bôh.’"
"And as for Me also, My eye will neither spare, nor will I have pity, but I will recompense their deeds on their own head.”","Gah Inh, măt Inh lăng kư̆m pă mơnat păng Inh kư̆m pă đei lê̆ lu sư oei arih; Inh gô tuh tơ kơ̆l lu sư dôm tơdrong mă lu sư đei pơm.”"
"Just then, the man clothed with linen, who had the inkhorn at his side, reported back and said, “I have done as You commanded me.”","'Nâu bơngai hrŭk ao che 'bui, bĕng 'long chih đak mơ̆k, brŏk roi thoi âu: “Inh đei pơm kiơ̆ kơ nơ̆r Ih tơtă.”"
"And I looked, and there in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubim, there appeared something like a sapphire stone, having the appearance of the likeness of a throne.","Inh 'bôh tơ rơwơ̆ng mă tơ kơpal kơ̆l chêrubim đei kiơ noh rang nhen thoi tơmo gĭt lăng hơbŏ thoi tang-dŏ pơtao."
"Then He spoke to the man clothed with linen, and said, “Go in among the wheels, under the cherub, fill your hands with coals of fire from among the cherubim, and scatter them over the city.” And he went in as I watched.","Kră Yang khan kơ bơngai hrŭk ao che 'bui: “Mơ̆t bĕ tơ sơlam tang-wang gre ala kơ chêrubim iŏk ngar ŭnh 'bĕnh kơ tơpang ti ih, đơ̆ng sơlam lu chêrubim na săi jơ̆p kơ pơlei noh”. Bơngai noh mơ̆t tơm măt inh."
"Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the temple when the man went in, and the cloud filled the inner court.","Kơplah bơngai noh mơ̆t, lu chêrubim dơ̆ng gah gơal kơ hnam akŭm păng hơmơ̆l 'bĕnh kơ cham gah lăm."
"Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, and paused over the threshold of the temple; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD’s glory.","Na tơdrong ư-ang rang mơnhal Kră Yang tŏk đơ̆ng chêrubim, tơ anăp 'măng hnam akŭm tơm. Na hnam akŭm tơm 'bĕnh kơ hơmơ̆l păng tơ cham hnam 'bĕnh kơ tơdrong hơdah ư-ang rang mơnhal Kră Yang."
"And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even in the outer court, like the voice of Almighty God when He speaks.","Re jơwa đơ̆ng pơnăr chêrubim tơtuh đe kơtơ̆ng truh tơ cham 'nguaih, re thoi nơ̆r Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Tih Hloh pơma."
"Then it happened, when He commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, “Take fire from among the wheels, from among the cherubim,” that he went in and stood beside the wheels.","Kơplah Sư tơtă khan kơ bơngai hrŭk ao che 'bui: “Iŏk ŭnh đơ̆ng sơlam tang-wang gre lu chêrubim,” bơngai noh mơ̆t dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t cheng tang-wang gre."
"And the cherub stretched out his hand from among the cherubim to the fire that was among the cherubim, and took some of it and put it into the hands of the man clothed with linen, who took it and went out.","Minh pôm chêrubim chro ti iŏk ŭnh đơ̆ng tŏk-bŏk lu chêrubim, dan 'bơ̆t ti bơngai hrŭk ao che 'bui; bơngai âu iŏk đơ̆ng noh lĕch năm hloi."
"The cherubim appeared to have the form of a man’s hand under their wings.","Ala kơ pơnăr chêrubim, đei yă kiơ noh nhen thoi ti bơngai."
"And when I looked, there were four wheels by the cherubim, one wheel by one cherub and another wheel by each other cherub; the wheels appeared to have the color of a beryl stone.","Inh lăng, 'bôh đei puăn tŏ tang-wang gre dan cheng chêrubim, rim kơ minh pôm lăm lu tang-wang gre dan 'bơ̆t cheng rim kơ chêrubim; rup tang-wang gre noh hơbŏ rang thoi tơmo gĭt."
"As for their appearance, all four looked alike—as it were, a wheel in the middle of a wheel.","Rup tang-wang gre noh puăn tŏ lei-lăi, tang-wang gre âu tah tơ lăm tang-wang gre noh mă-lei dăr phara."
"When they went, they went toward any of their four directions; they did not turn aside when they went, but followed in the direction the head was facing. They did not turn aside when they went.","Dah lu sư wă năm lu sư năm kiơ̆ kơ minh lăm puăn pah, dah năm ưh kơ gơh pơdăr pơkuĕch tơ 'ma 'ngiĕo.

"And their whole body, with their back, their hands, their wings, and the wheels that the four had, were full of eyes all around.","Đĭ akâu lu chêrubim, rŏng, ti, pơnăr, tang-wang gre, lu tang-wang gre lăm puăn tŏ kon sem noh tă kơ đei măt tăp dăr."
"As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, “Wheel.”","Inh kơtơ̆ng đe krao. “Lu tang-wang gre pơdăr.”"
"Each one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub, the second face the face of a man, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.","Rim kơ chêrubim đei puăn tŏ muh măt; mă minh muh măt chêrubim, mă 'bar muh măt bơngai, mă pêng muh măt dăm-brang, mă puăn muh măt sem klang."
"And the cherubim were lifted up. This was the living creature I saw by the River Chebar.","Lu chêrubim păr tŏk. Noh lu kon sem arih mă inh đei 'bôh 'bơ̆t krong Kêbar."
"When the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also did not turn from beside them.","Mưh lu chêrubim năm, lu tang-wang gre kư̆m năm kiơ̆ cheng; mưh lu chêrubim bơyar pơnăr păr đơ̆ng teh tơ kơpal, lu tang-wang gre ưh kơ dăr weh đơ̆ng cheng lu sư ôh."
"When the cherubim stood still, the wheels stood still, and when one was lifted up, the other lifted itself up, for the spirit of the living creature was in them.","Tơdah kơplah lu chêrubim dơ̆ng, lu tang-wang gre kư̆m dơ̆ng; tơdah chêrubim iung păr, tang-wang gre kư̆m iung, yua kơ yang bơhngol kon sem arih noh oei lăm lu sư."
"Then the glory of the LORD departed from the threshold of the temple and stood over the cherubim.","Tơdrong ư-ang rang mơnhal Kră Yang lĕch đơ̆ng anăp 'măng hnam akŭm na dơ̆ng tơ kơpal lu chêrubim."
"And the cherubim lifted their wings and mounted up from the earth in my sight. When they went out, the wheels were beside them; and they stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD’s house, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them.","Lu chêrubim bơyar pơnăr păr tơ kơpal hloi đơ̆ng teh 'bơ̆t anăp inh; lu tang-wang gre kư̆m năm hơdai 'bơ̆t cheng lu sư.

"This is the living creature I saw under the God of Israel by the River Chebar, and I knew they were cherubim.","'Nâu lu kon sem arih mă inh 'bôh tơ ala kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael tơ krong Kêbar, păng inh băt tơpă noh lu chêrubim."
"Each one had four faces and each one four wings, and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.","Rim chêrubim đei puăn pah muh măt păng puăn pah pơnăr, ala kơ lu pơnăr đei hơbŏ thoi ti kon bơngai."
"And the likeness of their faces was the same as the faces which I had seen by the River Chebar, their appearance and their persons. They each went straight forward.","Muh măt lu sư noh jơ̆ muh măt mă inh đei 'bôh tơ krong Kêbar. Rim kơ kon sem arih noh năm tơpăt tơ anăp."
"Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the East Gate of the LORD’s house, which faces eastward; and there at the door of the gate were twenty-five men, among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.","Yang Bơhngol hơtŏk inh tơ kơpal păng 'nhăk ba inh tơ 'măng jang hnam Kră Yang gah hơlĕch.

"And He said to me: “Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity and give wicked counsel in this city","Kră Yang khan kơ inh: “Ơ kon bơngai, noh lu bơngai pơđâu pơm tơdrong yoch, chă đon pơm kơnê̆ păng pơđâu kơnê̆ kơ bơngai lăm pơlei 'nâu."
"who say, ‘The time is not near to build houses; this city is the caldron, and we are the meat.’","Lu sư khan: ‘Dang ei trŏ kơ man hnam. Pơlei âu jing gŏ 'bŭng, lu bơ̆n jing thoi 'nhĕm sĕch.’"
"Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man!”","Thoi noh khan lê̆ adrol bĕ wă blah lu sư, ơ kon bơngai khan lê̆ adrol bĕ.”"
"Then the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said to me, “Speak! ‘Thus says the LORD: “Thus you have said, O house of Israel; for I know the things that come into your mind.","Đei Yang Bơhngol Kră Yang jur tơ inh.

"You have multiplied your slain in this city, and you have filled its streets with the slain.”","Lu iĕm đei pơlôch lơ bơngai boih lăm pơlei âu, tơ rok trong lăm pơlei 'bĕnh lơ bơngai lôch."
"Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: “Your slain whom you have laid in its midst, they are the meat, and this city is the caldron; but I shall bring you out of the midst of it.","Thoi ei na Kră Yang Tih Hloh khan thoi âu: Lu akâu bơngai lôch mă lu iĕm hŭt lê̆ lăm pơlei âu jing 'nhĕm păng pơlei jing gŏ 'bŭng; mă-lei lu iĕm Inh gô pơpuh lê̆ tơ 'nguaih kơ pơlei."
"You have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you,” says the Lord GOD.","Lu iĕm hli kơ đao hơlă, na Inh gô ăn đao hơlă blah lu iĕm, Kră Yang Tih Hloh khan thoi noh."
"“And I will bring you out of its midst, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and execute judgments on you.","Inh gô pơpuh lê̆ lu iĕm lĕch đơ̆ng pơlei âu, gô pơjao lu iĕm lăm tơpang ti lu bơngai tơmoi păng sek phak lu iĕm."
"You shall fall by the sword. I will judge you at the border of Israel. Then you shall know that I am the LORD.","Lu iĕm gô pơ̆k lôch yua kơ đao; Inh gô sek tơlang phak lu iĕm tơ hơdral char Isơrael. Lu iĕm gô băt Inh boih Kră Yang."
"This city shall not be your caldron, nor shall you be the meat in its midst. I will judge you at the border of Israel.","Pơlei âu ưh kơ sĭ kơ gŏ lu iĕm; lu iĕm kư̆m ưh kơ sĭ 'nhĕm lăm noh; Inh gô sek tơlang lu iĕm 'bơ̆t hơdral char Isơrael."
"And you shall know that I am the LORD; for you have not walked in My statutes nor executed My judgments, but have done according to the customs of the Gentiles which are all around you.” ’ ”","Na lu iĕm gô băt Inh boih Kră Yang, yua kơ lu iĕm ưh kơ kiơ̆ khôi juăt Inh, ưh kơ wei răk tơdrong Inh tơtă, mă-lei pơm kiơ̆ tơdrong juăt teh đak jum dăr kơ iĕm.”"
"Now it happened, while I was prophesying, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell on my face and cried with a loud voice, and said, “Ah, Lord GOD!

"Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying","Nơ̆r âu truh tơ inh đơ̆ng Kră Yang"
"“Son of man, your brethren, your relatives, your countrymen, and all the house of Israel in its entirety, are those about whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, ‘Get far away from the LORD; this land has been given to us as a possession.’","“Ơ kon bơngai, kon pơlei Jêrusalem khan boih gah lu 'nhŏng oh ih, noh 'nhŏng oh ih kơdih, adrĕch adrung ih păng đĭ-đăng lu adrĕch Isơrael mă oei bơnă đe: ‘Lu sư ataih đơ̆ng Kră Yang; teh âu Sư ăn boih kơ bơ̆n bơ̆jang sa.’"

"For anyone of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who dwell in Israel, who separates himself from Me and sets up his idols in his heart and puts before him what causes him to stumble into iniquity, then comes to a prophet to inquire of him concerning Me, I the LORD will answer him by Myself.","Khan kơ đĭ-đăng lu bơngai lăm adrĕch Isơrael păng đĭ-đăng tơmoi mă oei lăm Isơrael: Bơngai bu mă weh ataih đơ̆ng Inh, mă oei 'măn rup yang lăm jơhngơ̆m păng dan 'bơ̆t anăp lu sư tơdrong kơnê̆ yoch, wă pơm kơ đe kơtơih pơ̆k, na năm tơ'bơ̆p bơngai khan lê̆ adrol wă krao apinh Inh, Inh boih Kră Yang gô tơl tơwih kơ sư."
"I will set My face against that man and make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of My people. Then you shall know that I am the LORD.","Inh gô blah plơ̆ bơngai noh, wă pơm kơ sư jing tơdra, minh tơdrong wă kơ đe đei nơ̆r hơmoch. Inh gô pơpuh lê̆ lu sư đơ̆ng kon pơlei Inh. Na lu iĕm gô băt Inh boih Kră Yang."
"“And if the prophet is induced to speak anything, I the LORD have induced that prophet, and I will stretch out My hand against him and destroy him from among My people Israel.","“Tơdah đe pơhlŭ bơngai khan lê̆ adrol na sư khan lê̆ adrol pơma minh nơ̆r ayơ noh, Inh boih Kră Yang lê̆ kơ đe pơhlŭ bơngai khan lê̆ adrol noh, păng Inh gô yơ̆r ti pơm plơ̆ kơ sư păng pơlôch pơrăm lê̆ sư đơ̆ng lăm kon pơlei Isơrael Inh."
"And they shall bear their iniquity; the punishment of the prophet shall be the same as the punishment of the one who inquired","Lu sư mă pơhlŭ bơngai khan lê̆ adrol gô pŭ tơdrong phak lu sư kơdih; Inh phak bơngai khan lê̆ adrol lei-lăi kơ phak bơngai pơhlŭ."
"that the house of Israel may no longer stray from Me, nor be profaned anymore with all their transgressions, but that they may be My people and I may be their God,“ says the Lord GOD.’ ”","Thoi noh adrĕch Isơrael huay pă jrok weh ataih đơ̆ng Inh păng huay pă pơm kơnê̆ 'mê̆-'mach kơdih hăm lơ tơdrong glăi nai dơ̆ng, na lu sư jing kon pơlei pơla Inh, păng Inh jing Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu sư, Kră Yang Tih Hloh khan thoi noh.’”"
"The word of the LORD came again to me, saying","Đei nơ̆r Kră Yang khan kơ inh."
"“Son of man, when a land sins against Me by persistent unfaithfulness, I will stretch out My hand against it; I will cut off its supply of bread, send famine on it, and cut off man and beast from it.","“Ơ kon bơngai dah char ayơ pơm yoch hăm Inh, ưh kơ tơnăp tơnen hăm Inh, Inh yơ̆r ti phak lu sư pơrăm lê̆ hnam mong tơmam lu sư, ăn tơdrong pơngot rơwĕt truh păng pơlôch đĭ bơngai hăm sem dơrong lu sư."
"Even if these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would deliver only themselves by their righteousness,” says the Lord GOD.","Dah mă đei pêng 'nu drŏ-nglo âu: Nôê, Đaniel, hăm Jop oei lăm char ei, lei lăp lu sư đĕch gơh klaih oei arih, yua kơ tơdrong tơpăt lu sư kơdih.

"“If I cause wild beasts to pass through the land, and they empty it, and make it so desolate that no man may pass through because of the beasts","Dah Inh ăn lu sem bri năm pơrăm char noh, pơlôch lu bơngai; păng char noh jing juơ, ưh pă đei bu yak rok noh dơ̆ng, yua kơ lu sem bri oei tơ noh."
"even though these three men were in it, as I live,” says the Lord GOD, “they would deliver neither sons nor daughters; only they would be delivered, and the land would be desolate.","Kră Yang Tih Hloh khan, tơpă thoi Inh mă arih ling-lang, mă khan đei pêng 'nu drŏ-nglo noh oei lăm char noh, lu sư ưh kơ gơh pơklaih kon drŏ-nglo dah kon drŏ-kăn, lăp gơh pơklaih kơdih akâu lu sư đĕch; char noh jing bri juơ tơtŭng."
"“Or if I bring a sword on that land, and say, ‘Sword, go through the land,’ and I cut off man and beast from it","Dah mă Inh ăn đei tơdrong tơblah hăm char noh păng khan: ‘Athei ăn kơ đe iŏk đao hơlă tơblah lăm char’ păng pơlôch pơrăm đĭ kon bơngai păng lu sem dơrong"
"even though these three men were in it, as I live,” says the Lord GOD, “they would deliver neither sons nor daughters, but only they themselves would be delivered.","Kră Yang Tih Hloh khan tơpă thoi Inh mă arih ling-lang, mă khan đei pêng 'nu drŏ-nglo noh oei lăm char noh, lu sư ưh kơ gơh pơklaih kon drŏ-nglo dah kon drŏ-kăn lu sư ôh, lu sư lăp gơh pơklaih kơdih akâu sư đĕch."
"“Or if I send a pestilence into that land and pour out My fury on it in blood, and cut off from it man and beast","Dah Inh ăn tơdrong lôch hơbuh truh lăm char noh, Inh tuh tơdrong hil hăm pham lĕch, wă pơlôch pơrăm đĭ bơngai hăm lu sem dơrong"
"even though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live,” says the Lord GOD, “they would deliver neither son nor daughter; they would deliver only themselves by their righteousness.”","Kră Yang Tih Hloh khan, tơpă thoi mă Inh arih ling-lang, mă khan đei Nôê, Đaniel hăm Jop oei lăm char noh, lu sư kư̆m ưh kơ gơh pơklaih kon drŏ-nglo dah kon drŏ-kăn lu sư ôh, lu sư lăp gơh pơklaih kơdih akâu sư đĕch yua kơ tơdrong tơpăt lu sư kơdih."
"For thus says the Lord GOD: “How much more it shall be when I send My four severe judgments on Jerusalem—the sword and famine and wild beasts and pestilence—to cut off man and beast from it?","Kră Yang Tih Hloh khan thoi âu: “Rai krưp kơnê̆ hloh dơ̆ng mưh Inh ăn puăn tơdrong sek tơlang trăp; tơdrong đao hơlă tơblah, tơdrong pơngot rơwĕt, tơdrong sem bri pơrăm păng tơdrong lôch hơbuh truh tơ Jêrusalem wă pơlôch đĭ bơngai păng sem dơrong."
"Yet behold, there shall be left in it a remnant who will be brought out, both sons and daughters; surely they will come out to you, and you will see their ways and their doings. Then you will be comforted concerning the disaster that I have brought upon Jerusalem, all that I have brought upon it.","Mă-lei đei lu bơngai mơ'nah klaih oei arih, lu kon drŏ-nglo hăm kon drŏ-kăn lu sư mă Inh gô chông lĕch đơ̆ng noh.

"And they will comfort you, when you see their ways and their doings; and you shall know that I have done nothing without cause that I have done in it,” says the Lord GOD.","Lu sư gô pơlung ih, ih gô 'bôh tôm tơdrong arih sa lu sư, ih gô băt tôm tơdrong Inh hlôi pơm hăm lu sư ưh kơ sĭ tơdrong kơđei ôh mă Inh đei pơm boih hăm lu sư.

"Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying","Đei nơ̆r Kră Yang khan kơ inh"
"“Son of man, how is the wood of the vine better than any other wood, the vine branch which is among the trees of the forest?","“Ơ kon bơngai, 'long hơmu sư hăm yua hloh kơ lu dơng tơ'bla 'long nai tơ lăm bri ưh?"
"Is wood taken from it to make any object? Or can men make a peg from it to hang any vessel on?","Đe hăm gơh yua 'long noh wă pơm kiơ? Hăm wă gơh yua pơm 'long hơtol tơ'băk tơmam?"
"Instead, it is thrown into the fire for fuel; the fire devours both ends of it, and its middle is burned. Is it useful for any work?","Tơdah đe iŏk klơ̆m lăm ŭnh pơm 'long ŭnh, dah ŭnh sa 'bar pah tơm kơnhŏng, tŏk-bŏk sư jing ngar, hăm gơh yua pơm kiơ dơ̆ng?"
"Indeed, when it was whole, no object could be made from it. How much less will it be useful for any work when the fire has devoured it, and it is burned?","Tơdah ŭnh ưh tam mă sa sư oei 'lơ̆ng kư̆m ưh kơ đei gơh yua pơm kiơ; tơma khan ŭnh hloh sa boih, đĭ jing ngar rơnok wă gơh yua pơm kiơ dơ̆ng?”"
"“Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: ‘Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so I will give up the inhabitants of Jerusalem","Na Kră Yang Tih Hloh khan: Thoi Inh đei iŏk 'long hơmu đơ̆ng lăm bri pơm 'long ŭnh tơkuh, Inh kư̆m gô pơm kơ kon pơlei Jêrusalem thoi noh."
"and I will set My face against them. They will go out from one fire, but another fire shall devour them. Then you shall know that I am the LORD, when I set My face against them.","Inh gô tơwih muh măt blah plơ̆ lu sư, mă khan lu sư klaih dơ̆ng ŭnh boih ră, ŭnh gô sa lu sư; na lu sư gô băt Inh boih Kră Yang."
"Thus I will make the land desolate, because they have persisted in unfaithfulness,’ says the Lord GOD.”","Inh gô ăn kơ char âu jing juơ rơhiăng, yua kơ lu sư pơm yoch ưh kơ wă chu, Kră Yang Tih Hloh khan thoi noh.”"
"Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying","Đei nơ̆r Kră Yang khan kơ inh"
"“Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations","“Ơ kon bơngai, athei tơbăt kơ Jêrusalem tơdrong lu sư pơm kơnê̆ krưp."
"and say, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD to Jerusalem: “Your birth and your nativity are from the land of Canaan; your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite.","Kră Yang Tih Hloh khan: ‘Khan bĕ kơ Jêrusalem thoi âu: Anih tơm rơh tơpŭ kơ ih đơ̆ng dêh char Kanaan, 'bă ih bơngai Amôrit, mĕ ih bơngai Hêtit."
"As for your nativity, on the day you were born your navel cord was not cut, nor were you washed in water to cleanse you; you were not rubbed with salt nor wrapped in swaddling cloths.","Tơdrong tơpŭ kơ ih thoi âu, lăm năr 'nao tơpŭ kơ ih, tơlei klŏk ih tam mă kăt, tam mă tơhum ih rơgoh, tam mă pung lơlĭ hăm 'boh, tam mă pôn hăm che."
"No eye pitied you, to do any of these things for you, to have compassion on you; but you were thrown out into the open field, when you yourself were loathed on the day you were born.","Ưh kơ đei bu lăng păng mơnat kơ ih, pơm tôm tơdrong noh kơ ih; đe klơ̆m tŭk ih tơ 'nguaih bri brah, yua kơ lăng ih krưp dêh năr 'nao tơpŭ kơ ih."
"“And when I passed by you and saw you struggling in your own blood, I said to you in your blood, ‘Live!’ Yes, I said to you in your blood, ‘Live!’","Inh năm rok noh 'bôh ih pơpơ̆ lăm pham ih; Inh khan kơ ih mă oei lăm pham, “Arih bĕ!” Tơpă Inh khan kơ ih “mă oei lăm pham, “Arih bĕ.”"
"I made you thrive like a plant in the field; and you grew, matured, and became very beautiful. Your breasts were formed, your hair grew, but you were naked and bare.","Inh ăn kơ ih wơ̆ tih thoi 'long lăm mir, wơ̆ tih kơjung.

"“When I passed by you again and looked upon you, indeed your time was the time of love; so I spread My wing over you and covered your nakedness. Yes, I swore an oath to you and entered into a covenant with you, and you became Mine,” says the Lord GOD.","Inh năm brih lăng 'bôh ih, sơnăm ih 'lŏ trŏ kơ sơnăm băt kơ hưch wă; Inh iŏk tơdrơi ao Inh tơsu kơ ih, klơ̆p tơdrong koh hoh ih.

"I clothed you in embroidered cloth and gave you sandals of badger skin; I clothed you with fine linen and covered you with silk.","Inh pơhrŭk ăn kơ ih ao dônh, tơ'bot ăn kơ ih chơkhŏ chuă păng akar, tơ̆n ăn kơ ih ao che 'bui, tơsu ăn kơ ih ao che tơpu hơdrông."
"I adorned you with ornaments, put bracelets on your wrists, and a chain on your neck.","Inh iŏk tơmam pơguăng pơhrôp ăn kơ ih, tơ'bot ăn kong tơ ti, tơ'băk ăn kơ ih rơbưn tơ hơko."
"And I put a jewel in your nose, earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head.","Đoh ăn gŏp tơ muh, đoh ăn maih tơ đon, pơyơ̆l ăn hơgăl pơkao tơ kơ̆l ih."
"Thus you were adorned with gold and silver, and your clothing was of fine linen, silk, and embroidered cloth. You ate pastry of fine flour, honey, and oil. You were exceedingly beautiful, and succeeded to royalty.","Ih pơguăng hăm maih, hu, hrŭk ao tai che 'bui tanh hăm brai se, che tơpu hơdrông păng che dônh sĭt.

"Your fame went out among the nations because of your beauty, for it was perfect through My splendor which I had bestowed on you,” says the Lord GOD.","Đơ̆ng tơdrong 'lơ̆ng hơbŏ ih jing ư-ang jơ̆p kơ lu dêh char, yua kơ tơdrong 'lơ̆ng rŏ hơbŏ liĕm, mă Inh 'măn kơ ih, Kră Yang Tih Hloh khan thoi noh."
"“But you trusted in your own beauty, played the harlot because of your fame, and poured out your harlotry on everyone passing by who would have it.","Mă-lei ih gơnang kơ tơdrong 'lơ̆ng liĕm kơdih akâu, yua kơ tơdrong đe ư-ang kơ ih, na ih jing pơm pơyô kư̆ kă chă pơjao akâu kơdih 'bĭch hăm lu bơngai chă năm rok brih găn."
"You took some of your garments and adorned multicolored high places for yourself, and played the harlot on them. Such things should not happen, nor be.","Ih iŏk ao tai wă pơrŏ pơm anih kơjung kơdih wă kơkuh pơyom, pơm pơyô kư̆ kă tơ noh. Tơdrong noh ưh kơ đei layơ trŏ lăp, ưh kơ layơ wă đei."
"You have also taken your beautiful jewelry from My gold and My silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself male images and played the harlot with them.","Ih kư̆m iŏk tơmam pơhrôp pơm hăm maih, hu, mă Inh ăn kơ ih boih; ih pơm lu rup akâu drŏ-nglo, na pơm pơyô kư̆ kă hăm lu noh."
"You took your embroidered garments and covered them, and you set My oil and My incense before them.","Ih iŏk ao sĭt dônh tơsu kơ lu rup noh, iŏk đak rơmă ôliwơ, iŏk pơgang 'bâu phu Inh, na 'măn 'bơ̆t anăp lu sư."
"Also My food which I gave you—the pastry of fine flour, oil, and honey which I fed you—you set it before them as sweet incense; and so it was,” says the Lord GOD.","Tơmam sa mă Inh ăn kơ ih noh, tơpŭng 'lơ̆ng, đak rơmă ôliwơ, đak sut, Inh wă 'me rong ih, na ih chĕp pơyơ̆r pơm tơmam soi soh 'bâu phu 'bơ̆t anăp lu rup noh; noh tơdrong lu iĕm pơm, Kră Yang Tih Hloh khan thoi noh."
"“Moreover you took your sons and your daughters, whom you bore to Me, and these you sacrificed to them to be devoured. Were your acts of harlotry a small matter","Ih kư̆m rôp lu kon drŏ-nglo kon drŏ-kăn ih, mă ih tơpŭ kơ Inh, năm pơyơ̆r ăn kơ lu rup yang noh sa. Dôm tơdrong pơm pơyô kư̆ kă bơih, noh ưh tam mă tôm mă"
"that you have slain My children and offered them up to them by causing them to pass through the fire?","Ih kư̆m pơlôch lu kon Inh, pơm tơmam soi 'buh ăn kơ rup yang noh hă?"
"And in all your abominations and acts of harlotry you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, struggling in your blood.","Lăm dôm tơdrong kơnê̆ krưp, tơdrong pơm pơyô kư̆ kă, ih ưh kơ 'blŏk ôh kơplah năr oei nge, oei koh hoh, pơpơ̆ lăm pham kơdih."
"“Then it was so, after all your wickedness—‘Woe, woe to you!’ says the Lord GOD","Kră Yang Tih Hloh khan: Răm-'băm, răm-'băm tơpă kơ ih, kơ dôm tơdrong kơnê̆ 'mê̆-'mach ih đei pơm."
"that you also built for yourself a shrine, and made a high place for yourself in every street.","Ih kư̆m đei man pơjing kơ ih kơdih anih kơjung, pơdơ̆ng kơ ih anih kơjung lăm rim anih pơlei akŭm pơđâu."
"You built your high places at the head of every road, and made your beauty to be abhorred. You offered yourself to everyone who passed by, and multiplied your acts of harlotry.","Tơ rim kơ̆l trong tih ih đei pơjing anih kơjung kơ ih, hăm lăng ưh kơ gĭt tơdrong 'lơ̆ng hơbŏ ih, tĕch mơdro akâu ih tơ noh, pơyơ̆r akâu kơ lu bơngai yak brih găn pơm kư̆ kă."
"You also committed harlotry with the Egyptians, your very fleshly neighbors, and increased your acts of harlotry to provoke Me to anger.","Ih đei pơm pơyô kư̆ kă hăm lu bơngai Êyiptơ, lu bơngai mă oei jê̆ ih 'bĕnh hăm tơdrong kư̆ kă; ih kư̆m pơm pơyô kư̆ kă lơ tơdrong wă pơm tơblĕk Inh."
"“Behold, therefore, I stretched out My hand against you, diminished your allotment, and gave you up to the will of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who were ashamed of your lewd behavior.","'Nâu Inh yơ̆r ti blah ih, iŏk lê̆ tơmam đơ̆ng ăn kơ ih păng pơjao ih kơ lu bơngai ayăt areh kơ ih, lu kon drŏ-kăn Philistin, lu bơngai mă kơdơ̆ mơlâu yua kơ tơdrong ih pơm pơyô kư̆ kă."
"You also played the harlot with the Assyrians, because you were insatiable; indeed you played the harlot with them and still were not satisfied.","Ih đei pơm pơyô kư̆ kă hăm lu bơngai Asiri, yua kơ ih ưh kơ hrăp. Tơpă ih đei pơm pơyô kư̆ kă hăm lu sư boih, mă-lei tam mă hrăp."
"Moreover you multiplied your acts of harlotry as far as the land of the trader, Chaldea; and even then you were not satisfied.","Ih kư̆m đei pơm pơyô kư̆ kă hăm lu bơngai Kalđê char mơdro sa, mă-lei kư̆m ưh kơ hrăp."
"“How degenerate is your heart!” says the Lord GOD, “seeing you do all these things, the deeds of a brazen harlot.","Kră Yang Tih Hloh khan: Liơ jơhngơ̆m ih 'maih dêh ưh kơ kĕ kơ gơ̆t, ih đei pơm dôm tơdrong noh, ih pơm pơyô kư̆ kă thoi bơngai đi pă hrơ."
"“You erected your shrine at the head of every road, and built your high place in every street. Yet you were not like a harlot, because you scorned payment.","Ih pơm anih kơkuh rim tơm trong, pơjing anih kơjung tơ rim anih akŭm pơđâu lăm pơlei; ih ưh kơ sĭ thoi bơngai drŏ-kăn pơm đi, yua kơ đe ưh kơ apah jên."
"You are an adulterous wife, who takes strangers instead of her husband.","Ih bơih bơngai akăn pơm pơyô hăm đe, ih hưch kơ bơngai nai tơplih kơ klo ih."
"Men make payment to all harlots, but you made your payments to all your lovers, and hired them to come to you from all around for your harlotry.","Lu bơngai drŏ-kăn đi juăt kơ lu drŏ-nglo ăn tơmam, mă-lei ih ăn tơmam kơ đĭ-đăng lu bơngai ih hưch, iŏk răt lu sư năm đơ̆ng jơ̆p tơring wă kơ lu sư pơm pơyô kư̆ kă hăm ih."
"You are the opposite of other women in your harlotry, because no one solicited you to be a harlot. In that you gave payment but no payment was given you, therefore you are the opposite.”","Ih pơm phara kơ lu drŏ-kăn đi nai lăm tơdrong ih pơm pơyô kư̆ kă, lu đe ưh kơ răt ih, tă tơ ih apah đe dơ̆ng tơplih kơ đe apah ih, ih pha tơplơ̆ kơ lu bơngai nai."
"‘Now then, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD!","Na ơ bơngai pơm đi, athei mơ̆ng bĕ nơ̆r Kră Yang."
"Thus says the Lord GOD: “Because your filthiness was poured out and your nakedness uncovered in your harlotry with your lovers, and with all your abominable idols, and because of the blood of your children which you gave to them","'Nâu nơ̆r Kră Yang Tih Hloh khan: “Yua kơ ih tuh tơdrong 'mê̆-'mach pơdah tơdrong hang-hông 'bơ̆t ih pơm pơyô kư̆ kă hăm bơngai mă ih hưch wă, păng yua kơ ih kơkuh kơ lu rup yang kơnê̆ krưp, păng yua kơ ih pơyơ̆r pham lu kon ih kơ lu rup yang noh"
"surely, therefore, I will gather all your lovers with whom you took pleasure, all those you loved, and all those you hated; I will gather them from all around against you and will uncover your nakedness to them, that they may see all your nakedness.","lei na Inh gô akŭm đĭ-đăng lu bơngai ih hưch ih wă, noh lu bơngai ih hưch hăm lu bơngai ih areh; Inh gô akŭm lu sư đơ̆ng jơ̆p kơ anih năm blah ih.

"And I will judge you as women who break wedlock or shed blood are judged; I will bring blood upon you in fury and jealousy.","Inh gô sek tơlang phak ih thoi lu drŏ-kăn pơm pơyô kư̆ kă ưh kơ lăng klo sư păng tuh pham pơlôch đe; Inh gô tuh pham hil mĭl păng gar ih."
"I will also give you into their hand, and they shall throw down your shrines and break down your high places. They shall also strip you of your clothes, take your beautiful jewelry, and leave you naked and bare.","Inh gô jao ih lăm tơpang ti lu bơngai mă ih hưch.

"“They shall also bring up an assembly against you, and they shall stone you with stones and thrust you through with their swords.","Lu sư gô iŏk lu kon pơlei, klơ̆m ih hăm tơmo păng koh hơjăl ih hăm đao."
"They shall burn your houses with fire, and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women; and I will make you cease playing the harlot, and you shall no longer hire lovers.","Lu sư gô iŏk ŭnh soh hnam ih, phak pơmat ih 'bơ̆t anăp lu drŏ-kăn.

"So I will lay to rest My fury toward you, and My jealousy shall depart from you. I will be quiet, and be angry no more.","Tơdrong hil Inh gô ngach, tơdrong Inh gar ih ưh pă đei boih, Inh gô oei hiôk ưh pă hil dơ̆ng."
"Because you did not remember the days of your youth, but agitated Me with all these things, surely I will also recompense your deeds on your own head,” says the Lord GOD. “And you shall not commit lewdness in addition to all your abominations.","Yua kơ ih ưh kơ 'blŏk kơplah ih oei 'lơ̆p sơ̆, na mă pơgreh Inh tôm tơdrong, thoi noh na Inh gô tuh pơdrâu tơ kơpal kơ̆l ih, Kră Yang Tih Hloh khan thoi noh; hăm trŏ kơ ih pơm pơyô kư̆ kă hăm thim đơ̆ng tơdrong kơnê̆ krưp mă Inh areh?"

"You are your mother’s daughter, loathing husband and children; and you are the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and children; your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite.","Ih boih kon drŏ-kăn mĕ ih, bơngai hŭt tŭk lê̆ kon klo; ih jing oh kơ lu mŏ oh ih, bơngai mă hŭt tŭk lê̆ kon klo sư; mĕ ih bơngai Hêtit, 'bă ih bơngai Amôrit"
"“Your elder sister is Samaria, who dwells with her daughters to the north of you; and your younger sister, who dwells to the south of you, is Sodom and her daughters.","Mŏ ih Samari, oei hăm lu kon drŏ-kăn sư tơ gah yă-nơ̆m kơ ih; păng lu oh ih pơlei Sôđôm oei hơdai hăm lu kon drŏ-kăn sư tơ gah gơal kơ ih."
"You did not walk in their ways nor act according to their abominations; but, as if that were too little, you became more corrupt than they in all your ways.","Ih ưh kơ năm kiơ̆ trong lu sư ôh hă?

"“As I live,” says the Lord GOD, “neither your sister Sodom nor her daughters have done as you and your daughters have done.","Kră Yang Tih Hloh khan: Tơpă thoi Inh mă arih ling-lang, oh drŏ-kăn ih pơlei Sôđôm, kơdih sư păng lu kon drŏ-kăn sư ưh tam pơm tơdrong kơnê̆ thoi ih păng lu kon drŏ-kăn ih mă pơm boih."
"Look, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: She and her daughter had pride, fullness of food, and abundance of idleness; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.","'Nâu tơdrong yoch oh drŏ-kăn ih Sôđôm: Sư păng lu kon drŏ-kăn sư pơang, sŏng sa phĭ jơnap, tơmam sa rơkah rơkai, mă-lei ưh kơ tơgŭm lu bơngai dơnuh hin pơmat-tat."
"And they were haughty and committed abomination before Me; therefore I took them away as I saw fit.","Lu sư pơang, pơm yoch kơnê̆ krưp 'bơ̆t anăp Inh, na Inh gô pơrăm lu sư, thoi ih đei 'bôh boih."
"“Samaria did not commit half of your sins; but you have multiplied your abominations more than they, and have justified your sisters by all the abominations which you have done.","Samari pơm yoch tam đei minh puăt tơdrong, yoch mă ih đei pơm; ih pơm boih tơdrong kơnê̆ krưp hloh kơ lu sư.

"You who judged your sisters, bear your own shame also, because the sins which you committed were more abominable than theirs; they are more righteous than you. Yes, be disgraced also, and bear your own shame, because you justified your sisters.","Ih jing pŭ iŏk tơdrong mơlâu yua kơ ih pơm kơ đe mŏ oh ih nhen thoi lu sư tơpăt, yua kơ tơdrong yoch ih pơm kơnê̆ hloh kơ lu sư, đe lăng lu sư tơpăt hloh kơ ih.

"“When I bring back their captives, the captives of Sodom and her daughters, and the captives of Samaria and her daughters, then I will also bring back the captives of your captivity among them","Inh gô ba brŏk Sôđôm hăm lu kon drŏ-kăn sư, păng Samari hăm lu kon drŏ-kăn sư ăn rơngei dơ̆ng păng ih hăm lu sư wih brŏk ăn rơngei."

"When your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, return to their former state, and Samaria and her daughters return to their former state, then you and your daughters will return to your former state.","Mŏ oh ih, Sôđôm hăm lu kon drŏ-kăn sư gô wih hơlơ̆k thoi adrol sơ̆; Samari hăm kon drŏ-kăn sư kư̆m gô wih thoi adrol sơ̆.

"that you may remember and be ashamed, and never open your mouth anymore because of your shame, when I provide you an atonement for all you have done,” says the Lord GOD.’ ”","Na ih gô 'blŏk păng mơlâu kơplah Inh đei mơnat ăn tôm tơdrong mă ih đei pơm, ih pă gơh ha 'bơ̆r pơma dơ̆ng yua kơ mơlâu, Kră Yang tih hloh khan thoi noh.”"

"Again, when a wicked man turns away from the wickedness which he committed, and does what is lawful and right, he preserves himself alive.","Tơdah bơngai mă pơm kơnê̆ hŭt lê̆ tơdrong kơnê̆, tơdrong yoch mă sư pơm boih, na pơm kiơ̆ tơdrong tơpăt tơdrong trŏ, sư gô dŏng pơklaih bơhngol sư đei tơdrong arih ling-lang."
"Because he considers and turns away from all the transgressions which he committed, he shall surely live; he shall not die.","Yua kơ sư 'bôh păng tơbral dôm tơdrong yoch kơnê̆ mă sư hlôi pơm, tơpă sư gô đei tơdrong arih păng ưh kơ đei lôch hiong."
"Yet the house of Israel says, ‘The way of the Lord is not fair.’ O house of Israel, is it not My ways which are fair, and your ways which are not fair?","Adrĕch Isơrael đei khan: Trong Kră Yang ưh kơ tơpăt, Ơ adrĕch Isơrael, trong Inh ưh kơ tơpăt hă? Mă tơpă trong lu iĕm ưh kơ tơpăt."
"“Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways,” says the Lord GOD. “Repent, and turn from all your transgressions, so that iniquity will not be your ruin.","Thoi noh Kră Yang khan: “Ơ adrĕch Isơrael, Inh gô sek tơlang lu iĕm, rim 'nu kiơ̆ kơ tơdrong sư đei pơm.

"Cast away from you all the transgressions which you have committed, and get yourselves a new heart and a new spirit.

"And now she is planted in the wilderness, In a dry and thirsty land.","Dang ei pơtăm sư tơ char glă lăm teh hrĕng kro ưh kơ đei đak."
"Fire has come out from a rod of her branches And devoured her fruit, So that she has no strong branch— a scepter for ruling.’ ” This is a lamentation, and has become a lamentation.","Ŭnh lĕch đơ̆ng tơ'bla sư sa đĭ plei noh, thoi noh na ưh pă đei dơng 'lơ̆ng ayơ oei đei, wă yua pơm 'long jra pơtao.

"“Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “Have you come to inquire of Me?

"Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge them? Then make known to them the abominations of their fathers.","“Ơ kon bơngai, ih wă sek tơlang lu sư ưh, ih wă sek tơlang lu sư hă? Athei Ăn kơ lu sư băt tơdrong kơnê̆ krưp lu yă 'bok lu sư."

"On that day I raised My hand in an oath to them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, ‘flowing with milk and honey,’ the glory of all lands.","Lăm năr noh Inh yơ̆r ti pơkă hăm lu sư, inh gô chông anhăk lu sư lĕch đơ̆ng char Êyiptơ năm tơ anih mă Inh đei chơchă ăn kơ lu sư bơih, teh đei đak toh păng đak sut lơ, noh teh ư-ang hloh kơ đĭ-đăng char."
"Then I said to them, ‘Each of you, throw away the abominations which are before his eyes, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt.

"But they rebelled against Me and would not obey Me. They did not all cast away the abominations which were before their eyes, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said, ‘I will pour out My fury on them and fulfill My anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.’","Mă-lei lu sư oei blah Inh, ưh kơ wă mơ̆ng Inh, ưh kơ hŭt lê̆ rup yang kơnê̆ krưp mă măt lu sư 'maih lăng; kư̆m ưh kơ hŭt lê̆ lu rup yang Êyiptơ.

"But I acted for My name’s sake, that it should not be profaned before the Gentiles among whom they were, in whose sight I had made Myself known to them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt.","Mă-lei yua kơ anăn Inh, wă kơ anăn noh đe huay pơm pơ'mê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp lu kon pơlei nai tơ anih mă lu sư oei.

"“Therefore I made them go out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.","Thoi noh Inh chông tơlĕch lu sư đơ̆ng char Êyiptơ, chông ba lu sư truh tơ char glă."
"And I gave them My statutes and showed them My judgments, ‘which, if a man does, he shall live by them.’","Inh ăn kơ lu sư khôi juăt Inh păng tơ'bôh ăn kơ lu sư nơ̆r Inh tơtă, wă kơ bơngai bu kiơ̆ gô đei tơdrong arih."

"Yet the house of Israel rebelled against Me in the wilderness; they did not walk in My statutes; they despised My judgments, ‘which, if a man does, he shall live by them’; and they greatly defiled My Sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out My fury on them in the wilderness, to consume them.","Mă-lei adrĕch Isơrael blah inh lăm char glă.

"“Notwithstanding, the children rebelled against Me; they did not walk in My statutes, and were not careful to observe My judgments, ‘which, if a man does, he shall live by them’; but they profaned My Sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out My fury on them and fulfill My anger against them in the wilderness.","Mă-lei lu kon sâu lu sư blah Inh; ưh kơ chu kiơ̆ khôi juăt Inh, ưh kơ wei răk nơ̆r Inh tơtă lu tơdrong mă tơdah bu pơm kiơ̆ gô arih; lu sư kư̆m pơm yoch 'mê̆-'mach lăm năr Sa'bat Inh.

"“Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “In this too your fathers have blasphemed Me, by being unfaithful to Me.","Thoi noh, ơ kon bơngai, athei khan kơ adrĕch Isơrael thoi âu: 'Nâu nơ̆r Kră Yang khan: 'Bok yă lu iĕm pơma blông hăm Inh, yua kơ lu sư ưh wă chu Inh."
"When I brought them into the land concerning which I had raised My hand in an oath to give them, and they saw all the high hills and all the thick trees, there they offered their sacrifices and provoked Me with their offerings.

"For when you offer your gifts and make your sons pass through the fire, you defile yourselves with all your idols, even to this day. So shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel?

"‘So that no trees by the waters may ever again exalt themselves for their height, nor set their tops among the thick boughs, that no tree which drinks water may ever be high enough to reach up to them. ‘For they have all been delivered to death, To the depths of the earth, Among the children of men who go down to the Pit.’","Thoi ei na ưh kơ đei 'long ayơ jê̆ đak mă đei chăt kơjung, dah kơnhŏng sư kơjung truh tơ hơmơ̆l păng kư̆m ưh pă đei 'long ayơ mă đei đak ruh hơiuh lơ̆m chăt tih kơjung tih hloh thoi noh yua kơ lu sư đĭ-đăng pơjao kơ tơdrong lôch, jrŭ tơ hơla teh, hơdai hăm lu bơngai yoch mă lôch jur tơ lăm sơlŭng jrŭ."

"I will call for a sword against Gog throughout all My mountains,” says the Lord GOD. “Every man’s sword will be against his brother.","Kră Yang khan: Inh gô krao đao hơlă đơ̆ng rim kơ kông groi Inh blah lu sư; đao hơlă lu sư gô blah 'nhŏng oh sư kơdih."

"“It will come to pass in that day that I will give Gog a burial place there in Israel, the valley of those who pass by east of the sea; and it will obstruct travelers, because there they will bury Gog and all his multitude.

"For seven months the house of Israel will be burying them, in order to cleanse the land.","Lăm tơpơh khei bơngai Isơrael 'bŭ lu sư, wă hơmet rơgoh teh."
"Indeed all the people of the land will be burying, and they will gain renown for it on the day that I am glorified,” says the Lord GOD.","Đĭ-đăng kon pơlei oei lăm char noh gô 'bŭ lu sư, na lăm minh năr ning-mônh Inh pơang lăm kon pơlei noh, năr mă Inh gô pơdah tơdrong ư-ang Inh Kră Yang khan."

"“And as for you, son of man, thus says the Lord GOD, ‘Speak to every sort of bird and to every beast of the field: “Assemble yourselves and come; Gather together from all sides to My sacrificial meal Which I am sacrificing for you, A great sacrificial meal on the mountains of Israel, That you may eat flesh and drink blood.","Gah ih, ơ kon bơngai, Kră Yang khan: Khan bĕ kơ lu sem păr păng lu sem bri akŭm đơ̆ng puăn pah, athei năm akŭm đĭ tơ minh anih pơm phĕt mă inh đei hơmet boih kơ lu iĕm, noh anih pơm yang tih tơ kơpal kông groi Isơrael; lu iĕm gô sa 'nhĕm păng huch pham."

"So the house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God from that day forward.","Đơ̆ng âu tơ anăp, adrĕch Isơrael gô băt Inh boih Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu sư."
"The Gentiles shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity; because they were unfaithful to Me, therefore I hid My face from them.

"after they have borne their shame, and all their unfaithfulness in which they were unfaithful to Me, when they dwelt safely in their own land and no one made them afraid.","Lu sư gô đei tơdrong mơlâu yua kơ đei pơm yoch hăm Inh, kơplah lu sư oei hiôk-hian lăm char noh ưh kơ đei bu tơhli lu sư."

"then they shall know that I am the LORD their God, who sent them into captivity among the nations, but also brought them back to their land, and left none of them captive any longer.","Lu sư gô băt Inh boih Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu sư, mă khan Inh ăn lu sư jing bơnă kơ lu dêh char, mă-lei iŏk wih lu sư tơ char lu sư kơdih, ưh kơ đei lê̆ minh 'nu bơngai bu oei tơ noh."
"And I will not hide My face from them anymore; for I shall have poured out My Spirit on the house of Israel,’ says the Lord GOD.”","Inh ưh pă ôn muh măt Inh kơ lu sư dơ̆ng, yua kơ Inh gô ăn Yang Bơhngol 'Lơ̆ng Inh kơ adrĕch Isơrael, Kră Yang khan thoi noh.”"
"In the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was captured, on the very same day the hand of the LORD was upon me; and He took me there.","Lăm sơnăm mă 'bar-jĭt pơđăm đơ̆ng rŏng kơ lu nhôn pơm bơnă, sơnăm blŭng-a, năr mơjĭt lăm khei, noh trŏ mơjĭt-puăn sơnăm đơ̆ng rŏng kơ pơlei Jêrusalem đe blah iŏk, Lăm năr noh ti Kră Yang chro kơpal inh păng Kră Yang chông ba inh năm tơ noh."
"In the visions of God He took me into the land of Israel and set me on a very high mountain; on it toward the south was something like the structure of a city.","Lăm tơdrong tơ'bôh đơ̆ng Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei, Sư chông ba inh năm tơ char Isơrael păng dan inh 'bơ̆t kông kơjung, kơpal kông.

"He took me there, and behold, there was a man whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze. He had a line of flax and a measuring rod in his hand, and he stood in the gateway.","Kră Yang chông ba inh năm tơ noh, inh 'bôh rup minh 'nu bơngai thoi kơthao kong.

"And the man said to me, “Son of man, look with your eyes and hear with your ears, and fix your mind on everything I show you; for you were brought here so that I might show them to you. Declare to the house of Israel everything you see.”","Bơngai noh khan kơ inh: Ơ kon bơngai athei lăng mă hơlen, athei mơ̆ng mă nhen tôm tơdrong mă inh gô tơ'bôh ăn kơ ih yua kơ ih năm tơ âu wă kơ lăng dôm tơdrong âu.

"Now there was a wall all around the outside of the temple. In the man’s hand was a measuring rod six cubits long, each being a cubit and a handbreadth; and he measured the width of the wall structure, one rod; and the height, one rod.","To, đei dur tơ 'nguaih jum dăr kơ anih hnam akŭm.

"Then he went to the gateway which faced east; and he went up its stairs and measured the threshold of the gateway, which was one rod wide, and the other threshold was one rod wide.","Sư năm tơ măng jang gah hơlĕch, sư tŏk rim kơnao wă pơtŏ kơtơ̆n 'măng, wơ̆l minh hlok."
"Each gate chamber was one rod long and one rod wide; between the gate chambers was a space of five cubits; and the threshold of the gateway by the vestibule of the inside gate was one rod.","Lu anih gak tor minh hlok păng wơ̆l minh hlok, dur tŏk-bŏk lăm lu anih gak să pơđăm hlok; 'măng kơdeng lăm wơ̆l să minh hlok."
"He also measured the vestibule of the inside gate, one rod.","Sư pơtŏ kơdeng, gah lăm 'măng jang minh hlok."
"Then he measured the vestibule of the gateway, eight cubits; and the gateposts, two cubits. The vestibule of the gate was on the inside.","Bơngai pơtŏ kơdeng 'măng jang đei tơhngam hơgăt păng lu jrăng tơjră 'bar hơgăt; kơdeng lăm 'măng jang tơklă gah hnam akŭm"

"Four tables were on this side and four tables on that side, by the side of the gateway, eight tables on which they slaughtered the sacrifices.","Puăn tŏ gơ'bang gah âu păng puăn tŏ gơ'bang gah to kơ 'măng jang, akŭm đĭ đei tơhngam tŏ gơ'bang đe yua wă pơlôch lu tơmam soi."
"There were also four tables of hewn stone for the burnt offering, one cubit and a half long, one cubit and a half wide, and one cubit high; on these they laid the instruments with which they slaughtered the burnt offering and the sacrifice.","Kŭm đei puăn tŏ gơ'bang pơm hăm tơmo blah, wă yua dan hơmet tơmam soi 'buh, tor minh hơgăt minh puăt, wơ̆l minh hơgăt minh puăt, kơjung minh hơgăt, đe dan kơpal noh lu săng wă 'bet pơlôch tơmam soi 'buh păng lu tơmam soi nai."
"Inside were hooks, a handbreadth wide, fastened all around; and the flesh of the sacrifices was on the tables.","Tơ đei 'long chơgăn să sư minh hơda pơ̆ng tăp dăr gah lăm. Lu 'nhĕm tơmam soi dan kơpal gơ'bang."
"Outside the inner gate were the chambers for the singers in the inner court, one facing south at the side of the northern gateway, and the other facing north at the side of the southern gateway.","Tơ cham lăm đei 'bar anih, minh gah cheng kơ 'măng jang yă-nơ̆m, tơklă tơ gah gơal păng đei minh anih dơ̆ng gah 'măng jang hơlĕch, tơklă tơ gah yă-nơ̆m."
"Then he said to me, “This chamber which faces south is for the priests who have charge of the temple.","Sư khan kơ inh: “Anih mă tơklă gơal âu 'măn lê̆ kơ lu 'bok soi mă wei-lăng hnam akŭm."
"The chamber which faces north is for the priests who have charge of the altar; these are the sons of Zadok, from the sons of Levi, who come near the LORD to minister to Him.”","Anih mă tơklă gah yă-nơ̆m 'măn lê̆ kơ lu 'bok soi wei chơnang soi. Noh lu kon drŏ-nglo Sađŏk, lăm lu adrĕch Lêwi gơh năm jê̆ wă bơ̆jang kơ Kră Yang.”"
"And he measured the court, one hundred cubits long and one hundred cubits wide, foursquare. The altar was in front of the temple.","Sư pơtŏ cham lăm, tor đei minh-hrĕng hơgăt, wơ̆l đei minh-hrĕng hơgăt, cham dơ'bŭng wơ̆l tor tŏ ăi. Chơnang soi dan 'bơ̆t anăp hnam akŭm."
"Then he brought me to the vestibule of the temple and measured the doorposts of the vestibule, five cubits on this side and five cubits on that side; and the width of the gateway was three cubits on this side and three cubits on that side.","Sư anhăk ba inh mơ̆t tơ kơdeng hnam akŭm păng pơtŏ lu jrăng kơdeng, pơđăm hơgăt gah âu, pơđăm hlok gah to. 'Măng mơ̆t wơ̆l mơjĭt-puăn hơgăt păng tơnăr hơ'bơ̆l gah âu pêng hơgăt, gah to pêng hơgăt."
"The length of the vestibule was twenty cubits, and the width eleven cubits; and by the steps which led up to it there were pillars by the doorposts, one on this side and another on that side.","Kơdeng tor 'bar-jĭt hơgăt păng wơ̆l mơjĭt-mônh hơgăt; đei kơnao kung tŏk, cheng lu jrăng đei 'long gơ̆ng gah âu minh, gah to minh."
"Then he brought me into the sanctuary and measured the doorposts, six cubits wide on one side and six cubits wide on the other side—the width of the tabernacle.","Sư anhăk ba inh tơ lăm anih 'lơ̆ng rơgoh, Sư pơtŏ lu jrăng tơjră, să sư đei tơdrâu hơgăt, jrăng rim pah tŏ ăi."
"The width of the entryway was ten cubits, and the side walls of the entrance were five cubits on this side and five cubits on the other side; and he measured its length, forty cubits, and its width, twenty cubits.","Wơ̆l trong mơ̆t mơjĭt hơgăt, jrăng trong mơ̆t hơ'bơ̆l pơđăm hơgăt tơ 'bar pah. Bơngai pơtŏ tor anih 'lơ̆ng rơgoh, đei puăn-jĭt hơgăt; păng wơ̆l 'bar-jĭt hơgăt."
"Also he went inside and measured the doorposts, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits high; and the width of the entrance, seven cubits.","Sư mơ̆t tơ lăm anih 'lơ̆ng rơgoh hloh, pơtŏ lu jrăng 'bơ̆t trong 'măng mơ̆t 'bar hơgăt; wơ̆l 'măng mơ̆t să tơdrâu hơgăt; wơ̆l lu jrăng trong sư tơpơh hơgăt."
"He measured the length, twenty cubits; and the width, twenty cubits, beyond the sanctuary; and he said to me, “This is the Most Holy Place.”","Sư pơtŏ, tor anih 'lơ̆ng rơgoh 'bar-jĭt hơgăt, wơ̆l 'bar-jĭt hơgăt păng sư khan kơ inh: “'Nâu anih 'lơ̆ng rơgoh hloh”."
"Next, he measured the wall of the temple, six cubits. The width of each side chamber all around the temple was four cubits on every side.","Sư pơtŏ dur hnam akŭm hơ'bơ̆l tơdrâu hơgăt, wơ̆l lu anih cheng jum dăr kơ hnam akŭm, puăn hơgăt."
"The side chambers were in three stories, one above the other, thirty chambers in each story; they rested on ledges which were for the side chambers all around, that they might be supported, but not fastened to the wall of the temple.","Lu anih cheng đei pêng tăl, kơpơ̆ng ala lăm minh tăl đei pêng-jĭt tŏ lăm; anih hnam noh đei jrăng tơjră kơdih, ưh kơ hơgơn tơ tơnăr hnam akŭm."
"As one went up from story to story, the side chambers became wider all around, because their supporting ledges in the wall of the temple ascended like steps; therefore the width of the structure increased as one went up from the lowest story to the highest by way of the middle one.","Lu anih cheng tăp dăr kơ hnam akŭm, đơ̆ng tăl âu truh tăl kơpal; rai kơjung rai să hloh yua kơ đe pơm hnam akŭm tăl rai kơjung lăm rai să đơ̆ng tăl âu tŏk tơ tăl noh, na wơ̆l hnam akŭm kư̆m rai să mưh tăl rai kơjung. Đe năm tŏk đơ̆ng tăl kơđeh hloh wă tŏk tăl kơjung hloh rok tăl tŏk-bŏk."
"I also saw an elevation all around the temple; it was the foundation of the side chambers, a full rod, that is, six cubits high.","Inh 'bôh hnam akŭm đei kơdeng hloh tơ rok tơnăr đei anih tăp dăr, noh hơnă rim anih gah cheng kơdeng hloh pơtŏ đei minh hơgăt, kơjung wă đei tơdrâu hơgăt."
"The thickness of the outer wall of the side chambers was five cubits, and so also the remaining terrace by the place of the side chambers of the temple.","Tơnăr 'nguaih lu anih cheng hơ'bơ̆l pơđăm hơgăt păng anih hoh tăp dăr kơ noh pơđăm hơgăt. Hơlam lu anih cheng hnam akŭm."
"And between it and the wall chambers was a width of twenty cubits all around the temple on every side.","Hăm lu anih cheng jih dur cham lăm wơ̆l 'bar-jĭt hơgăt. ‘Noh jum dăr kơ hnam akŭm puăn pah."
"The doors of the side chambers opened on the terrace, one door toward the north and another toward the south; and the width of the terrace was five cubits all around.","'Măng lu anih cheng pơm 'măng tơ gah sơlam. Minh pôm 'măng tơ gah yă-nơ̆m, minh pôm 'măng tơ gah gơal; wơ̆l să noh pơđăm hơgăt jum dăr."
"The building that faced the separating courtyard at its western end was seventy cubits wide; the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length ninety cubits.","Hnam tơklă cham hnam akŭm gah bơmơ̆t, wơ̆l tơpơh-jĭt hơgăt; tơnăr jum dăr hnam hơ'bơ̆l pơđăm hơgăt tor tơsĭn-jĭt hơgăt."
"So he measured the temple, one hundred cubits long; and the separating courtyard with the building and its walls was one hundred cubits long","Na bơngai noh pơtŏ hnam akŭm tor minh-hrĕng hơgăt, cham hnam akŭm păng tơnăr kư̆m kơjung minh-hrĕng hơgăt."
"also the width of the eastern face of the temple, including the separating courtyard, was one hundred cubits.","Wơ̆l anăp hnam păng cham gah hơlĕch kư̆m minh-hrĕng hơgăt."
"He measured the length of the building behind it, facing the separating courtyard, with its galleries on the one side and on the other side, one hundred cubits, as well as the inner temple and the porches of the court","Na, sư pơtŏ tor cham tơ gah bơmơ̆t păng hnam kơdeng 'bar pah minh-hrĕng hơgăt. Gah lăm anih 'lơ̆ng rơgoh kơdeng tơklă cham"
"their doorposts and the beveled window frames. And the galleries all around their three stories opposite the threshold were paneled with wood from the ground to the windows—the windows were covered","lu kơtơ̆n 'măng, lu 'măng-'mŏk pơ̆ng dơhlông, lu kơdeng jum dăr, đei pêng pah gah anăp tơklă kơ kơtơ̆n 'măng, lăm hnam akŭm đe pơ̆ng tơ̆r 'long tăp dăr.

"from the space above the door, even to the inner room, as well as outside, and on every wall all around, inside and outside, by measure.","Kơpal trong mơ̆t, tơ anih 'lơ̆ng rơgoh, tơ lăm păng tơ 'nguaih, kơpal tơnăr tăp dăr, tơ lăm hăm tơ 'nguaih kư̆m đei chhơ̆ rup."
"And it was made with cherubim and palm trees, a palm tree between cherub and cherub. Each cherub had two faces","Chhơ̆ rup chêrubim hăm rup 'long gol, minh rup 'long gol tŏk-bŏk sơlam 'bar tŏ rup chêrubim; rim kơ chêrubim đei 'bar pah măt"
"so that the face of a man was toward a palm tree on one side, and the face of a young lion toward a palm tree on the other side; thus it was made throughout the temple all around.","măt bơngai tơwih tơ gah rup 'long gol pah âu păng măt dăm-brang tơwih gah rup 'long gol pah to jơ̆p tăp tang kơ lăm hnam akŭm đei chhơ̆ thoi noh."
"From the floor to the space above the door, and on the wall of the sanctuary, cherubim and palm trees were carved.","Đơ̆ng hơnă truh tơ kơpal măng, đei chhơ̆ rup chêrubim păng chhơ̆ rup 'long gol tơ jơ̆p kơ tơnăr hnam akŭm."
"The doorposts of the temple were square, as was the front of the sanctuary; their appearance was similar.","Lu jrăng 'măng anih 'lơ̆ng rơgoh sư dơ'bŭng. Păng 'măng 'bơ̆t anăp anih 'lơ̆ng rơgoh hloh kư̆m lei-lăi thoi noh."
"The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and its length two cubits. Its corners, its length, and its sides were of wood; and he said to me, “This is the table that is before the LORD.”","Chơnang soi pơm hăm 'long kơjung pêng hlok, tor 'bar hơgăt, wơ̆l 'bar hơgăt, lu mum, jơ̆ng, hơnă pơm hăm 'long. Bơngai noh khan kơ inh: “Âu, boih gơ'bang 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang."
"The temple and the sanctuary had two doors.","Anih 'lơ̆ng rơgoh păng anih 'lơ̆ng rơgoh hloh đei 'bar pah tơnang 'măng."
"The doors had two panels apiece, two folding panels: two panels for one door and two panels for the other door.","Rim 'măng đei 'bar pah tơnang 'măng, noh tơnang 'măng gơh tang gah âu 'bar pah, gah to 'bar pah."
"Cherubim and palm trees were carved on the doors of the temple just as they were carved on the walls. A wooden canopy was on the front of the vestibule outside.","Đe đei chhơ̆ lu rup chêrubim păng lu 'long gol tơ kơpal 'măng hnam akŭm, kư̆m thoi đei chhơ̆ tơ tơnăr. Kơpal ‘măng mơ̆t tơ kơdeng anăp gah 'nguaih đei bơbŭng pơm păng tơ̆r."
"There were beveled window frames and palm trees on one side and on the other, on the sides of the vestibule—also on the side chambers of the temple and on the canopies.","Đei lu 'măng-'mŏk dơhlông păng lu rup 'long gol chhơ̆ tơ 'bar pah tơ kơpal kơ jrăng, lăm lu anih cheng hnam akŭm păng lu anih iĕ đei mơ̆n."
"Then he brought me out into the outer court, by the way toward the north; and he brought me into the chamber which was opposite the separating courtyard, and which was opposite the building toward the north.","Sư chông ba inh lĕch tơ cham 'nguaih, gah yă-nơ̆m, ba inh mơ̆t tơ lăm anih tơklă hăm cham hnam akŭm păng dur gah yă-nơ̆m."
"Facing the length, which was one hundred cubits (the width was fifty cubits), was the north door.","Anih hnam mă đei ‘măng mơ̆t gah yă-nơ̆m tor minh-hrĕng hơgăt, đei 'măng gah yă-nơ̆m, wơ̆l sư pơđăm-jĭt hơgăt."
"Opposite the inner court of twenty cubits, and opposite the pavement of the outer court, was gallery against gallery in three stories.","Hơlam rơhơi să 'bar-jĭt hơgăt tơklă cham lăm păng, hơnă tơmo tơ cham 'nguaih, đei lu kơdeng pơtrơp băl pêng tăl."
"In front of the chambers, toward the inside, was a walk ten cubits wide, at a distance of one cubit; and their doors faced north.","'Bơ̆t anăp lu anih đei trong wơ̆l mơjĭt hơgăt, tor kơjung đei minh-hrĕng hơgăt. Păng đei lu trong năm mơ̆t tơ gah yă-nơ̆m."
"Now the upper chambers were shorter, because the galleries took away space from them more than from the lower and middle stories of the building.","Lu anih tơ kơpal iĕ hloh kơ lu anih tơ ala păng lu anih tŏk-bŏk hnam, yua kơ lu kơdeng găn."
"For they were in three stories and did not have pillars like the pillars of the courts; therefore the upper level was shortened more than the lower and middle levels from the ground up.","Rim anih đei pêng tăl mă-lei ưh kơ đei jrăng thoi jrăng cham yua kơ thoi noh na anih kơpal iĕ hloh kơ anih ala păng anih tŏk-bŏk."
"And a wall which was outside ran parallel to the chambers, at the front of the chambers, toward the outer court; its length was fifty cubits.","Đei tơnăr gah 'nguaih pơrok kiơ̆ lu anih tơwih gah cham 'nguaih, tơklă lu anih mă să tor pơđăm-jĭt hơgăt."
"The length of the chambers toward the outer court was fifty cubits, whereas that facing the temple was one hundred cubits.","Tor lu anih gah cham 'nguaih pơđăm-jĭt hơgăt, mă-lei lu anih tơklă hnam akŭm noh đei minh-hrĕng hơgăt."
"At the lower chambers was the entrance on the east side, as one goes into them from the outer court.","Tơ gah hơlĕch kơ lu anih 'nâu tơ ala, gah hơlĕch đei minh trong mơ̆t, 'măn kơ lu bơngai đơ̆ng cham 'nguaih mơ̆t."
"Also there were chambers in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, opposite the separating courtyard and opposite the building.","Tơm tơnăr cham lăm hnam akŭm gah gơal, tơklă 'bơ̆t sơlam hnam akŭm đei lu anih."
"There was a walk in front of them also, and their appearance was like the chambers which were toward the north; they were as long and as wide as the others, and all their exits and entrances were according to plan.","Đei minh trong năm tơ anăp lu anih noh, kư̆m thoi trong năm rim lu anih gah yă-nơ̆m; lu anih noh tor wơ̆l să lei-lăi. Đĭ-đăng lu trong lĕch trong mơ̆t tơdrong hơmet păng 'măng kư̆m lei-lăi."
"And corresponding to the doors of the chambers that were facing south, as one enters them, there was a door in front of the walk, the way directly in front of the wall toward the east.","Kơ lu 'măng anih gah gơal kư̆m lei-lăi; đei minh pôm 'măng 'bơ̆t tơm trong năm wă kơ đe mơ̆t lĕch, pơrok kiơ̆ tơnăr tơklă gah hơlĕch."
"Then he said to me, “The north chambers and the south chambers, which are opposite the separating courtyard, are the holy chambers where the priests who approach the LORD shall eat the most holy offerings. There they shall lay the most holy offerings—the grain offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering—for the place is holy.","Na sư khan kơ inh: “Lu anih gah yă-nơ̆m păng anih gah gơal, tơklă hăm cham lăm noh boih anih rơgoh anih lu 'bok soi năm jê̆ Kră Yang gô sa tơmam soi 'lơ̆ng rơgoh hloh.

"When the priests enter them, they shall not go out of the holy chamber into the outer court; but there they shall leave their garments in which they minister, for they are holy. They shall put on other garments; then they may approach that which is for the people.”","Mưh lu 'bok soi hlôi mơ̆t tơ anih rơgoh boih, lu sư ưh kơ gơh lĕch đơ̆ng anih rơgoh noh na năm tơ cham 'nguaih, mă-lei athei plôh lê̆ ao 'bok soi mă lu sư hrŭk wă soi kơ Kră Yang yua kơ lu hơbĕn ao noh 'lơ̆ng rơgoh; lu sư athei iŏk hrŭk ao nai, na lu sư gơh lĕch tơ 'nguaih anih mă 'măn kơ lu kon pơlei."
"Now when he had finished measuring the inner temple, he brought me out through the gateway that faces toward the east, and measured it all around.","Đang kơ pơtŏ keh lăm hnam akŭm sư anhăk ba inh lĕch trong 'măng gah hơlĕch tơ cham gah 'nguaih păng pơtŏ jum dăr cham gah 'nguaih kơ hnam akŭm."
"He measured the east side with the measuring rod, five hundred rods by the measuring rod all around.","Sư pơtŏ gah hơlĕch hăm tơlei pơtŏ, đei pơđăm-hrĕng hơgăt, kiơ̆ kơ tơlei pơtŏ."
"He measured the north side, five hundred rods by the measuring rod all around.","Sư tơwih rŏng pơtŏ gah yă-nơ̆m tơlei pơtŏ lei-lăi, pơđăm-hrĕng hơgăt kiơ̆ kơ tơlei pơtŏ."
"He measured the south side, five hundred rods by the measuring rod.","Sư tơwih rŏng pơtŏ gah gơal lei-lăi, kư̆m pơđăm-hrĕng hơgăt kiơ̆ kơ tơlei pơtŏ."
"He came around to the west side and measured five hundred rods by the measuring rod.","Sư weh pơtŏ gah bơmơ̆t, đei pơđăm hơgăt kiơ̆ kơ tơlei pơtŏ."
"He measured it on the four sides; it had a wall all around, five hundred cubits long and five hundred wide, to separate the holy areas from the common.","Thoi noh sư pơtŏ puăn pah jum dăr kơ cham hnam akŭm tor pơđăm-hrĕng hơgăt, wơ̆l pơđăm-hrĕng hơgăt; tơnăr âu plah sơlam anih 'lơ̆ng rơgoh păng anih hmă."
"Afterward he brought me to the gate, the gate that faces toward the east.","Na sư anhăk ba inh truh tơ 'măng jang gah hơlĕch."
"And behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east. His voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shone with His glory.","Inh 'bôh tơdrong ư-ang rang mơnhal Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael năm đơ̆ng gah hơlĕch đei jơwa nhen thoi đak ro tih, hơdah rang mơnhal ư-ang Kră Yang jơ̆p kơ teh."
"It was like the appearance of the vision which I saw—like the vision which I saw when I came to destroy the city. The visions were like the vision which I saw by the River Chebar; and I fell on my face.","Tơdrong mă inh 'bôh nhen thoi tơdrong mă tơ'bôh kơ inh kơplah Kră Yang pơrăm pơlei.

"And the glory of the LORD came into the temple by way of the gate which faces toward the east.","Tơdrong ư-ang rang mơnhal Kră Yang mơ̆t tơ lăm hnam akŭm trong 'măng jang gah hơlĕch."
"The Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of the LORD filled the temple.","Yang bơhngol hơtŏk inh păng chông ba inh mơ̆t tơ cham gah lăm; to tơdrong rang mơnhal Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei 'bĕnh-'bang kơ hnam akŭm."
"Then I heard Him speaking to me from the temple, while a man stood beside me.","Kơplah đei bơngai noh dơ̆ng jê̆ inh, inh kơtơ̆ng đei nơ̆r pơma hăm inh đơ̆ng lăm hnam akŭm."
"And He said to me, “Son of man, this is the place of My throne and the place of the soles of My feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel forever. No more shall the house of Israel defile My holy name, they nor their kings, by their harlotry or with the carcasses of their kings on their high places.","Sư pơma hăm inh khan: “Ơ kon bơngai, âu jing anih mă Inh dan tang-dŏ Inh, anih mă Inh dan jơ̆ng tơ âu Inh gô oei hơdai ling-lang hăm adrĕch adrung Isơrael.

"When they set their threshold by My threshold, and their doorpost by My doorpost, with a wall between them and Me, they defiled My holy name by the abominations which they committed; therefore I have consumed them in My anger.","Đơ̆ng lu sư dan kơtơ̆n 'măng hnam lu sư 'bơ̆t jê̆ kơtơ̆n 'măng hnam Inh, dan jrăng 'măng hnam lu sư jê̆ jrăng 'măng hnam Inh, đei tơnăr pĕng găn sơlam Inh păng lu sư đĕch, lu sư pơm kơnê̆ 'mê̆-'mach boih kơ anăn 'lơ̆ng rơgoh Inh.

"Now let them put their harlotry and the carcasses of their kings far away from Me, and I will dwell in their midst forever.","Dang ei lu sư athei hŭt lê̆ tơdrong pơm pơyô kư̆ kă păng akâu lu pơtao lôch ataih đơ̆ng Inh, Inh gô oei hơdai lu sư ling-lang hlŏng hloi."
"“Son of man, describe the temple to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure the pattern.","Gah ih, ơ kon bơngai athei roi tơ'bôh kơ adrĕch Isơrael băt kơ hnam akŭm âu, wă kơ lu sư mơlâu kơ tơdrong yoch mă lu sư đei pơm, wă kơ lu sư pơtŏ lăng kiơ̆ kơ tơdrong 'nâu."
"And if they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the design of the temple and its arrangement, its exits and its entrances, its entire design and all its ordinances, all its forms and all its laws. Write it down in their sight, so that they may keep its whole design and all its ordinances, and perform them.","Tơdah lu sư mơlâu kơ tôm tơdrong lu sư hlôi pơm, tơ'bôh ăn bĕ kơ lu sư rup đe pơdơ̆ng hnam akŭm âu, trong lu 'măng mơ̆t 'măng lĕch, đĭ-đăng lu rup chhơ̆, đĭ-đăng tôm tơdrong juăt Sư, lu rup sư păng đĭ-đăng khôi juăt ăn kơ sư.

"This is the law of the temple: The whole area surrounding the mountaintop is most holy. Behold, this is the law of the temple.","Âu khôi juăt gah hnam akŭm: Đĭ-đăng anih tăp dăr kơ kơpal kông, noh anih 'lơ̆ng rơgoh. Noh boih khôi juăt hnam akŭm. Chơnang soi"
"“These are the measurements of the altar in cubits (the cubit is one cubit and a handbreadth): the base one cubit high and one cubit wide, with a rim all around its edge of one span. This is the height of the altar","Âu tơdrong pơtŏ chơnang soi, pơtŏ hăm tơlei pơtŏ kơjung minh hơgăt minh hơđa.

"The altar hearth is four cubits high, with four horns extending upward from the hearth.","Chơnang soi kơjung puăn hlok păng kơpal chơnang soi đei puăn tŏ hơke pơdơ̆ng."
"The altar hearth is twelve cubits long, twelve wide, square at its four corners","Anih chơnang soi tor să mơjĭt-'bar hơgăt, wơ̆l mơjĭt hơgăt, dơ'bŭng đei puăn pah mum."

"You shall give a young bull for a sin offering to the priests, the Levites, who are of the seed of Zadok, who approach Me to minister to Me,’ says the Lord GOD.","Kră Yang khan: Pơjao bĕ kơ 'bok soi adrĕch Lêwi lăm, adrĕch Sađôk noh, lu bơngai gô năm jê̆ wă bơ̆jang kơ Inh, minh pôm rơmo dăm bek wă pơm tơmam soi huai đơ̆ng yoch."
"‘You shall take some of its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar, on the four corners of the ledge, and on the rim around it; thus you shall cleanse it and make atonement for it.","Ih iŏk bĕ pham pik tơ puăn tŏ hơke chơnang soi, tơ puăn pah mum păng tơ gơnăp jum dăr, wă kơ ôp rơgoh chơnang soi păng huai đơ̆ng yoch."

"When you brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in My sanctuary to defile it—My house—and when you offered My food, the fat and the blood, then they broke My covenant because of all your abominations.","Lu iĕm hlôi chông ba adrĕch adrung kon pơlei tơmoi, lu bơngai mă ưh kơ kăt tơdra jơhngơ̆m, kư̆m ưh kơ kăt tơdra akar mơ̆t lăm anih 'lơ̆ng rơgoh Inh wă pơ'mê̆ kơ hnam akŭm Inh, kơplah lu iĕm pơyơ̆r tơmam sa kơ Inh, rơmă păng pham; lu iĕm pơm yoch glăi boih kơ nơ̆r pơkă Inh hăm tơdrong kơnê̆ 'mê̆ krưp lu iĕm."

"The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the temple, on the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and on the gateposts of the gate of the inner court.","'Bok soi gô iŏk pham tơmam soi huai đơ̆ng yoch na pik tơ lu jrăng hnam akŭm, tơ puăn pah mum jơ̆ng chơnang soi păng lu jrăng 'măng jang cham gah lăm."
"And so you shall do on the seventh day of the month for everyone who has sinned unintentionally or in ignorance.

"The prince shall enter by way of the vestibule of the gateway from the outside, and stand by the gatepost. The priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings.

"“Now when the prince makes a voluntary burnt offering or voluntary peace offering to the LORD, the gate that faces toward the east shall then be opened for him; and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings as he did on the Sabbath day.

"But if he gives a gift of some of his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall be his until the year of liberty, after which it shall return to the prince. But his inheritance shall belong to his sons; it shall become theirs.","Mă-lei tơdah 'bok yŏng iŏk minh lăm tơmam noh na ăn kơ lu đĭch đam sư, tơmam noh jing tơmam kơ đĭch đam sư truh tơ sư rơngei; tơmam noh pơdrâu kơ yŏng noh.

"Moreover the prince shall not take any of the people’s inheritance by evicting them from their property; he shall provide an inheritance for his sons from his own property, so that none of My people may be scattered from his property.” ’ ”","Yŏng pơgơ̆r ưh kơ gơh iŏk mŭk tơmam kiơ đơ̆ng kon pơlei, dah pơgŏ tơgar iŏk mŭk tơmam lu sư; sư gô iŏk tơmam sư kơdih na ăn kơ lu kon sâu wă bơ̆jang sa, thoi noh na kon pơlei Inh ưh kơ đei bu đe gơh tơgar iŏk mŭk tơmam đơ̆ng lu sư."
"Now he brought me through the entrance, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests which face toward the north; and there a place was situated at their extreme western end.","Đơ̆ng noh sư chông ba inh mơ̆t rok trong 'măng jang cheng, năm truh tơ anih 'lơ̆ng rơgoh gah yă-nơ̆m wă 'măn kơ lu 'bok soi; tơ noh đei minh anih tơ tuch-luch gah bơmơ̆t."
"And he said to me, “This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, and where they shall bake the grain offering, so that they do not bring them out into the outer court to sanctify the people.”","Sư khan kơ inh: “'Nâu anih lu 'bok soi hơtŭk 'nhĕm tơmam soi huai đơ̆ng yoch păng tơmam soi huai đơ̆ng glăi păng soh tơmam soi phe ba wă huay kơ anhăk ba tơ cham gah 'nguaih kơnh hli pơm kơ kon pơlei jing 'lơ̆ng rơgoh.”"
"Then he brought me out into the outer court and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and in fact, in every corner of the court there was another court.","Sư kư̆m chông ba inh tơ cham gah 'nguaih, chông inh năm tơ puăn pah mum cham; âu inh 'bôh tơ rim mum cham đei minh hlak cham nai."
"In the four corners of the court were enclosed courts, forty cubits long and thirty wide; all four corners were the same size.","Tơ rim puăn pah mum cham, đei cham iĕ, tor kơjung puăn-jĭt hơgăt wơ̆l pêng-jĭt hơgăt; đĭ-đăng puăn hlak cham tơ puăn pah mum, să iĕ tor wơ̆l lei-lăi."
"There was a row of building stones all around in them, all around the four of them; and cooking hearths were made under the rows of stones all around.","Tơ lăm lu cham noh đei tơnăr gŏch jum dăr păng jum dăr jơ̆ng tơnăr đei trôm pơm tơnuh anih wă pai."
"And he said to me, “These are the kitchens where the ministers of the temple shall boil the sacrifices of the people.”","Sư khan kơ inh: Âu boih hnam gŏ, anih lu bơngai bơ̆jang awih awăn lăm hnam akŭm pai hơtŭk lu tơmam soi đơ̆ng kon pơlei pơyơ̆r.”"
"Then he brought me back to the door of the temple; and there was water, flowing from under the threshold of the temple toward the east, for the front of the temple faced east; the water was flowing from under the right side of the temple, south of the altar.","Bơngai noh, sư chông ba inh wih dơ̆ng tơ ‘măng mơ̆t tơ anih hnam akŭm; na inh 'bôh đak ro đơ̆ng ala kơtơ̆n 'măng anih hnam akŭm, ro gah hơlĕch; yua kơ anăp hnam akŭm tơ gah hơlĕch, Đak đơ̆ng ala 'măng hnam akŭm gah gơal ro năm tơ gah gơal kơ chơnang soi."
"He brought me out by way of the north gate, and led me around on the outside to the outer gateway that faces east; and there was water, running out on the right side.","Bơngai noh sư chông ba inh trong 'măng gah yă-nơ̆m, lĕch tơ 'nguaih kơ cham; sư ba inh năm jum dăr gah 'nguaih truh tơ 'nguaih kơ 'măng gah hơlĕch; păng to đei đak ro đơ̆ng gah gơal kơ ‘măng noh."
"And when the man went out to the east with the line in his hand, he measured one thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the water came up to my ankles.","Bơngai noh năm rok gah hơlĕch ti sư chĕp ba minh tơlei pơtŏ păng pơtŏ đei minh-rơbâu hơgăt, sư chông ba inh tŏk kơ đak tŏk dang kiơ̆ plei kĕnh."
"Again he measured one thousand and brought me through the waters; the water came up to my knees. Again he measured one thousand and brought me through; the water came up to my waist.","Bơngai noh pơtŏ minh-rơbâu hơgăt dơ̆ng, na chông inh tŏk kơ đak, đak jrŭ dang kŭl-tăng; sư đei pơtŏ minh-rơbâu hơgăt dơ̆ng na chông ba inh tŏk kơ đak, đak jrŭ tôch kiơ̆ kơiĕng."
"Again he measured one thousand, and it was a river that I could not cross; for the water was too deep, water in which one must swim, a river that could not be crossed.","Bơngai noh sư pơtŏ dơ̆ng minh-rơbâu hơgăt; tơ âu jơ̆ đak tih jing krong boih, inh ưh pă gơh tŏk boih, yua kơ đak krong tŏk; đak jrŭ athei glơi, ưh pă gơh tŏk hlôi boih."
"He said to me, “Son of man, have you seen this?” Then he brought me and returned me to the bank of the river.","Bơngai noh sư khan kơ inh: “Ơ, kon bơngai, ih hăm 'bôh ưh? Sư chông ba inh wơ̆t 'bơ̆t đak krong."

"Then he said to me: “This water flows toward the eastern region, goes down into the valley, and enters the sea. When it reaches the sea, its waters are healed.","Sư khan kơ inh: “Đak krong âu ro tơpăt tơ gah hơlĕch, truh tơ tơring Araba, ro mơ̆t tơ đak dơsĭ, mưh ro truh tơ đak dơsĭ boih đak dơsĭ noh gô hlăng 'lơ̆ng."
"And it shall be that every living thing that moves, wherever the rivers go, will live. There will be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters go there; for they will be healed, and everything will live wherever the river goes.","Đak krong ro truh tơ yơ, lu kon sem, hơdrông kơep lep-ler đei arih tơ noh.

"It shall be that fishermen will stand by it from En Gedi to En Eglaim; they will be places for spreading their nets. Their fish will be of the same kinds as the fish of the Great Sea, exceedingly many.","Lu bơngai traih ka gô dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t jih krong; đơ̆ng pơlei Êngêđi truh tơ Ên Eglaim đei anih wă dăng hơnhuăl; tơ noh đei lơ ka tôm kơ adrĕch ka kư̆m thoi lăm đak Dơsĭ Tih."
"But its swamps and marshes will not be healed; they will be given over to salt.","Đak lăm lu Dơnâu hlŭt tơ noh ưh pă hlăng 'ngam, mă-lei 'măn kơ pơm 'boh."
"Along the bank of the river, on this side and that, will grow all kinds of trees used for food; their leaves will not wither, and their fruit will not fail. They will bear fruit every month, because their water flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food, and their leaves for medicine.”","Tơ tơter jih đak krong 'bar pah đe pơtăm tôm kơ lu 'long plei sa, lu hla ưh kơ hơlŭng, lu 'long đei plei hơnơ̆ng, rim khei đei pơkao plei 'lơ̆ng yua kơ đei đak ro lĕch đơ̆ng hnam akŭm.

"Thus says the Lord GOD: “These are the borders by which you shall divide the land as an inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel.

"“Thus you shall divide this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel.","Lei na lu iĕm klah asong băl teh âu, kiơ̆ kơ khŭl adrĕch bơngai Isơrael."
"It shall be that you will divide it by lot as an inheritance for yourselves, and for the strangers who dwell among you and who bear children among you.
