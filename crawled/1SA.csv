"Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim, of the mountains of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.","Đei minh 'nu bơngai drŏ-nglo đơ̆ng pơlei Ramathaim Suphima lăm tơring groi kông Êphraim anăn sư Êlkana, kon drŏ-nglo Jêrôham sâu Êlihu, sâu i Tơhu, sâu ach Sup, bơngai adrĕch Êphraim."
"And he had two wives: the name of one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.","Sư đei 'bar 'nu akăn; minh 'nu anăn sư Hana, minh 'nu nai anăn sư Pênina. Pêninia đei kon hơ'lơ̆p mă-lei An ưh kơ đei hơ'lơ̆p."
"This man went up from his city yearly to worship and sacrifice to the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. Also the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.","Rim sơnăm Êlkana lĕch đơ̆ng pơlei sư tŏk năm tơ pơlei Silô akŭm kơkuh păng wă pơyơ̆r tơmam soi kơ Kră Yang Tih Hloh. Tơ noh đei 'bar 'nu kon drŏ-nglo Hêli, bre Hopni păng Phinêhas, pơm 'bok soi Kră Yang."
"And whenever the time came for Elkanah to make an offering, he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters.","Năr Êlkana pơyơ̆r tơmam soi sư klah asong minh kơ Pênina akăn sư păng kơ rim 'nu kon drŏ-nglo, kon drŏ-kăn sư."
"But to Hannah he would give a double portion, for he loved Hannah, although the LORD had closed her womb.","Na sư asong ăn kơ Hana 'bar yua kơ sư hưch dêh kơ Hana, mă-lei Kră Yang ăn kơ sư hơwŏng."
"And her rival also provoked her severely, to make her miserable, because the LORD had closed her womb.","Pênina jơ̆ păng pơklai jơhngơ̆m sư, yua kơ Kră Yang ăn kơ sư hơwŏng."
"So it was, year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, that she provoked her; therefore she wept and did not eat.","Ling-lang thoi noh lăm rim sơnăm; rim wơ̆t Hana tŏk năm tơ hnam Kră Yang Pênina ơh pơklai lăm jơhngơ̆m. Dĭng mah Hana nhơ̆m păng ưh kơ sŏng sa."
"Then Elkanah her husband said to her, “Hannah, why do you weep? Why do you not eat? And why is your heart grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”","Êlkana klo sư khan kơ sư, ơ Hana, yua kơ kiơ ih nhơ̆m? Hăm yua kơ kiơ ih ưh kơ sŏng sa? Yua kơ kiơ jơhngơ̆m ih sơ'ngon? Liơ ih đei inh bơih ưh kơ gĭt hloh kơ đei mơjĭt 'nu kon drŏ-nglo hă?"
"So Hannah arose after they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat by the doorpost of the tabernacle of the LORD.","Đang kơ lu sư sŏng sa tơ pơlei Silô bơih, Hana iung, kơplah noh Hêli, oei ngôi hơ-oei kơpal tang-dŏ jê̆ 'măng mơ̆t tơ hnam Kră Yang."
"And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to the LORD and wept in anguish.","Hana jơhngơ̆m sư rŭng răng ưh kơsŭk sư krao apinh Kră Yang sư nhơ̆m sơ'ngon dêh."
"Then she made a vow and said, “O LORD of hosts, if You will indeed look on the affliction of Your maidservant and remember me, and not forget Your maidservant, but will give Your maidservant a male child, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and no razor shall come upon his head.”","Sư pơma pơkă khan: Ơ Kră Yang Tih Hloh, tơdah ih lăng mơnat kơ đam drŏ-kăn ih, 'blŏk bĕ kơ inh 'nĕ kơ hiơt kơ inh đam drŏ-kăn ih, mă-lei gô ăn kơ đam drŏ-kăn ih đei minh 'nu kon drŏ-nglo, thoi ei inh gô ăn sư kơ ih Kră Yang đĭ chăl arih sư, ưh kơ gơh yuă dah hơkôih sŏk sư."
"And it happened, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli watched her mouth.","Kơplah sư oei krao khan 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, Hêli lăng 'bơ̆r sư."
"Now Hannah spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she was drunk.","Hana pơma lăm jơhngơ̆m sư, hơkŭng sư đĕch pơpơ̆; đe ưh kơ đei kơtơ̆ng nơ̆r sư ôh. Na Hêli tơchĕng khan, Hana suai sik."
"So Eli said to her, “How long will you be drunk? Put your wine away from you!”","Na Hêli khan kơ sư. Dang yơ ih praih kơ suai sik? Lê̆ pă et."
"But Hannah answered and said, “No, my lord, I am a woman of sorrowful spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor intoxicating drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.","Hana tơl, ưh, ơ yŏng tơ'ngla inh, inh minh 'nu bơngai drŏ-kăn ơh sơ'ngon dêh. Inh ưh kơ đei et sik ôh, kư̆m ưh kơ đei suai mơ̆n, yua kơ inh tơ'bôh đĭ jơhngơ̆m inh kơ Kră Yang."
"“Do not consider your maidservant a wicked woman, for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief I have spoken until now.”","'Nĕ jơ̆ kơ inh đam ih thoi bơngai drŏ-kăn kư̆ kă, yua kơ inh pơma âu dang ei kơlih kơ jơhngơ̆m inh rŭng răng ơh sơ'ngon."
"Then Eli answered and said, “Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition which you have asked of Him.”","Na Hêli khan, năm mă 'lơ̆ng bĕ krao khan bĕ kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael ăn kơ ih tơdrong ih krao apinh sư."
"And she said, “Let your maidservant find favor in your sight.” So the woman went her way and ate, and her face was no longer sad.","Sư drơ̆ng, apinh ih ăn kơ inh đam drŏ-kăn ih đei mơnat 'bơ̆t anăp ih. Na Hana wih brŏk păng sŏng sa, muh măt sư ưh pă sơ'ngon bơih."
"Then they rose early in the morning and worshiped before the LORD, and returned and came to their house at Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her.","Lu sư iung đơ̆ng hrôih drap kơkuh 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang; đơ̆ng noh lu sư wih brŏk tơ hnam lu sư tơ pơlei Rama. Êlkana oei hơdai hăm akăn sư Hana, Kră Yang 'blŏk kơ sư."
"So it came to pass in the process of time that Hannah conceived and bore a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, “Because I have asked for him from the LORD.”","Na truh tơ Hana anăp na tơpŭ kơ minh 'nu kon drŏ-nglo. Krao anăn sư Samuel,b yua kơ sư đei khan, inh đei apinh bơih sư đơ̆ng Kră Yang."
"Now the man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice and his vow.","Êlkana păng đĭ-đăng hnam dơnŏ sư tŏk năm wă pơyơ̆r kơ Kră Yang tơmam soi lăm rim sơnăm, wă pơsĭt tơdrong sư đei pơkă bơih."
"But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, “Not until the child is weaned; then I will take him, that he may appear before the LORD and remain there forever.”","Mă-lei Hana ưh kơ tŏk năm hơdai ôh, sư khan kơ klo sư, gô kon hơ'lơ̆p lê̆ mŏ, inh gô năm chông ba sư, wă kơ sư năm 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang păng oei hloi tơ noh ling-lang."
"So Elkanah her husband said to her, “Do what seems best to you; wait until you have weaned him. Only let the LORD establish His word.” Then the woman stayed and nursed her son until she had weaned him.","Êlkana klo sư khan kơ sư, pơm bĕ thoi ih tơchĕng khan 'lơ̆ng. Gô bĕ dĭng tơ sư lê̆ mŏm. Wă kơ apinh Kră Yang pơsĭt nơ̆r ih pơma. Thoi noh sư oei hnam, rong kon drŏ-nglo noh truh tơ sư lê̆ mŏm."
"Now when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bulls, one ephah of flour, and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD in Shiloh. And the child was young.","Truh tơ sư lê̆ mŏm bơih, Hana chông ba kon sư năm hơdai sư. Păng kư̆m dui ba rơmo tơno pêng sơnăm, minh êphac tơpŭng, minh pơm get akar sik hơmu. Sư chông kon sư tơ hnam Kră Yang tơ pơlei Silô. Kon hơ'lơ̆p sư noh oei 'lơ̆p."
"Then they slaughtered a bull, and brought the child to Eli.","Lu sư 'bet pơlôch rơmo noh na chông ba hơ'lơ̆p noh tơ Hêli."
"And she said, “O my lord! As your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood by you here, praying to the LORD.","Păng khan: “Ơ yŏng tơ'ngla inh arih ling-lang ơ yŏng inh, inh bơih bơngai drŏ-kăn mă oei dơ̆ng tơ âu 'bơ̆t anăp ih krao apinh Kră Yang."
"For this child I prayed, and the LORD has granted me my petition which I asked of Him.","Inh krao apinh yua kơ bơngai hơ'lơ̆p âu; Kră Yang ăn bơih tơdrong inh krao apinh sư."
"Therefore I also have lent him to the LORD; as long as he lives he shall be lent to the LORD.” So they worshiped the LORD there.","Na inh pơyơ̆r sư kơ Kră Yang yua; lăm đĭ chăl sư arih dang yơ; sưd noh jing tơmam Kră Yang boih.” Klaih kơ noh lu sư drap kơkuh bơnê kơ Kră Yang tơ noh."
"And Hannah prayed and said: “My heart rejoices in the LORD; My horn is exalted in the LORD. I smile at my enemies, Because I rejoice in Your salvation.","Hana krao apinh păng khan: Jơhngơ̆m inh chơt hiôk lăm Kră Yang; Kră Yang pơm ăn kơ jơhngơ̆m inh hiôk chơt. 'Bơ̆r inh pơma pơgreh khan kơ lu bơngai ayăt kơ inh. Inh chơt hiôk Ih dŏng pơklaih inh."
"“No one is holy like the LORD, For there is none besides You, Nor is there any rock like our God.","Ưh kơ đei bu 'lơ̆ng rơgoh thoi Kră Yang ôh, Ưh kơ đei bu nai thoi Ih; ưh kơ đei tơmo ayơ pĕng lu nhôn thoi Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei."
"“Talk no more so very proudly; Let no arrogance come from your mouth, For the LORD is the God of knowledge; And by Him actions are weighed.","Thôi, 'nĕ pă pơma pơang dêh. 'Nĕ pă ăn tơdrong pơang lĕch đơ̆ng 'bơ̆r ih; Yua kơ Kră Yang bơih 'Bok Kei-Dei băt đi; Sư boih kŏng pơtŏ lăng đĭ tơdrong bơ̆n jang."
"“The bows of the mighty men are broken, And those who stumbled are girded with strength.","Hră lu bơngai kơtang tơgơ̆ bơih, mă-lei lu bơngai tơrăn oei đei jơhngơ̆m pran kơtang."
"Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread, And the hungry have ceased to hunger. Even the barren has borne seven, And she who has many children has become feeble.","Lu bơngai phĭ jơnap athei jang kơ đe wă kơ đei tơmam sa. Mă-lei lu bơngai pơngot pă đei pơngot dơ̆ng. Drŏ-kăn hơwŏng tơpŭ đei tơpơh 'nu kon, Mă-lei drŏ-kăn đei kon lơ bơih oei sơ'ngon."
"“The LORD kills and makes alive; He brings down to the grave and brings up.","Kră Yang ăn lôch păng ăn arih; Sư tơhuŏng bơngai lăm pơlei bơngai lôch păng gô tơiung hơtŏk arih dơ̆ng."
"The LORD makes poor and makes rich; He brings low and lifts up.","Kră Yang ăn kơ đe dơnuh, Păng tơiung đe mơdrŏng; Sư tơjur đe păng kư̆m pôk hơtŏk mơ̆n."
"He raises the poor from the dust And lifts the beggar from the ash heap, To set them among princes And make them inherit the throne of glory. “For the pillars of the earth are the LORD’s, And He has set the world upon them.","Sư rô̆ tơiung bơngai dơnuh đơ̆ng 'mui teh; Sư pơdơ̆ng tơiung lu bơngai kơ'bah đơ̆ng lăm 'mui tơnuh, Wă kơ lu sư dơ̆ng hơdai hăm lu bơngai yŏng pơgơ̆r.

"He will guard the feet of His saints, But the wicked shall be silent in darkness. “For by strength no man shall prevail.","Sư wei-lăng jơ̆ng lu bơngai kiơ̆ Sư tơpăt; Mă-lei lu bơngai kơnê̆ sư gô tơlơ̆ lê̆ lăm măng mu. Kon bơngai ưh kơ kĕ ôh yua tơdrong pran kơdih."
"The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken in pieces; From heaven He will thunder against them. The LORD will judge the ends of the earth. “He will give strength to His king, And exalt the horn of His anointed.”","Ơ! Kră Yang; Ih gô pơrăm lu bơngai ayăt hĕch hoch đĭ.

"Then Elkanah went to his house at Ramah. But the child ministered to the LORD before Eli the priest.","Đơ̆ng noh Êlkana wih brŏk tơ pơlei sư tơ Rama, kon hơ'lơ̆p noh oei tơ noh bơ̆jang kơ Kră Yang 'bơ̆t anăp Hêli 'bok soi."
"Now the sons of Eli were corrupt; they did not know the LORD.","'Bar 'nu kon drŏ-nglo Hêli jing bơngai kơnê̆ tơpă, bre sư ưh kơ băt hli yom kơ Kră Yang."
"And the priests’ custom with the people was that when any man offered a sacrifice, the priest’s servant would come with a three-pronged fleshhook in his hand while the meat was boiling.","Tơdrong juăt lu 'bok soi pơm hăm kon pơlei thoi âu; tơdah đei bu wă pơyơ̆r tơmam soi, lu đĭch đam 'bok soi năm kơplah đe oei pai 'nhĕm, ti sư chĕp chơ'mŏng chơkrơ pêng tŏ hơnĕnh."
"Then he would thrust it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; and the priest would take for himself all that the fleshhook brought up. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.","Sư 'bet lăm gŏ glah, gŏ 'bŭng, gŏ 'bei, dah lăm gŏ teh. 'Nhĕm sĕch ayơ mă đom tơ chơ'mŏng chơkrơ, 'bok soi gô iŏk kơ sư kơdih. Noh tơdrong lu sư pơm hăm kon pơlei Isơrael bơngai bu mă năm tơ pơlei Silô."
"Also, before they burned the fat, the priest’s servant would come and say to the man who sacrificed, “Give meat for roasting to the priest, for he will not take boiled meat from you, but raw.”","Mă adrol kơ wă 'buh rơmă, lu đĭch đam 'bok soi truh khan kơ bơngai wă pơyơ̆r tơmam soi noh, Ăn bĕ 'nhĕm sĕch noh kơ 'bok soi wă phang, yua kơ sư ưh kơ wă iŏk 'nhĕm mă iĕm pai hơtŭk sĭn, sư wă iŏk 'nhĕm oei hơdrih đĕch."
"And if the man said to him, “They should really burn the fat first; then you may take as much as your heart desires,” he would then answer him, “No, but you must give it now; and if not, I will take it by force.”","Tơdah đei bơngai noh khan kơ sư, gô đei 'buh lê̆ rơmă sư adrol 'mơ̆i, na ih gơh iŏk mơ̆ng kơ ih wă, sư khan ưh, ih athei ăn hrei âu hloi, tơdah ưh kơ ăn, kơnh inh gô hơđuh iŏk."
"Therefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD, for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.","Noh tơdrong yoch bre kon drŏ-nglo âu tih tơpă 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang. Yua kơ lu sư pơjăm tơmam soi pơyơ̆r kơ Kră Yang lăng ưh kơ gĭt."
"But Samuel ministered before the LORD, even as a child, wearing a linen ephod.","Gah Samuel bơ̆jang 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, sư oei 'lơ̆p, hrŭk ao Êphôt đe tanh hăm brai se."
"Moreover his mother used to make him a little robe, and bring it to him year by year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.","Rim sơnăm mĕ sư tanh ăn kơ sư minh blah ao tai iĕ, năm ba kơ Samuel, năm hơdai klo sư năm wă pơyơ̆r tơmam soi lăm rim sơnăm."
"And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and say, “The LORD give you descendants from this woman for the loan that was given to the LORD.” Then they would go to their own home.","Hêli sơkat pŭn hiôk ăn kơ Êlkana hăm akăn sư khan, apinh Kră Yang ăn kơ ih kon hơ'lơ̆p păng bơngai drŏ-kăn âu đei kon hơ'lơ̆p plơ̆ng wă tơplih kơ kon sư mă pơjao boih kơ Kră Yang. Đơ̆ng noh bre sư wih brŏk tơ hnam bre sư."
"And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile the child Samuel grew before the LORD.","Kră Yang mơnat kơ Hana, na đei anăp tơpŭ pêng 'nu kon drŏ-nglo păng 'bar 'nu kon drŏ-kăn. Kon tơdăm anăn Samuel rai wơ̆ 'lŏ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang."
"Now Eli was very old; and he heard everything his sons did to all Israel, and how they lay with the women who assembled at the door of the tabernacle of meeting.","Hêli đĭ kră dêh sư kơtơ̆ng kơ tơdrong bre kon drŏ-nglo sư pơm kơ đĭ-đăng lu bơngai Isơrael păng tơdrong lu kon sư 'bĭch hơdai hăm bre bơngai drŏ-kăn bơ̆jang 'bơ̆t anih 'măng Bơsŭn Anih Akŭm."
"So he said to them, “Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all the people.","Sư khan kơ bre kon sư, Liơ lu iĕm pơm tơdrong thoi noh? Inh kơtơ̆ng đe roi pơđâu lăm kon pơlei kơ tơdrong măr iĕm đei pơm."
"No, my sons! For it is not a good report that I hear. You make the LORD’s people transgress.","'Nĕ pă pơm thoi noh, ơ bre kon drŏ-nglo inh, ưh kơ 'lơ̆ng ôh tơdrong inh kơtơ̆ng lu kon pơlei Kră Yang roi pơdah rai să."
"If one man sins against another, God will judge him. But if a man sins against the LORD, who will intercede for him?” Nevertheless they did not heed the voice of their father, because the LORD desired to kill them.","Tơdah minh 'nu bơngai pơm yoch hăm bơngai nai, Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei pơm 'long sơlam bre sư; mă-lei tơdah pơm yoch hăm Kră Yang, bu mă gơh krao tơgŭm sư? Mă-lei bre sư ưh kơ wă mơ̆ng ôh nơ̆r 'bă lu sư; Thoi noh Kră Yang pơlôch bre sư."
"And the child Samuel grew in stature, and in favor both with the LORD and men.","Samuel rai wơ̆ 'lŏ lăm akâu; pơm ăn kơ Kră Yang hăm kon bơngai bơ̆n lăp đon."
"Then a man of God came to Eli and said to him, “Thus says the LORD: ‘Did I not clearly reveal Myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh’s house?","Đei minh 'nu bơngai đơ̆ng Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei năm tơ Hêli păng khan kơ sư, Kră Yang khan boih thoi âu, hăm trŏ kơ Inh đei tơ'bôh bơih Inh kơdih kơ hnam 'bok ih kơplah lu sư oei lăm char Êyiptơ pơm đĭch Pharaôn?"
"Did I not choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be My priest, to offer upon My altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod before Me? And did I not give to the house of your father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?","Inh đei rơih iŏk 'bok sư bơih 'bok ih đơ̆ng lăm adrĕch bơngai Isơrael ăn kơ sư pơm 'bok soi Inh, tŏk tơ chơnang soi Inh, soh pơgang 'bâu phu, hrŭk ao Êphôt 'bơ̆t anăp Inh; Inh kư̆m ăn bơih kơ adrĕch ih dôm tơmam soi 'buh đơ̆ng adrĕch lu bơngai Isơrael."
"Why do you kick at My sacrifice and My offering which I have commanded in My dwelling place, and honor your sons more than Me, to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel My people?’","Thoi yơ mă ih pơjăm tơmam soi 'buh păng tơmam soi phe 'ba pơyơ̆r kơ Inh, tơdrong noh Inh tơtă bơih?

"Therefore the LORD God of Israel says: ‘I said indeed that your house and the house of your father would walk before Me forever.’ But now the LORD says: ‘Far be it from Me; for those who honor Me I will honor, and those who despise Me shall be lightly esteemed.","Lei na Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei khan.

"Behold, the days are coming that I will cut off your arm and the arm of your father’s house, so that there will not be an old man in your house.","'Nâu, đơ̆ng âu tơ anăp Inh gô pơtôch lê̆ lu bơngai oei đơ̆ng pran kơtang đơ̆ng adrĕch ih, hăm lu bơngai đơ̆ng adrĕch 'bok ih.

"And you will see an enemy in My dwelling place, despite all the good which God does for Israel. And there shall not be an old man in your house forever.","Ih gô 'bôh đei tơdrong rŭng răng lăm adrĕch Ih, mă khan đei pơm 'lơ̆ng kơ lu bơngai Isơrael ră mă-lei kư̆m oei ưh kơ đei bu arih dĭng kră lăm adrĕch ih dơ̆ng."
"But any of your men whom I do not cut off from My altar shall consume your eyes and grieve your heart. And all the descendants of your house shall die in the flower of their age.","Inh gô oei lê̆ minh 'nu đơ̆ng lăm adrĕch iĕm, wă kơ oei bơ̆jang tơ chơnang soi inh, mă-lei bơngai noh arih pơmat-tat chhŭr nuih lăm jơhngơ̆m.

"Now this shall be a sign to you that will come upon your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die, both of them.","Tơdrong âu gô truh kơ 'bar 'nu kon drŏ-nglo ih Hopni păng Phinêhas wă tơbăt kơ ih; dôm tơdrong gô trŏ thoi Inh đei khan bre sư gô lôch lăm minh năr."
"Then I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest who shall do according to what is in My heart and in My mind. I will build him a sure house, and he shall walk before My anointed forever.","Na inh gô rơih chă kơ Inh kơdih minh 'nu 'bok soi tơnăp tơpăt, bơngai noh gô pơm lăp kơ jơhngơ̆m Inh; Inh gô ăn kơ sư đei minh adrĕch 'lơ̆ng tơpăt wă kơ pơm 'bok soi ling-lang hloi hăm bơngai mă Inh đei hling đak pơgang 'bâu phu."
"And it shall come to pass that everyone who is left in your house will come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and say, “Please, put me in one of the priestly positions, that I may eat a piece of bread.” ’ ”","Bơngai bu mă oei arih lăm adrĕch ih gô năm apinh minh hlak jên hu păng minh tơpei 'bĕng, na khan, Inh wă apinh ih, tơmơ̆t inh lăm lu 'bok soi wă kơ inh đei 'bĕng sa."
"Now the boy Samuel ministered to the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was rare in those days; there was no widespread revelation.","Samuel oei 'lơ̆p sư bơ̆jang kơ Kră Yang 'bơ̆t anăp Hêli.

"And it came to pass at that time, while Eli was lying down in his place, and when his eyes had begun to grow so dim that he could not see","Hêli măt ưh pă bang, pă 'bôh nhen, lăm minh măng ei, sư 'bĭch tơ anih sư juăt kơ 'bĭch tep."
"and before the lamp of God went out in the tabernacle of the LORD where the ark of God was, and while Samuel was lying down","Ŭnh kơđeng Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ưh tam mă păt, Samuel 'bĭch tep lăm hnam akŭm Kră Yang tơ anih đe dan hom pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei."
"that the LORD called Samuel. And he answered, “Here I am!”","Kră Yang krao Samuel; na sư tơl: Đei inh tơ âu!"
"So he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” And he said, “I did not call; lie down again.” And he went and lay down.","Sư kơdâu năm tơ Hêli khan: Đei inh tơ âu, ih krao inh ah. Hêli khan: Inh ưh kơ đei krao ôh, năm tep dơ̆ng bĕ. Samuel năm tep dơ̆ng."
"Then the LORD called yet again, “Samuel!” So Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” He answered, “I did not call, my son; lie down again.”","Kră Yang krao dơ̆ng: Ơ Samuel!

"(Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, nor was the word of the LORD yet revealed to him.)","Kơplah noh, Samuel tam mă băt kơ nơ̆r Kră Yang; nơ̆r Kră Yang tam mă pơma tơklă 'bơ̆t anăp sư tơ'bôh kơ sư."
"And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. So he arose and went to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you did call me.” Then Eli perceived that the LORD had called the boy.","Kră Yang krao đơ̆ng Samuel wơ̆t mă pêng; sư gruih iung năm tơ Hêli, na khan: Ih krao inh ah? Kơplah noh Hêli băt kơ Kră Yang krao bơngai hơ'lơ̆p noh."
"Therefore Eli said to Samuel, “Go, lie down; and it shall be, if He calls you, that you must say, ‘Speak, LORD, for Your servant hears.’ ” So Samuel went and lay down in his place.","Na Hêli khan kơ Samuel: Ih năm tep wăi. Tơdah đei nơ̆r krao ih dơ̆ng, ih tơl: Ơ Kră Yang, apinh Ih khan bĕ, Inh đĭch Ih oei mơ̆ng! Samuel năm tep tơ anih sư dơ̆ng."
"Now the LORD came and stood and called as at other times, “Samuel! Samuel!” And Samuel answered, “Speak, for Your servant hears.”","Kră Yang năm tơ noh, Sư krao dơ̆ng thoi adrol ki: Ơ Samuel! Ơ Samuel! Samuel drơ̆ng Apinh Ih bơtho khan bĕ, đĭch đam ih oei mơ̆ng!"
"Then the LORD said to Samuel: “Behold, I will do something in Israel at which both ears of everyone who hears it will tingle.","Kră Yang khan kơ Samuel: Inh wă pơm tơ lăm Isơrael minh tơdrong, bơngai bu mơ̆ng 'bar pah đon sư gô hrơ̆ng hreng."
"In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end.","Năr noh, Inh gô pơm 'blep dôm tơdrong thoi inh đei khan lê̆ adrol boih gah hnam dơnŏ Hêli: Đơ̆ng blŭng-a truh tơ tôch."
"For I have told him that I will judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knows, because his sons made themselves vile, and he did not restrain them.","Inh đei khan lê̆ adrol bơih Inh gô phak hnam dơnŏ sư ling-lang, yua kơ sư băt boih bre kon drŏ-nglo sư pơm yoch pơjăm Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei, mă-lei sư ưh kơ găn bre sư."
"And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or offering forever.”","Thoi noh, inh đei pơkă sĭt tơdrong yoch hnam dơnŏ Hêli ưh kơ gơh huai iŏk, mă khan hăm tơmam soi hăm sem dah hăm tơmam soi phe 'ba."
"So Samuel lay down until morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel was afraid to tell Eli the vision.","Samuel tep dĭng truh hơdah, đơ̆ng noh sư pơih 'măng hnam akŭm Kră Yang. Sư hli na ưh kơ pơ̆n roi dôm tơdrong tơ'bôh kơ sư noh kơ Hêli."
"Then Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son!” He answered, “Here I am.”","Mă-lei Hêli krao Samuel: Ơ Samuel, kon dăm năm tơ âu, sư tơl: Đei inh tơ âu."
"And he said, “What is the word that the LORD spoke to you? Please do not hide it from me. God do so to you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of all the things that He said to you.”","Hêli jet: Kră Yang đei pơma bơtho tơdrong kiơ hăm ih? Ih 'nĕ ôn kơ inh ôh. Tơdah ih ôn lăm dôm nơ̆r mă Kră Yang đei pơma dơnuh bơtho hăm ih, apinh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei phak ih mă trăp."
"Then Samuel told him everything, and hid nothing from him. And he said, “It is the LORD. Let Him do what seems good to Him.”","Na Samuel roi đĭ dôm tơdrong, ưh kơ đei ôn kiơ hăm sư. Hêli tơl khan: Sư bơih Kră Yang, apinh Sư pơm dôm tơdrong thoi Sư lăp đon!"
"So Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground.","Samuel wơ̆ 'lŏ gơh hơgei, Kră Yang oei hơdai sư: Kră Yang ưh kơ đei lê̆ minh nơ̆r hơyơ đơ̆ng Sư mă đei pơma boih. Sư gô pơm keh."
"And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew that Samuel had been established as a prophet of the LORD.","Đơ̆ng Đan truh tơ Bêrsêba, đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael băt ngăl kơ Samuel jing 'bok khan lê̆ adrol tơpăt đơ̆ng Kră Yang ăn."
"Then the LORD appeared again in Shiloh. For the LORD revealed Himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.","Kră Yang jur tơ'bôh dơ̆ng akâu Sư tơ kông Silơ, tơ kông Silơ Kră Yang tơ'bôh akâu sư kơdih, jur pơma dơnuh hăm Samuel."
"And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out to battle against the Philistines, and encamped beside Ebenezer; and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.","Samuel roi tơbăt ăn kơ đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael nơ̆r Kră Yang. Isơrael năm blah bơngai Philistin păng anih lu sư oei 'bơ̆t jê̆ Êbênêser, gah Philistin anih lu sư oei jê̆ pơlei Aphek."
"Then the Philistines put themselves in battle array against Israel. And when they joined battle, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men of the army in the field.","Kon pơlei Philistin lu sư gă năm blah Isơrael; Isơrael thuơ kơ đe Philistin păng đei bơngai lôch tơ anih tơblah noh dang puăn-rơbâu 'nu."
"And when the people had come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why has the LORD defeated us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD from Shiloh to us, that when it comes among us it may save us from the hand of our enemies.”","Wă kon pơlei mă oei arih brŏk tơ kơđông linh, lu đe kră Isơrael khan: Yua kơ kiơ năr 'nâu Kră Yang ăn kơ đe Philistin tơblah pơrăm lu bơ̆n?

"So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from there the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, who dwells between the cherubim. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.","Thoi noh, lu sư wơh bơngai năm tơ Silô, tung iŏk Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang Tih Hloh, Tơ'ngla mă oei tơ lăm lu chêrubim.

"And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted so loudly that the earth shook.","Wă Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang tung tơmơ̆t truh tơ lăm kơđông linh, đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael jreo hiôk chơt tih, teh mah pơpơ̆."
"Now when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, “What does the sound of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews mean?” Then they understood that the ark of the LORD had come into the camp.","Kon pơlei Philistin kơtơ̆ng nơ̆r noh, na jet khan: Nơ̆r jreo re hiôk chơt tih lăm kơđông linh lu bơngai Hêbrơ noh kiơ kih? Lu sư kơtơ̆ng băt khan Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang đe 'nao tung truh tơ lăm kơđông."
"So the Philistines were afraid, for they said, “God has come into the camp!” And they said, “Woe to us! For such a thing has never happened before.","Kon pơlei Philistin lu sư hli, lu sư khan: Lu yang 'nao truh lăm kơđông linh. Đơ̆ng noh lu sư ôr khan Răm boih kơ lu bơ̆n!

"Woe to us! Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.","Răm boih kơ lu bơ̆n!

"Be strong and conduct yourselves like men, you Philistines, that you do not become servants of the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Conduct yourselves like men, and fight!”","Ơ bơngai Philistin, mă nuih bĕ, tơblah mă kơtang bĕ! Kơnh hli kơ iĕm pơm đĭch kon pơlei Hêbrơ, thoi lu sư đei pơm đĭch lu iĕm! Athei mă nuih kơtang năm blah bĕ!"
"So the Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated, and every man fled to his tent. There was a very great slaughter, and there fell of Israel thirty thousand foot soldiers.","Kon pơlei Philistin năm tơblah, bơngai Isơrael thuơ kơdâu ôn brŏk tơ bơsŭn lu sư kơdih. Noh bơih jĭ minh tơdrong tơblah thuơ tih dêh; pêng-jĭt rơbâu linh trong teh lôch glơch glach."
"Also the ark of God was captured; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died.","Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei đe blah iŏk, 'bar 'nu kon drŏ-nglo Hêli, Hopni păng Phinêhas, lôch."
"Then a man of Benjamin ran from the battle line the same day, and came to Shiloh with his clothes torn and dirt on his head.","Minh 'nu bơngai Bênjamin kơdâu ôn klĕch đơ̆ng anih tơblah, truh tơ Silô lăm năr noh, sư hek hơbĕn ao hiah đĭ, iŏk 'mui teh săi 'bĕnh kơ kơ̆l wă tơ'bôh đei tơdrong sơ'ngon."
"Now when he came, there was Eli, sitting on a seat by the wayside watching, for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city and told it, all the city cried out.","Lăp bơngai ei truh, Hêli oei hơ-oei kơpal tang-dŏ sư 'bơ̆t cheng trong, răp gô hăm jơhngơ̆m hli tơtăm; Hêli sư hli tơtăm kơ Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei. Wă bơngai noh mơ̆t lăm pơlei roi, đĭ bơngai lăm pơlei bu bu kư̆m ôr hơdrăi."
"When Eli heard the noise of the outcry, he said, “What does the sound of this tumult mean?” And the man came quickly and told Eli.","Hêli kơtơ̆ng 'bơ̆r ôr re na khan: Tơjrông tơjrang kơ kiơ hah? Na bơngai noh hăt hot kơ roi ăn kơ Hêli."
"Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes were so dim that he could not see.","Kơplah noh Hêli đĭ tơsĭn-jĭt tơhngam sơnăm bơih. Măt bơbul, ưh pă gơh 'bôh."
"Then the man said to Eli, “I am he who came from the battle. And I fled today from the battle line.” And he said, “What happened, my son?”","Bơngai noh khan kơ Hêli: Inh âu bơngai mă klĕch đơ̆ng anih tơblah năr âu. Hêli jet khan: Ơ dăm, lei tơdrong truh liơ liơ?"
"So the messenger answered and said, “Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been a great slaughter among the people. Also your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead; and the ark of God has been captured.”","Bơngai noh tơl: Bơngai Isơrael thuơ kơdâu ôn 'bơ̆t anăp kon pơlei Philistin; kon pơlei bơ̆n thuơ tih dêh. Đơ̆ng noh, 'bar 'nu kon drŏ-nglo ih Hopni păng Phinêhas kư̆m lôch păng Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei đe blah iŏk bơih."
"Then it happened, when he made mention of the ark of God, that Eli fell off the seat backward by the side of the gate; and his neck was broken and he died, for the man was old and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.","Wă sư roi truh tơ Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei, Hêli arăng hơron pơ̆k hraih đang đơ̆ng tang-dŏ hơtat kong koi lôch hloi; yua kơ sư đĭ kră trăp trĭn. Sư pơm 'bok sek tơlang đe Isơrael lăm puăn-jĭt sơnăm."
"Now his daughter-in-law, Phinehas’s wife, was with child, due to be delivered; and when she heard the news that the ark of God was captured, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and gave birth, for her labor pains came upon her.","Mŏ mai sư, akăn Phinêhas, oei anăp wă jê̆ rơneh; kơtơ̆ng khan đe blah iŏk Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei păng kơtơ̆ng khan Hêli tơnei sư păng klo sư lôch, na kơtă ei sư jĭ anăp sư pơtăm kŭl-tăng tơpŭ hloi."
"And about the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her, “Do not fear, for you have borne a son.” But she did not answer, nor did she regard it.","'Bơ̆t sư wă jê̆ lôch, lu bơngai drŏ-kăn kơ'mĭn khan: 'Nĕ kơ hli ôh, ih tơpŭ kơ minh 'nu kon drŏ-nglo. Mă-lei sư ưh pă tơl, ưh pă đei kơtơ̆ng kiơ."
"Then she named the child Ichabod, saying, “The glory has departed from Israel!” because the ark of God had been captured and because of her father-in-law and her husband.","Sư anăn kơ kon hơ'lơ̆p sư noh Ikabôt,a wă khan: Tơdrong ư-ang Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei đĭ weh jăk đơ̆ng bơngai Isơrael; Sư pơma noh wă khan gah Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei đe blah iŏk, hăm tơnei păng klo sư lôch."
"And she said, “The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured.”","Sư pơma dơ̆ng: Tơpă, tơdrong ư-ang Kră Yang đe Isơrael đĭ weh boih đơ̆ng bơngai Isơrael yua kơ Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei đe đĭ blah iŏk bơih."
"Then the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ kon pơlei Philistin blah iŏk Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei, đơ̆ng Êbênêser tơ pơlei Asdôt."
"When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon and set it by Dagon.","Đơ̆ng noh, lu sư iŏk Hom Pơgơ̆p 'Bok Kei-Dei tơmơ̆t lăm hnam kơkuh kơ yang Dagôn dan 'bơ̆t jê̆ rup yang Dagôn."
"And when the people of Ashdod arose early in the morning, there was Dagon, fallen on its face to the earth before the ark of the LORD. So they took Dagon and set it in its place again.","Pơgê đơ̆ng rŏng kon pơlei Asdôt lu sư iung đơ̆ng hrôih 'bôh đơ̆ng rup yang Đagơn păk kơmŭ brum 'bơ̆t anăp Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang, Pơgê đơ̆ng rŏng dơ̆ng, lu sư iung đơ̆ng hrôih kư̆m 'bôh rup yang Dagôn păk kơmŭ brum tơ teh 'bơ̆t anăp Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang, mă-lei pơgê noh lăp oei 'bôh pă akâu, kơ̆l păng 'bar pah ti kơtĕch 'bôh tă tơ 'măng."
"And when they arose early the next morning, there was Dagon, fallen on its face to the ground before the ark of the LORD. The head of Dagon and both the palms of its hands were broken off on the threshold; only Dagon’s torso was left of it.","Pơgê đơ̆ng rŏng Asdôt iung đơ̆ng hrôih, 'bôh yang Dagôn 'bĭch kơmŭ brum tơ teh 'bơ̆t anăp Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang, kơ̆l păng 'bar pah ti kơtĕch kơdih phara pha. Klơ̆m lê̆ 'bơ̆t 'măng hnam, oei pă akâu sư đĕch oei 'bơ̆t kơtă ei."
"Therefore neither the priests of Dagon nor any who come into Dagon’s house tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.","Yua kơ thoi ei, truh tơ dang ei, lu 'bok soi tơm Dagôn, mă bu bu wă mơ̆t tơ lăm hnam sư noh, lu sư wer ưh kơ pơ̆n chro jơ̆ng yak trong 'măng ei."
"But the hand of the LORD was heavy on the people of Ashdod, and He ravaged them and struck them with tumors, both Ashdod and its territory.","Ti Kră Yang tuh ăn tơdrong pơmat-tat tih kơ kon pơlei Asdôt, ba tơdrong hli krưp, pơm ăn răm truh tơ lăm lu sư păng lu pơlei oei jê̆ kiơ̆ ei đei, tơdrong jĭ tôch hơbuh."
"And when the men of Ashdod saw how it was, they said, “The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us, for His hand is harsh toward us and Dagon our god.”","Wă kon pơlei Asdôt 'bôh lu sư đei tơdrong truh, lu sư pơma tơduă lu sư khan: Ưh pă gơh lê̆ Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael tơ âu hăm lu bơ̆n dơ̆ng, yua kơ ti Kră Yang ăn tơdrong gleh phak truh tih tơ lu bơ̆n păng tơ yang Dagôn, lu bơ̆n."
"Therefore they sent and gathered to themselves all the lords of the Philistines, and said, “What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?” And they answered, “Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried away to Gath.” So they carried the ark of the God of Israel away.","Lu sư wơh krao akŭm đĭ lu yŏng pơgơ̆r đe Philistin, na jet: Bơ̆n wă pơm liơ hăm Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei đe Isơrael âu?

"So it was, after they had carried it away, that the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great destruction; and He struck the men of the city, both small and great, and tumors broke out on them.","Mă-lei đơ̆ng rŏng kơ đe tung Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei truh tơ pơlei Gat boih Kră Yang phak pơlei ei, ăn đei tơdrong truh kơ lu sư hli rŭng răng.

"Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. So it was, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, “They have brought the ark of the God of Israel to us, to kill us and our people!”","Na, lu sư wơh đe tung ba Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei tơ pơlei Ekrôn, wă Hom Pơgơ̆p noh truh tơ pơlei Ekrôn kon pơlei Ekrôn ôr krao: Đe tung ba Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei đe Isơrael truh tơ bơ̆n wă pơlôch bơ̆n păng kon pơlei pơla lu bơ̆n!"
"So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, “Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go back to its own place, so that it does not kill us and our people.” For there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.","Lu sư wơh krao akŭm lu yŏng pơgơ̆r đe Philistin, na khan: Athei tung ba Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei đe Isơrael, wih ba sư tơ anih sư so lê̆ tơ âu kơnh hli kơ nhôn păng kon pơlei nhôn lôch.

"And the men who did not die were stricken with the tumors, and the cry of the city went up to heaven.","Lu bơngai mă tam mă lôch kư̆m đei jĭ pơtôch đơ̆ng lăm pơlei đei nơ̆r ôr krao truh tơ plĕnh ti"
"Now the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months.","Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang oei tơ lăm char Philistin đei tơpơh khei."
"And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, “What shall we do with the ark of the LORD? Tell us how we should send it to its place.”","Bơngai Philistin krao lu 'bok soi păng 'bok pơjâu, na jet khan: Bơ̆n wă pơm liơ kơ Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang?

"So they said, “If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it empty; but by all means return it to Him with a trespass offering. Then you will be healed, and it will be known to you why His hand is not removed from you.”","Lu sư tơl khan: Tơdah lu iĕm wă ba Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang đe Isơrael wih 'nĕ kơ năm ba hoh đĕch; iĕm athei chĕp ba tơmam soi wă huai iŏk tơdrong glăi, na lu iĕm gơh klaih păng kư̆m băt yua kơ kiơ Sư ăn tơdrong gleh truh ling-lang tơ iĕm noh."
"Then they said, “What is the trespass offering which we shall return to Him?” They answered, “Five golden tumors and five golden rats, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines. For the same plague was on all of you and on your lords.","Lu sư jet: Tơmam soi yă kiơ lu nhôn pơyơ̆r kơ Kră Yang wă kơ huai iŏk đơ̆ng tơdrong glăi?

"Therefore you shall make images of your tumors and images of your rats that ravage the land, and you shall give glory to the God of Israel; perhaps He will lighten His hand from you, from your gods, and from your land.","Pơm bĕ lu rup pơtôch păng lu rup kơne mă oei pơrăm phe 'ba, na lu iĕm pơyơ̆r ư-ang kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei đe Isơrael; Rŏ lăng sư huay pă ăn tơdrong truh phak lu iĕm, lu yang iĕm păng mir 'ba dêh char iĕm."
"Why then do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When He did mighty things among them, did they not let the people go, that they might depart?","Liơ mă lu iĕm oei arăng kơ̆l thoi lu bơngai Êyiptơ păng Pharaôn pơm.

"Now therefore, make a new cart, take two milk cows which have never been yoked, and hitch the cows to the cart; and take their calves home, away from them.","Na dang ei lu iĕm athei pơm minh pơm gre 'nao, rôp 'bar tŏ rơmo yŏng kon oei mŏm tam mă lah tah tơ 'long ăt tah hloi tơ gre mă-lei athei puh tơmơ̆t lê̆ kon iĕ lăm hơdrong, 'nĕ ăn druh kiơ̆ yŏng sư."
"Then take the ark of the LORD and set it on the cart; and put the articles of gold which you are returning to Him as a trespass offering in a chest by its side. Then send it away, and let it go.","Na iĕm tung tah Hom Pơgơ̆p 'Bok Kei-dei tơ lăm gre noh.

"And watch: if it goes up the road to its own territory, to Beth Shemesh, then He has done us this great evil. But if not, then we shall know that it is not His hand that struck us—it happened to us by chance.”","Na lu iĕm lăng hnhoi sư năm; tơdah lu sư năm tơ gah hơdral char sư tơ pơlei Bêt Sêmes, lei 'nâu Kră Yang 'Bok kei-Dei Isơrael boih phak pơrăm bơ̆n; mă-lei tơdah rơmo yak năm trong nai lei ưh kơ trŏ Kră Yang 'bok Kei-Dei phak lu bơ̆n.

"Then the men did so; they took two milk cows and hitched them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home.","Bơngai Philistin pơm kiơ̆ lui, sư rôp 'bar tŏ rơmo yŏng oei tơmŏm kon tah tơmơ̆t tơ gre păng chĭt lê̆ kon sư tơ lăm hơdrong."
"And they set the ark of the LORD on the cart, and the chest with the gold rats and the images of their tumors.","Lu sư tah Hom Pơgơ̆p lăm gre, hăm tah hôp rup pơtôch đek pơm păng maih păng kơne kư̆m pơm păng maih."
"Then the cows headed straight for the road to Beth Shemesh, and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and did not turn aside to the right hand or the left. And the lords of the Philistines went after them to the border of Beth Shemesh.","'Bar tŏ rơmo hor gre yak tơpăt tơ rok trong pơlei Bêt Sêmes, ưh kơ weh tơ 'ma dah tơ 'ngiĕo.

"Now the people of Beth Shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley; and they lifted their eyes and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.","Kon pơlei, pơlei Bêt Sêmes oei kĕch 'ba bơyan lăm thŭng, wă lu sư ngơk lăng 'bôh Hom Pơgơ̆p, lu sư chhôk 'nă tơpă."
"Then the cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh, and stood there; a large stone was there. So they split the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD.","Gre rơmo 'nao wă jê̆ dơ̆ng tơ mir 'bok Jôsuê bơngai pơlei Bêt Sêmes dơ̆ng. Tơ noh đei minh pơm tơmo tih.

"The Levites took down the ark of the LORD and the chest that was with it, in which were the articles of gold, and put them on the large stone. Then the men of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices the same day to the LORD.","Lu bơngai Lêwi iŏk tung tơjur Hom Pơgơ̆p păng hôp tah rup yang păng maih noh dan kơpal tơmo tih noh. Lu bơngai pơlei Bêt Sêmes pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'buh ăn kơ Kră Yang lăm char noh."
"So when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.","Pơđăm 'nu lăm Kră pơgơ̆r 'bôh dôm tơdrong noh, lu sư wih brŏk tơ pơlei Ekrôn hloi lăm năr noh."
"These are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned as a trespass offering to the LORD: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, one for Ekron","'Nâu pơđăm tŏ rup pơtôch pơm hăm maih bơngai Philistin pơyơ̆r ăn kơ Kră Yang pơm tơmam soi huai yoch dơ̆ng glăi.

"and the golden rats, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both fortified cities and country villages, even as far as the large stone of Abel on which they set the ark of the LORD, which stone remains to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh.","Lu rup kơne pơm hăm maih kư̆m asong kơ pơđăm tŏ pơlei kiơ̆ kơ pơđăm 'nu kră pơgơ̆r bơngai Philistin iŏk đơ̆ng pơlei tih kơjăp truh tơ lu pơlei iĕ ataih.

"Then He struck the men of Beth Shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD. He struck fifty thousand and seventy men of the people, and the people lamented because the LORD had struck the people with a great slaughter.","Kră Yang phak kon pơlei Bêt Sêmes yua kơ lu sư pơih lăng tơ lăm Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang. Sư pơlôch tơpơh-jĭt 'nu lăm lu sư. Kon pơlei nhơ̆m hmoi yua kơ Kră Yang phak lu sư tih tơpă."
"And the men of Beth Shemesh said, “Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God? And to whom shall it go up from us?”","Kon pơlei Bêt Sêmes khan: Bu kĕ dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei 'lơ̆ng rơgoh 'nâu? Lu bơ̆n wă năm ba Hom Pơgơ̆p âu đơ̆ng lu bơ̆n kơ bu."
"So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath Jearim, saying, “The Philistines have brought back the ark of the LORD; come down and take it up with you.”","Lu sư wơh bơngai năm khan kơ pơlei Kiriat Jêrim, khan lu bơngai Philistin tung ba pơdrâu boih Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang, jur năm tơ âu tung iŏk kơ lu iĕm bĕ."
"Then the men of Kirjath Jearim came and took the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab on the hill, and consecrated Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD.","Đe Kiriat Jêrim năm tung iŏk Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang, ba tơ hnam Abinađap, tơ kơpal groi, đơ̆ng noh rơih iŏk Êlêasar, kon drŏ-nglo sư, wă wei-lăng Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang."
"So it was that the ark remained in Kirjath Jearim a long time; it was there twenty years. And all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD.","Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang đe ming lê̆ tơ Kiriat Jêrim đunh 'biơ̆ mơ̆n, mah 'bar-jĭt sơnăm, đĭ-đăng đe Isơrael nhơ̆m 'blŏk wih brŏk tơ Kră Yang."
"Then Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, “If you return to the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the foreign gods and the Ashtoreths from among you, and prepare your hearts for the LORD, and serve Him only; and He will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines.”","Samuel khan kơ đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael thoi âu: Tơdah đĭ jơhngơ̆m wih brŏk tơ Kră Yang, iĕm athei hŭt lê̆ lu rup yang bơngai tơmoi păng rup yang drŏ-kăn Astarôt đơ̆ng lăm iĕm, na đĭ jơhngơ̆m kiơ̆ Kră Yang, lăp kơ bơ̆jang kơ minh 'nu Sư đĕch.

"So the children of Israel put away the Baals and the Ashtoreths, and served the LORD only.","Na bơngai Isơrael klơ̆m hŭt lu yang Baal păng rup yang Astarôt, kơkuh kơ minh 'nu Kră Yang đĕch."
"And Samuel said, “Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray to the LORD for you.”","Đơ̆ng noh Samuel khan: Athei krao akŭm đĭ bơngai Isơrael tơ pơlei Mispa, inh gô krao apinh Kră Yang tơgŭm ăn kơ lu iĕm."
"So they gathered together at Mizpah, drew water, and poured it out before the LORD. And they fasted that day, and said there, “We have sinned against the LORD.” And Samuel judged the children of Israel at Mizpah.","Lu sư akŭm đĭ tơ Mispa, chhŏ đak păng tuh đak noh 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang.

"Now when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel had gathered together at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard of it, they were afraid of the Philistines.","Wă lu bơngai Philistin kơtơ̆ng khan lu bơngai Isơrael akŭm tơ Mispa, na lu yŏng pơgơ̆r lu sư năm blah bơngai Isơrael, lu bơngai Isơrael kơtơ̆ng khan tơdrong âu, lu sư hli kơ lu bơngai Philistin."
"So the children of Israel said to Samuel, “Do not cease to cry out to the LORD our God for us, that He may save us from the hand of the Philistines.”","Na khan kơ Samuel khan: Apinh ih krao khan kơ Kră Yang ling-lang, wă kơ Sư dŏng pơklaih nhôn đơ̆ng ti bơngai Philistin."
"And Samuel took a suckling lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the LORD. Then Samuel cried out to the LORD for Israel, and the LORD answered him.","Samuel rôp minh pơm triu kon oei mŏm, pơyơ̆r pơm tơmam soi 'buh kơ Kră Yang. Sư krao khan apinh Kră Yang; Kră Yang tơl nơ̆r sư."
"Now as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel. But the LORD thundered with a loud thunder upon the Philistines that day, and so confused them that they were overcome before Israel.","Kơplah Samuel oei pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'buh lu bơngai Philistin năm blah lu bơngai Isơrael.

"And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, and drove them back as far as below Beth Car.","Lu bơngai Isơrael lĕch đơ̆ng Mispa druh blah bơngai Philistin truh tơ ala kơ pơlei Bêtkar đei pơlôch lơ bơngai."
"Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen, and called its name Ebenezer, saying, “Thus far the LORD has helped us.”","Samuel iŏk pơdơ̆ng minh pơm tơmo tih dan 'bơ̆t sơlam Mispa păng Sen, sư anăn Êbênêser.a Sư khan: Kră Yang đei tơgŭm lu bơ̆n truh tơ âu."
"So the Philistines were subdued, and they did not come anymore into the territory of Israel. And the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.","Philistin thuơ bơih, ưh pă pơ̆n tơgar iŏk teh đơ̆ng bơngai Isơrael dơ̆ng. Đĭ chăl arih Samuel, ti Kră Yang găn ưh kơ ăn bơngai Philistin tơgar iŏk dơ̆ng."
"Then the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron to Gath; and Israel recovered its territory from the hands of the Philistines. Also there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.","Lu pơlei mă bơngai Philistin đei blah iŏk đơ̆ng bơngai Isơrael đơ̆ng pơlei Ekrôn truh tơ pơlei Gat, lu sư pơdrâu đĭ kơ bơngai Isơrael; bơngai Isơrael đei iŏk teh noh đơ̆ng bơngai Philistin pơgơ̆r na đei tơdrong rơngei oei hiôk-hian bơngai Isơrael hăm bơngai Amôrit."
"And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.","Samuel pơgơ̆r păng pơm 'bok sek tơlang kơ bơngai Isơrael đĭ chăl arih sư."
"He went from year to year on a circuit to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah, and judged Israel in all those places.","Rim sơnăm sư chă dăr jơ̆p kơ pơlei tih Bethel, Gilgal păng Mispa chă sek tơlang ăn kơ kon pơlei pơla bơngai Isơrael tơ lăm lu pơlei noh."
"But he always returned to Ramah, for his home was there. There he judged Israel, and there he built an altar to the LORD.","Na sư wih brŏk tơ pơlei Rama, anih hnam sư oei. Tơ noh sư kư̆m sek tơlang kơ kon pơlei Isơrael păng pơm chơnang soi kơkuh kơ Kră Yang."
"Now it came to pass when Samuel was old that he made his sons judges over Israel.","Kơplah Samuel đĭ kră bơih, na pơjao ăn kơ lu kon drŏ-nglo sư pơgơ̆r pơm 'bok sek tơlang kơ bơngai Isơrael."
"The name of his firstborn was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah; they were judges in Beersheba.","Kon kơdră sư anăn Jôel păng kon mă 'bar sư anăn Abija, bre sư pơm 'bok sek tơlang tơ lăm pơlei Bêrsêba."
"But his sons did not walk in his ways; they turned aside after dishonest gain, took bribes, and perverted justice.","Mă-lei 'bar 'nu kon drŏ-nglo sư ưh kơ rok kiơ̆ 'bă bre sư ôh, bre sư hưch ham kơ jên tơmam, pơgâm sa tơmam đe păng sek ưh kơ tơpăt."
"Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah","Na đĭ-đăng lu yŏng kră pơgơ̆r bơngai Isơrael akŭm băl, năm chă Samuel tơ hnam Sư tơ pơlei Rama"
"and said to him, “Look, you are old, and your sons do not walk in your ways. Now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.”","Lu sư khan kơ sư: Ih đĭ kră pă kĕ bơih na bre kon drŏ-nglo ih ưh kơ rok thoi ih.

"But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, “Give us a king to judge us.” So Samuel prayed to the LORD.","Kơtơ̆ng nơ̆r lu sư apinh: Ăn bĕ kơ lu nhôn minh 'nu pơtao wă pơgơ̆r lu nhôn, nơ̆r noh Samuel ưh kơ lap đon ôh; na Samuel krao khan apinh Kră Yang."
"And the LORD said to Samuel, “Heed the voice of the people in all that they say to you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected Me, that I should not reign over them.","Kră Yang tơl Samuel khan: Ih athei pơm kiơ̆ dôm nơ̆r kon pơlei apinh ih; noh ưh kơ sĭ lu sư sơngah kơ ih ôh, noh lu sư sơngah kơ Inh, ưh kơ wă kơ Inh pơm pơtao wei-lăng pơgơ̆r lu sư dơ̆ng."
"According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt, even to this day—with which they have forsaken Me and served other gods—so they are doing to you also.","Lu sư pơm kơ ih kư̆m thoi lu sư juăt kơ pơm kơ Inh iŏk đơ̆ng năr Inh pơklaih lu sư lĕch đơ̆ng dêh char Êyiptơ truh tơ dang ei, lu sư achăng lê̆ inh na kơkuh kơ yang nai."
"Now therefore, heed their voice. However, you shall solemnly forewarn them, and show them the behavior of the king who will reign over them.”","Na dang ei, ih athei mơ̆ng nơ̆r lu sư, mă-lei ih 'nĕ hiơt pơma mă trŏ mă 'lơ̆ng păng tơbăt kơ lu sư băt kơ pơtao mă wă pơgơ̆r lu sư noh gô liơ kơnh."
"So Samuel told all the words of the LORD to the people who asked him for a king.","Samuel roi ăn kơ kon pơlei dôm nơ̆r Kră Yang đei khan gah tơdrong lu sư đei apinh sư wă kơ đei pơtao"
"And he said, “This will be the behavior of the king who will reign over you: He will take your sons and appoint them for his own chariots and to be his horsemen, and some will run before his chariots.","na khan: 'Nâu tơdrong mă pơtao iĕm gô pơgơ̆r lu iĕm.

"He will appoint captains over his thousands and captains over his fifties, will set some to plow his ground and reap his harvest, and some to make his weapons of war and equipment for his chariots.","Sư gô ăn pơm yŏng kơ rơbâu 'nu linh păng pơm yŏng kơ pơđăm-jĭt 'nu, dah rôp lu sư choh chŭn sư, kĕch kơ sư 'ba, hơjơ̆m tơmam tơblah ăn kơ sư păng lu tơmam pơm gre aseh tơblah."
"He will take your daughters to be perfumers, cooks, and bakers.","Sư gô rôp kon adruh lu iĕm pơm pơgang 'bâu phu kơ sư, pai gŏ ăn kơ sư păng thơ̆ pơm 'bĕng mi kơ sư."
"And he will take the best of your fields, your vineyards, and your olive groves, and give them to his servants.","Sư gô iŏk mir chŭn, pơgar hơmu păng mir 'long ôliwơ mă 'lơ̆ng hloh đơ̆ng lu iĕm, na ăn kơ đĭch đam sư."
"He will take a tenth of your grain and your vintage, and give it to his officers and servants.","Sư gô iŏk thuê̆ minh lăm mơjĭt đơ̆ng chŭn mir iĕm păng pơgar hơmu lu iĕm na asong ăn kơ lu pơm 'bok kuan păng đĭch đam sư."
"And he will take your male servants, your female servants, your finest young men, and your donkeys, and put them to his work.","Sư gô rôp lu đĭch đam drŏ-nglo, drŏ-kăn, lu adruh tơdăm mă pran kơtang đơ̆ng lu iĕm, truh tơ mah rôp iŏk rơmo aseh iĕ iĕm yua lăm tơdrong jang sư."
"He will take a tenth of your sheep. And you will be his servants.","Sư gô iŏk thuê̆ minh lăm mơjĭt gah bơbe triu lu iĕm păng lu iĕm gô pơm đĭch đam kơ sư."
"And you will cry out in that day because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, and the LORD will not hear you in that day.”","Kơplah ei kơnh lu iĕm gô ôr krao yua kơ đơ̆ng pơtao mă iĕm đei rơih iŏk noh, mă-lei Kră Yang ưh kơ wă mơ̆ng nơ̆r lu iĕm ôh."
"Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, “No, but we will have a king over us","Kon pơlei sơngah ưh kơ wă mơ̆ng nơ̆r Samuel, na khan: Ưh ôh, wă kơ đei minh 'nu pơtao pơgơ̆r lu nhôn."
"that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles.”","Lu nhôn wă kơ đei pơtao thoi lu adrĕch nai; pơtao pơgơ̆r lu nhôn gô năm adrol kơ lu nhôn, na tơblah ăn kơ lu nhôn."
"And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he repeated them in the hearing of the LORD.","Samuel mơ̆ng dôm nơ̆r lu kon pơlei pơla, na sư krao khan roi ăn kơ Kră Yang."
"So the LORD said to Samuel, “Heed their voice, and make them a king.” And Samuel said to the men of Israel, “Every man go to his city.”","Kră Yang drơ̆ng nơ̆r Samuel: Athei chu kiơ̆ dôm nơ̆r lu sư păng ăn kơ lu sư minh 'nu pơtao.

"There was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.","Kơplah ei, đei minh 'nu adrĕch Bênjamin, anăn sư Kis, kon drŏ-nglo Abiel, sâu tơm Sêrôr, sâu Bêkơrat, sâu ach Aphia, adrĕch bơngai Bênjamin."
"And he had a choice and handsome son whose name was Saul. There was not a more handsome person than he among the children of Israel. From his shoulders upward he was taller than any of the people.","Kis đei kon drŏ-nglo, anăn sư Sôl, sư oei tơdăm kư̆m 'lơ̆ng hơbŏ.

"Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul’s father, were lost. And Kish said to his son Saul, “Please take one of the servants with you, and arise, go and look for the donkeys.”","Kis đei lu aseh iĕ akăn wơ̆l jrok. Kis khan kơ Sôl kon sư: Athei chông ba minh 'nu đĭch đam kiơ̆, năm chă lu aseh iĕ akăn jrok."
"So he passed through the mountains of Ephraim and through the land of Shalisha, but they did not find them. Then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and they were not there. Then he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they did not find them.","Sư năm chă jơ̆p kơ kông groi Êphraim, jơ̆p kơ tơring Salisa ră, mă-lei ưh kơ 'bôh; na sư năm dơ̆ng jơ̆p kơ tơring Salim, jơ̆p kơ dêh Bênjamin, mă-lei kư̆m oei ưh kơ 'bôh 'mơ̆i."
"When they had come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, “Come, let us return, lest my father cease caring about the donkeys and become worried about us.”","Sư năm truh tơ tơring Sup, Sôl khan kơ đam mă kiơ̆ sư ei: Thôi bĕ ba wih brŏk đĕch, hli kơ 'bă inh tơtăm kơ ba hloh kơ sư tơtăm kơ aseh iĕ noh."
"And he said to him, “Look now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honorable man; all that he says surely comes to pass. So let us go there; perhaps he can show us the way that we should go.”","Bơngai đam ei drơ̆ng Sôl: Mơ̆ng bĕ, lăm pơlei âu đei minh 'nu bơngai Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua, bơngai mă đe pơyom; dôm nơ̆r sư pơma adrol trŏ ngăl ưh kơ layơ glăi.

"Then Saul said to his servant, “But look, if we go, what shall we bring the man? For the bread in our vessels is all gone, and there is no present to bring to the man of God. What do we have?”","Sôl khan kơ đam sư: Mă-lei ba iŏk yă kiơ wă pơyơ̆r ăn kơ sư? Lăm kơdŭng ba tơmam sa ba đĭ bơih, ba ưh pă đei tơmam kiơ wă pơyơ̆r ăn kơ bơngai mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua noh.

"And the servant answered Saul again and said, “Look, I have here at hand one-fourth of a shekel of silver. I will give that to the man of God, to tell us our way.”","Đam sư drơ̆ng dơ̆ng: Kơdih inh oei đei pă pêng gram jên hu, inh gô pơyơ̆r jên hu noh ăn kơ bơngai mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua, na sư gô tơ'bôh ăn kơ ba trong."
"(Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he spoke thus: “Come, let us go to the seer”; for he who is now called a prophet was formerly called a seer.)","Sơ̆ bơngai Isơrael, dah bơngai bu wă krao chă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei, ngăl khan: Bĕ bơ̆n năm tơ'bơ̆p 'bok băt lê̆ adrol; bơngai mă bơ̆n krao 'bok khan lê̆ adrol."
"Then Saul said to his servant, “Well said; come, let us go.” So they went to the city where the man of God was.","Sôl khan kơ đam sư: Trŏ boih bĕ ba năm. Bre sư năm truh tơ pơlei bơngai mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua ei oei."
"As they went up the hill to the city, they met some young women going out to draw water, and said to them, “Is the seer here?”","Kơplah măr sư oei rok trong suan tŏk tơ pơlei, na măr sư tơ'bơ̆p đe hơdruh jur năm sŏ đak, na jet khan: 'Bok mă băt lê̆ adrol hăm tơ âu ưh?"
"And they answered them and said, “Yes, there he is, just ahead of you. Hurry now; for today he came to this city, because there is a sacrifice of the people today on the high place.","Đe hơdruh ei tơl: Đei to, sư tơ anăp măr iĕm.

"As soon as you come into the city, you will surely find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. For the people will not eat until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice; afterward those who are invited will eat. Now therefore, go up, for about this time you will find him.”","Mưh mơ̆t lăm pơlei, măr iĕm tơ'bơ̆p sư ngei adrol kơ sư năm tơ groi wă et sa.

"So they went up to the city. As they were coming into the city, there was Samuel, coming out toward them on his way up to the high place.","Bre sư yak năm 'bơ̆t wă mơ̆t tơ pơlei, na tơ'bơ̆p Samuel wă lĕch năm tơ kơpal kông groi et sa."
"Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear the day before Saul came, saying","Na mă adrol kơ Sôl wă truh tơ noh, Kră Yang khan lê̆ bơih kơ Samuel"
"“Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him commander over My people Israel, that he may save My people from the hand of the Philistines; for I have looked upon My people, because their cry has come to Me.”","Năr dơning, kư̆m lăm jơ 'nâu mơ̆n, inh gô wơh minh 'nu bơngai đơ̆ng lăm dêh Bênjamin năm tơ'bơ̆p ih, ih gô tuh đak pơgang ăn kơ sư pơm pơtao đe Isơrael.

"So when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said to him, “There he is, the man of whom I spoke to you. This one shall reign over My people.”","Kơplah Samuel 'bôh Sôl, Kră Yang khan kơ sư: 'Nâu, bơngai mă Inh đei khan lê̆ kơ ih adrol 'noh bơih bơngai mă wă pơgơ̆r kon pơlei Inh."
"Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, “Please tell me, where is the seer’s house?”","Sôl năm jê̆ Samuel 'bơ̆t 'măng jang pơlei păng khan: Apinh ih tơ'bôh ăn kơ inh bĕ hnam 'bok mă băt lê̆ adrol tơ yơ."
"Samuel answered Saul and said, “I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today; and tomorrow I will let you go and will tell you all that is in your heart.","Samuel tơl: Inh bơih lah 'bok noh.

"But as for your donkeys that were lost three days ago, do not be anxious about them, for they have been found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on you and on all your father’s house?”","Gah lu aseh iĕ akăn mă ih chă ưh kơ 'bôh đĭ pêng năr kơ 'nâu noh, ih 'nĕ pă hiơ̆k yua kơ đei chă 'bôh bơih. Lu bơngai Isơrael hơpơi chă noh bu?

"And Saul answered and said, “Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then do you speak like this to me?”","Sôl drơ̆ng: Inh jĭ minh 'nu adrĕch bơngai Bênjamin minh adrĕch iĕ hloh kơ đĭ-đăng lăm Isơrael; hnam dơnŏ inh jĭ hnam dơnŏ iĕ hloh lăm hnam dơnŏ adrĕch Bênjamin.

"Now Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall, and had them sit in the place of honor among those who were invited; there were about thirty persons.","Samuel chông Sôl păng đam sư mơ̆t lăm anih să, ba bre sư oei 'bơ̆t anih anăp hloh kơ pêng-jĭt 'nu bơngai năm akŭm et sa ei."
"And Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I said to you, ‘Set it apart.’ ”","Samuel khan kơ bơngai pai gŏ: Ih athei hiŏng 'nhĕm sa mă inh ăn kơ ih păng pơkă khan: Athei 'măn lê̆ pha noh."
"So the cook took up the thigh with its upper part and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, “Here it is, what was kept back. It was set apart for you. Eat; for until this time it has been kept for you, since I said I invited the people.” So Saul ate with Samuel that day.","'Bok pai gŏ ei iŏk 'nhĕm sĕch blu na dan 'bơ̆t anăp Sôl.

"When they had come down from the high place into the city, Samuel spoke with Saul on the top of the house.","Na, lu sư brŏk jur đơ̆ng anih akŭm ei mơ̆t tơ pơlei; na Samuel pơma dơnuh hăm Sôl tơ anih tơ kơpal bơbŭng hnam dơnă, Sôl tep hloi tơ noh."
"They arose early; and it was about the dawning of the day that Samuel called to Saul on the top of the house, saying, “Get up, that I may send you on your way.” And Saul arose, and both of them went outside, he and Samuel.","Truh năr đơ̆ng rŏng, kơplah năr wă lĕch, Samuel krao Sôl tơ anih tơ kơpal na khan kơ sư thoi âu: Iung bĕ inh gô ba ih yak năm. Sôl gruih iung, na Samuel păng Sôl bre sư yak năm hơdai."
"As they were going down to the outskirts of the city, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to go on ahead of us.” And he went on. “But you stand here awhile, that I may announce to you the word of God.”","Kơpah yak năm truh tơ hlôi kơ pơlei bơih, Samuel khan kơ Sôl: Ih athei đam ih rai năm adrol kơ ba.

"Then Samuel took a flask of oil and poured it on his head, and kissed him and said: “Is it not because the LORD has anointed you commander over His inheritance?","Samuel iŏk minh gĕl getchai iĕ mong đak rơmă 'bâu phu, na tuh tơ kơ̆l Sôl, đơ̆ng noh chŭm sư păng khan: 'Nâu Kră Yang tuh đak rơmă 'bâu phu kơ ih wă kơ ih pơgơ̆r kon pơlei Sư."
"When you have departed from me today, you will find two men by Rachel’s tomb in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say to you, ‘The donkeys which you went to look for have been found. And now your father has ceased caring about the donkeys and is worrying about you, saying, “What shall I do about my son?” ’","Năr âu adrol wă weh tơklah đơ̆ng inh, ih gô tơ'bơ̆p 'bar 'nu bơngai drŏ-nglo 'bơ̆t bơsat Rachel tơ pơlei Selsa, dêh Bênjamin; bre sư gô khan kơ ih: Lu aseh akăn mă ih chă noh 'bôh bơih; 'nâu 'bă ih ưh pă bơngơ̆t kơ aseh akăn noh dơ̆ng bơih, mă-lei sư bơngơ̆t kơ măr iĕm dơ̆ng na khan: Inh wă pơm liơ kơ kon drŏ-nglo inh âu?"
"Then you shall go on forward from there and come to the terebinth tree of Tabor. There three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you, one carrying three young goats, another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a skin of wine.","Đơ̆ng noh ih kư̆ yak năm, truh tơ tơm 'long kôih Tabôr, ih gô tơ'bơ̆p pêng 'nu năm tơ pơlei Bethel.

"And they will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you shall receive from their hands.","Lu sư gô kơkuh kơ ih păng ăn kơ ih 'bar tŏ 'bĕng. Lei ih athei iŏk đơ̆ng lu sư."
"After that you shall come to the hill of God where the Philistine garrison is. And it will happen, when you have come there to the city, that you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place with a stringed instrument, a tambourine, a flute, and a harp before them; and they will be prophesying.","Đơ̆ng noh ih gô truh tơ Gibêah Elohima, jơ̆ minh pơm anih kơđông đe Philistin; kơplah ih mơ̆t bơih tơ pơlei, ih gô tơ'bơ̆p minh khŭl 'bok khan lê̆ adrol jur đơ̆ng anih kơkuh, lu sư suang reh brŏ dung teh hơgơ̆r iĕ, hlôm 'lal păng reh tĭng-nĭng năm adrol kơ ih; Lu sư gô khan lê̆ adrol."
"Then the Spirit of the LORD will come upon you, and you will prophesy with them and be turned into another man.","Yang bơhngol Kră Yang gô mơ̆t lăm ih gô suang khan lê̆ adrol hăm lu sư, ih gô jing bơngai nai."
"And let it be, when these signs come to you, that you do as the occasion demands; for God is with you.","Kơplah ih 'bôh dôm tơdrong tơdra âu truh, na ih athei pơm kiơ̆ trŏ dôm tơdrong sư tơ'bôh. Ih gô băt Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei oei hơdai ih!"
"You shall go down before me to Gilgal; and surely I will come down to you to offer burnt offerings and make sacrifices of peace offerings. Seven days you shall wait, till I come to you and show you what you should do.”","Đơ̆ng noh, ih athei năm jur adrol kơ Inh tơ Gilgal, inh gô kiơ̆ ih tơ noh wă pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'buh păng tơmam soi băt bơnê.

"So it was, when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, that God gave him another heart; and all those signs came to pass that day.","Lăp Sôl wă weh đơ̆ng Samuel, Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei tơplih jơhngơ̆m Sôl păng dôm tơdrong tơdra đei roi lê̆ adrol đĭ-đăng 'blep trŏ kơ lăm năr noh."
"When they came there to the hill, there was a group of prophets to meet him; then the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.","Wă Sôl truh tơ Gibêah, đei minh khŭl 'bok khan lê̆ adrol sơng sư. Yang Bơhngol Kră Yang mơ̆t lăm sư, sư kư̆m khan lê̆ adrol hơdai lu sư."
"And it happened, when all who knew him formerly saw that he indeed prophesied among the prophets, that the people said to one another, “What is this that has come upon the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?”","Kơplah lu bơngai đêl juăt băt kơ Sôl adrol, 'bôh sư khan lê̆ adrol hăm lu 'bok khan lê̆ adrol, na tơjet dih băl khan: Đei tơdrong kiơ truh kơ kon drŏ-nglo Kis noh kih?

"Then a man from there answered and said, “But who is their father?” Therefore it became a proverb: “Is Saul also among the prophets?”","Đei bơngai lăm Gibêah tơl: 'Bă lu sư bu hah? Na đei nơ̆r đơ̆ng sơ̆ khan: Sôl kư̆m dai bơngai khan lê̆ adrol dah kiơ?"
"And when he had finished prophesying, he went to the high place.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ Sôl ưh pă khan lê̆ adrol, na sư tŏk tơ anih kơjung kơpal groi."
"Then Saul’s uncle said to him and his servant, “Where did you go?” So he said, “To look for the donkeys. When we saw that they were nowhere to be found, we went to Samuel.”","Ma Sôl jet sư păng đam sư: Măr iĕm năm tơ yơ? Sôl drơ̆ng sư: Nhi chă lu aseh iĕ akăn Jrok; ưh kơ 'bôh; na nhi năm apinh Samuel."
"And Saul’s uncle said, “Tell me, please, what Samuel said to you.”","Ma Sôl pơma dơ̆ng: Apinh măr iĕm roi tơbăt kơ inh dôm tơdrong Samuel đei khan kơ măr iĕm."
"So Saul said to his uncle, “He told us plainly that the donkeys had been found.” But about the matter of the kingdom, he did not tell him what Samuel had said.","Sôl roi kơ ma sư: Sư đei roi kơ nhi khan aseh iĕ akăn măr iĕm 'bôh bơih.

"Then Samuel called the people together to the LORD at Mizpah","Samuel krao akŭm đĭ kon pơlei Isơrael năm tơ Kră Yang tơ Mispa"
"and said to the children of Israel, “Thus says the LORD God of Israel: ‘I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all kingdoms and from those who oppressed you.’","na khan kơ bơngai Isơrael: Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei bơngai Isơrael khan thoi âu: Inh đei chông ba bơngai Isơrael lĕch hlôi đơ̆ng Êyiptơ, inh đei dŏng pơklaih lu iĕm đơ̆ng ti đe Êyiptơ păng đơ̆ng ti dôm lu pơtao pơgŏ pơđep lu iĕm."
"But you have today rejected your God, who Himself saved you from all your adversities and your tribulations; and you have said to Him, ‘No, set a king over us!’ Now therefore, present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes and by your clans.”","Mă-lei lu iĕm sơngah kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu iĕm, Tơ'ngla mă dŏng pơklaih iĕm đơ̆ng dôm tơdrong pơmat-tat păng hli hlơt; Lu iĕm đei apinh: Ăn kơ nhôn minh 'nu pơtao wă kơ pơgơ̆r lu nhôn!

"And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was chosen.","Samuel athei đĭ-đăng adrĕch Isơrael năm jê̆, na sư hlang lăng trŏ kơ adrĕch Bênjamin."
"When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was chosen. And Saul the son of Kish was chosen. But when they sought him, he could not be found.","Sư athei adrĕch Bênjamin năm jê̆ pơrĕng kiơ̆ kơtum kơtŏng, đơ̆ng noh hlang trŏ kơ hnam dơnŏ Matri. Đơ̆ng noh hlang lăng trŏ kơ Sôl kon drŏ-nglo Kis.

"Therefore they inquired of the LORD further, “Has the man come here yet?” And the LORD answered, “There he is, hidden among the equipment.”","Na lu sư jet Kră Yang dơ̆ng: Hăm pă đei bu nai năm tơ âu dơ̆ng? Kră Yang tơl: To, sư ôn lăm anih lê̆ tơmam noh."
"So they ran and brought him from there; and when he stood among the people, he was taller than any of the people from his shoulders upward.","Đe kơdâu chă sư tơ noh. Na chông Sôl lĕch năm tơ anăp tŏk-bŏk kon pơlei, sư kơjung hloh kơ đe, đe dang kiơ̆ hơngiĕng sư đĕch."
"And Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see him whom the LORD has chosen, that there is no one like him among all the people?” So all the people shouted and said, “Long live the king!”","Samuel khan kơ kon pơlei: Lu iĕm lăng 'nâu bơngai mă Kră Yang rơih iŏk?

"Then Samuel explained to the people the behavior of royalty, and wrote it in a book and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.","Samuel bơtho tơ'bôh tơdrong juăt kơ pơtao 'bơ̆t anăp kon pơlei, chih tơ sơ̆p hla bơar dan 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang.

"And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and valiant men went with him, whose hearts God had touched.","Sôl kư̆m brŏk tơ hnam sư kơdih tơ Gibêah, đei lu linh pran kơtang mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ăn lu sư kư̆m brŏk kiơ̆ Sôl."
"But some rebels said, “How can this man save us?” So they despised him, and brought him no presents. But he held his peace.","Mă-lei đei lu bơngai mơ'nah pơjăm sư khan: Sư 'noh khan wă dŏng tơgŭm yă kiơ đei đăi? Lu sư pơjăm lăng Sôl ưh kơ rơ-a, ưh kơ wă chĕp ăn kơ sư tơmam kiơ ôh.

"Then Nahash the Ammonite came up and encamped against Jabesh Gilead; and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Make a covenant with us, and we will serve you.”","Nahas, pơtao bơngai Ammôn, pơgơ̆r lu linh năm wang dăr pơlei Jabes lăm Gileat. Đĭ-đăng kon pơlei lăm Jabes năm apinh Nahas: Apinh ih ăn kơ nhôn kĭ pơgơ̆p hăm ih, na lu nhôn gô bơ̆jang kơ ih."
"And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, “On this condition I will make a covenant with you, that I may put out all your right eyes, and bring reproach on all Israel.”","Nahas pơtao bơngai Ammôn tơl: Inh gô kĭ pơgơ̆p hăm lu iĕm kiơ̆ thoi âu: Ăp kơ đĭ-đăng lu iĕm ăn kơ inh kuek lê̆ măt minh pah gah 'ma, wă pơm mơlâu kơ đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael."
"Then the elders of Jabesh said to him, “Hold off for seven days, that we may send messengers to all the territory of Israel. And then, if there is no one to save us, we will come out to you.”","Đĭ-đăng lu đe kră pơlei Jabes khan kơ sư: Apinh ih ăn kơ lu nhôn lăm tơpơh năr wă kơ, lu nhôn gô wơh bơngai năm chă khan jơ̆p-jang kon pơlei Isơrael; tơdah ưh kơ đei bu dŏng pơklaih lu nhôn, lei lu nhôn gô kŭp kơ̆l yơ̆r ti kơ ih."
"So the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and told the news in the hearing of the people. And all the people lifted up their voices and wept.","Thoi noh lu bơngai đei wơh ei năm tơ Gibêah, pơlei đe Sôl, roi dôm nơ̆r ei ăn kơ kon pơlei pơla kơtơ̆ng. Đĭ-đăng kon pơlei nhơ̆m ôr."
"Now there was Saul, coming behind the herd from the field; and Saul said, “What troubles the people, that they weep?” And they told him the words of the men of Jabesh.","Kơplah ei, Sôl 'nao wă brŏk đơ̆ng chŭn, năm đơ̆ng rŏng kơ rơmo sư; na sư jet: Iĕm nhơ̆m kơ kiơ hah?

"Then the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard this news, and his anger was greatly aroused.","Lăp Sôl kơtơ̆ng tơdrong noh, sư đei Yang Bơhngol đơ̆ng Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei pơtrŭt sư păng sư hil blĕk ơh dêh."
"So he took a yoke of oxen and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the territory of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, “Whoever does not go out with Saul and Samuel to battle, so it shall be done to his oxen.” And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent.","Sư rôp minh hơgrop rơmo, sư kăt soch lê̆ na wơh bơngai chă asong jơ̆p-jang kơ dêh char Isơrael păng hăm nơ̆r tơbăt: Bơngai bu ưh kơ wă kiơ̆ Sôl păng Samuel, na lu rơmo lu sư kư̆m gô kăt soch thoi noh mơ̆n.

"When he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.","Sôl akŭm lu sư tơ pơlei Bêsek; bơngai Isơrael pêng-hrĕng rơbâu, bơngai Juđa pêng-jĭt rơbâu 'nu."
"And they said to the messengers who came, “Thus you shall say to the men of Jabesh Gilead: ‘Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you shall have help.’ ” Then the messengers came and reported it to the men of Jabesh, and they were glad.","Sư khan kơ bơngai đe wơh năm đơ̆ng pơlei Jabes lăm char Gileat: Năm roi bĕ: 'Năr dơ̆ng tŏ dơning, lu iĕm gô đei tơdrong dŏng pơklaih.

"Therefore the men of Jabesh said, “Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you may do with us whatever seems good to you.”","păng năm khan kơ Nahas pơtao Ammôn: Năr dơning lu nhôn kŭp kơ̆l yơ̆r ti kơ iĕm, lu iĕm wă pơm kiơ kơ lu nhôn mơ̆ng kơ iĕm wă."
"So it was, on the next day, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and killed Ammonites until the heat of the day. And it happened that those who survived were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.","Mă-lei pơgê dơning, Sôl klah asong kon pơlei pơm pêng khŭl, năm blah đe Ammôn păng pơlôch đĭ lu sư dĭng truh tơ 'năr dơ̆ng.

"Then the people said to Samuel, “Who is he who said, ‘Shall Saul reign over us?’ Bring the men, that we may put them to death.”","Kon pơlei apinh Samuel: Đe bu khan: Sôl khan wă pơm pơtao pơgơ̆r bơ̆n hah? Apinh ih pơjao lu bơngai 'noh ăn kơ nhôn pơlôch bĕ."
"But Saul said, “Not a man shall be put to death this day, for today the LORD has accomplished salvation in Israel.”","Mă-lei Sôl tơl lu sư: Năr âu lu bơ̆n ưh kơ gơh pơlôch bu; yua kơ năr âu Kră Yang đĕch ăn kơ bơngai Isơrael đei jơnei tih."
"Then Samuel said to the people, “Come, let us go to Gilgal and renew the kingdom there.”","Samuel khan kơ kon pơlei pơla thoi âu: Bĕ bơ̆n năm tơ Gilgal wă hơmet ming pơk Sôl pơm pơtao."
"So all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal. There they made sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD, and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.","Đĭ-đăng kon pơlei wang năm tơ Gilgal; tơ ei, 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang lu sư pơk Sôl pơm pơtao.

"Now Samuel said to all Israel: “Indeed I have heeded your voice in all that you said to me, and have made a king over you.","Samuel khan kơ đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael: Inh chu kiơ̆ dôm nơ̆r lu iĕm apinh inh; inh đei pơk minh 'nu pơtao wă pơgơ̆r lu iĕm."
"And now here is the king, walking before you; and I am old and grayheaded, and look, my sons are with you.

"Here I am. Witness against me before the LORD and before His anointed: Whose ox have I taken, or whose donkey have I taken, or whom have I cheated?

I will restore it to you.”","Âu inh dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp lu iĕm, 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang păng 'bơ̆t anăp pơtao mă Kră Yang đei tuh đak rơmă pơk pơm pơtao, wă kơ lu iĕm roi pơdah ăn.

"Then he said to them, “The LORD is witness against you, and His anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand.” And they answered, “He is witness.”","Sư khan dơ̆ng: Kră Yang pơm kơdranh kơ iĕm; bơngai mă Sư tuh đak rơmă kư̆m pơm kơdranh kơ iĕm ưh kơ đei 'bôh kiơ lăm ti inh.

"Then Samuel said to the people, “It is the LORD who raised up Moses and Aaron, and who brought your fathers up from the land of Egypt.","Samuel khan kơ kon pơlei pơla: Kră Yang jơ̆ Tơ'ngla rơih Môis păng Arôn, chông ba yă 'bok lu iĕm lĕch đơ̆ng dêh Êyiptơ."
"Now therefore, stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD concerning all the righteous acts of the LORD which He did to you and your fathers","Na dang ei, năm bĕ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, lê̆ inh gô sek tơlang lu iĕm lăm dôm tơdrong 'lơ̆ng tơpăt Kră Yang đei pơm tơgŭm lu iĕm păng yă 'bok lu iĕm."
"When Jacob had gone into Egypt, and your fathers cried out to the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, who brought your fathers out of Egypt and made them dwell in this place.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ Jakôp truh tơ Êyiptơ, yă 'bok lu iĕm đei krao apinh Kră Yang; Kră Yang wơh Môis păng Arôn chông anhăk yă 'bok iĕm sơ̆ lĕch đơ̆ng dêh char Êyiptơ, na ăn kơ lu sư oei tơ dêh char âu."
"And when they forgot the LORD their God, He sold them into the hand of Sisera, commander of the army of Hazor, into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab; and they fought against them.","Mă-lei lu sư hiơt kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu sư, na Sư ăn lu sư kơ Sisêra, yŏng lu linh kơ pơtao đe Hasor, ăn lu sư lăm ti đe Philistin păng ăn kơ pơtao Môap; lu đe noh tơblah pơrăm lu sư."
"Then they cried out to the LORD, and said, ‘We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD and served the Baals and Ashtoreths; but now deliver us from the hand of our enemies, and we will serve You.’","Lu sư ôr krao apinh Kră Yang: Lu nhôn đei pơm yoch, yua kơ lu nhôn achăng lê̆ Kră Yang, na kơkuh kơ yang Baal păng yang Astarôt; dang ei, apinh Ih dŏng pơklaih nhôn đơ̆ng ti bơngai ayăt hăm nhôn, na lu nhôn gô chu kiơ̆ kơ Ih."
"And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, Bedan, Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side; and you dwelt in safety.","Kră Yang wơh hĭ Jêrup Baal, Barak, Jeptha păng Samuel; lu sư dŏng pơklaih lu iĕm đơ̆ng ti lu ayăt tăp dăr kơ lu iĕm, ăn kơ lu iĕm oei arih hiôk-hian."
"And when you saw that Nahash king of the Ammonites came against you, you said to me, ‘No, but a king shall reign over us,’ when the LORD your God was your king.","Mă-lei kơplah iĕm 'bôh Nahas, pơtao đe Ammôn, năm blah lu iĕm, lu iĕm năm khan kơ inh: Ưh ôh; lu nhôn athei đei minh 'nu pơtao pơgơ̆r lu nhôn; mă tơpă sư lăm noh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei bơih pơm pơtao lu iĕm."

"If you fear the LORD and serve Him and obey His voice, and do not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then both you and the king who reigns over you will continue following the LORD your God.","Tơdah lu iĕm hli yom kơ Kră Yang, kơkuh kơ Sư, chu dôm nơ̆r Sư pơma, ưh pă kơchu hăm nơ̆r Sư tơtă athei; tơdah lu iĕm păng pơtao mă pơgơ̆r lu iĕm chu yom Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu iĕm, lei tơpă iĕm gô đei tơdrong pŭn hiôk."

"“Now therefore, stand and see this great thing which the LORD will do before your eyes","Na dang ei iĕm dơ̆ng hreh bĕ, lăng tơdrong tih dêh mă Kră Yang wă pơm 'bơ̆t anăp lu iĕm."
"Is today not the wheat harvest? I will call to the LORD, and He will send thunder and rain, that you may perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking a king for yourselves.”","Năr âu, hăm trŏ kơ bơyan kĕch 'ba mi dah kiơ?

"So Samuel called to the LORD, and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day; and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.","Wă Samuel krao khan kơ Kră Yang; lăm năr noh Kră Yang ăn 'mi grơ̆m glaih; đĭ-đăng kon pơlei hli tơrơ dêh kơ Kră Yang păng Samuel."
"And all the people said to Samuel, “Pray for your servants to the LORD your God, that we may not die; for we have added to all our sins the evil of asking a king for ourselves.”","Đĭ-đăng lu sư khan kơ Samuel: Apinh ih krao khan apinh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ih ăn kơ lu nhôn, wă kơ lu nhôn huay kơ lôch; lu nhôn đei apinh wă kơ đei pơtao noh nhôn pơthim ăn tơdrong yoch kơ lu nhôn."
"Then Samuel said to the people, “Do not fear. You have done all this wickedness; yet do not turn aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart.","Samuel tơl kon pơlei: 'Nĕ kơ hli. Tơpă iĕm đei pơm dôm tơdrong yoch âu; mă-lei 'nĕ kơ achăng Kră Yang, athei đĭ jơhngơ̆m chu kiơ̆ kơ Kră Yang."
"And do not turn aside; for then you would go after empty things which cannot profit or deliver, for they are nothing.","'Nĕ kơ achăng Kră Yang chă kơkuh kơ rup yang hiong răm đĕch, ưh kơ đei yua kiơ, ưh kơ băt pơklaih; yua kơ rup yang jơ̆ hiong răm đĕch."
"For the LORD will not forsake His people, for His great name’s sake, because it has pleased the LORD to make you His people.","Kră Yang yua kơ anăn Sư tih dêh, na Sư ưh kơ achăng lê̆ kon pơlei Sư: Sư wă kơ lu iĕm pơm kon pơlei Sư."
"Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you; but I will teach you the good and the right way.","Gah inh, inh ưh kơ pơdơh kơ krao khan kơ iĕm.

"Only fear the LORD, and serve Him in truth with all your heart; for consider what great things He has done for you.","Athei băt hli yom kơ Kră Yang đĕch, đĭ jơhngơ̆m bơ̆jang kơ Sư; lu iĕm athei 'blŏk dôm tơdrong Sư pơm tih dêh kơ lu iĕm ưh kơ băt dang yơ!"
"But if you still do wickedly, you shall be swept away, both you and your king.”","Mă-lei tơdah lu iĕm hrăn oei pơm kơnê̆ ling-lang, lei lu iĕm păng pơtao lu iĕm tơpă gô hiong răm."
"Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel","Kơplah Sôl pơm pơtao, sư 'nao pêng-jĭt sơnăm. Sư đei pơgơ̆r đe Isơrael 'bar sơnăm bơih"
"Saul chose for himself three thousand men of Israel. Two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in the mountains of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. The rest of the people he sent away, every man to his tent.","Na sư rơih iŏk pêng-rơbâu 'nu, đơ̆ng lăm bơngai Isơrael 'bar-rơbâu 'nu wă kơ oei hơdai sư tơ Mikmas păng tơ groi kông Bethel, oei pă minh-rơbâu 'nu noh oei hăm Jônathan tơ Gibêah lăm dêh Bênjamin. Kon pơlei mă oei oei dôm yơ noh, sư ăn brŏk, rim 'nu brŏk tơ bơsŭn lu sư kơdih."
"And Jonathan attacked the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. Then Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear!”","Jônathan blah kơđông pơlôch yŏng Philistin kơtơ̆ng tơ Gêba. Kon pơlei Philistin băt tơdrong noh. Sôl athei đe hlôm keng jơ̆p kơ tơring, na khan: Kon pơlei Hêbrơ mơ̆ng bĕ!"
"Now all Israel heard it said that Saul had attacked a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel had also become an abomination to the Philistines. And the people were called together to Saul at Gilgal.","Wă đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael kơtơ̆ng bơih kơ Sôl blah kơđông pơlôch yŏng Philistin păng băt kơ Philistin areh ayăt kơ Isơrael. Kơplah ei, Sôl krao akŭm đĭ kon pơlei pơla tơ Gilgal."
"Then the Philistines gathered together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude. And they came up and encamped in Michmash, to the east of Beth Aven.","Bơngai Philistin kư̆m akŭm pơpôi băl wă blah bơngai Isơrael: Lu sư đei pêng-jĭt rơbâu gre, aseh tơdrâu-rơbâu linh hao aseh păng linh yak jơ̆ng lơ thoi lĕ kơ chuơh tơ đak dơsĭ. Lu sư tŏk năm blah, lu sư pơm kơđông 'bơ̆t Mikmas, tơ gah hơlĕch kơ Bêt Awen."
"When the men of Israel saw that they were in danger (for the people were distressed), then the people hid in caves, in thickets, in rocks, in holes, and in pits.","Đe Isơrael mơn 'bôh lu sư hli hơmơt dêh. Yua kơ lu bơngai ayăt tŭn gơhret rai jê̆ bơih. Na lu đe Isơrael kơdâu ôn tơ lăm hơgơp tơmo, lăm bri kơdrơ̆ng lăm sơlŭng păng lăm trôm teh."
"And some of the Hebrews crossed over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was still in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.","Kŭm đei Lu bơngai Hêbrơ tŏk găn kơ đak Krong Jôrđăn, truh tơ tơring Gat păng Gileat. Mă-lei Sôl sư oei kơtă tơ Gilgal, đĭ-đăng kon pơlei kiơ̆ sư hli tơtey ngăl."
"Then he waited seven days, according to the time set by Samuel. But Samuel did not come to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.","Sôl gô truh tơpơh năr, kiơ̆ kơ nơ̆r Samuel pơkă; mă-lei yua kơ Samuel ưh tam truh tơ Gilgal, na kon pơlei tơklah tơklang."
"So Saul said, “Bring a burnt offering and peace offerings here to me.” And he offered the burnt offering.","Sôl khan: Athei ba kơ inh tơmam soi 'buh păng tơmam soi 'blŏk bơnê; na sư pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'buh."
"Now it happened, as soon as he had finished presenting the burnt offering, that Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might greet him.","Lăp kơ sư đang kơ pơyơ̆r na blư kơ Samuel truh. Sôl sư kơdâu lĕch wă sơng kơkuh kơ sư."
"And Samuel said, “What have you done?” Saul said, “When I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that you did not come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered together at Michmash","Samuel jet sư: Ih pơm kiơ boih? Sôl tơl: Inh 'bôh kon pơlei tơklah tơklang achăng lê̆ inh ih ưh kơ năm 'blep kơ năr ih pơkă, bơngai Philistin đĭ hơdrŭm 'bơ̆t Mikmas bơih"
"then I said, ‘The Philistines will now come down on me at Gilgal, and I have not made supplication to the LORD.’ Therefore I felt compelled, and offered a burnt offering.”","na inh hli: Tơpă đe Philistin wă blah inh tơ Gilgal păng inh kư̆m tam mă krao apinh Kră Yang. Yua kơ thoi ei, na inh athei khŏm pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'buh."
"And Samuel said to Saul, “You have done foolishly. You have not kept the commandment of the LORD your God, which He commanded you. For now the LORD would have established your kingdom over Israel forever.","Samuel khan kơ Sôl: Ih ưh kơ wao tơpă, ưh kơ chu nơ̆r Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ih đei tơtă khan lê̆ bơih. Tơdah ih đei chu kiơ̆ nơ̆r Sư, lei Kră Yang gô pơjing dêh char ih kơjăp ling-lang lăm Isơrael"
"But now your kingdom shall not continue. The LORD has sought for Himself a man after His own heart, and the LORD has commanded him to be commander over His people, because you have not kept what the LORD commanded you.”","Mă-lei dang ei, dêh char ih ưh kơ kơjăp ôh.

"Then Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people present with him, about six hundred men.","Samuel iung, lê̆ Gilgal năm truh tơ Gibêah lăm tơring Bênjamin, na Sôl jơ̆ lăng kon pơlei oei hăm sư, dang pă tơdrâu-hrĕng 'nu."
"Saul, Jonathan his son, and the people present with them remained in Gibeah of Benjamin. But the Philistines encamped in Michmash.","Sôl păng Jônathan, kon drŏ-nglo sư, hăm lu linh kiơ̆ sư năm oei tơ Gibêah lăm tơring Bênjamin, mă-lei đe Philistin pơm kơđông oei tơ Mikmas."
"Then raiders came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies. One company turned onto the road to Ophrah, to the land of Shual","Đơ̆ng lăm kơđông Philistin đei minh khŭl linh blah tơgar lĕch klah song pêng khŭl, Minh khŭl năm tơ gah Ophra, lăm dêh Sual"
"another company turned to the road to Beth Horon, and another company turned to the road of the border that overlooks the Valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.","khŭl mă 'bar năm tơ gah pơlei Bêt Hôrôn; mă-lei khŭl mă pêng năm rok trong sơlam, trong noh năm tơ gah kơpal groi tơmang 'bôh tơ thŭng Sêbôim, păng char glă."
"Now there was no blacksmith to be found throughout all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, “Lest the Hebrews make swords or spears.”","Kơplah noh lăm đĭ dêh char Isơrael ưh kơ đei bơngai hơjơ̆m, yua kơ đe Philistin khan bơih: Athei 'nĕ ăn kơ bơngai Hêbrơ hơjơ̆m đao păng hơlă."
"But all the Israelites would go down to the Philistines to sharpen each man’s plowshare, his mattock, his ax, and his sickle","Đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael mưh wă kơ pla 'nhik rơmo, 'nhik choh, sung, wăng săng tơgăk, athei năm chă jang kơ đe Philistin"
"and the charge for a sharpening was a pim for the plowshares, the mattocks, the forks, and the axes, and to set the points of the goads.","păng layơ mă 'nhik, sung, wăng, chơkrơ ưh pă han bơih lu sư năm hơmet tơter tơ bơngai Philistin ngăl. Tơter pat 'nhik rơmo dah 'nhik apah tơhngam gram hu. Pat tơter 'nhik chơkrơ sung, sơnguĕt puh rơmo puăn gram hu."
"So it came about, on the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan. But they were found with Saul and Jonathan his son.","Lei na lăm năr tơblah, kon pơlei mă kiơ̆ Sôl păng Jônathan ưh kơ đei đao păng hơlă, lăp Sôl păng Jônathan, kon drŏ-nglo sư đĕch đei."
"And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.","Minh khŭl linh đe Philistin năm jur tơ trong kuĕl Mikmas."
"Now it happened one day that Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his armor, “Come, let us go over to the Philistines’ garrison that is on the other side.” But he did not tell his father.","Lăm minh năr 'nei, Jônathan, kon drŏ-nglo Sôl, khan kơ bơngai chĕp tơmam tơblah sư Bĕ ba, năm tơ kơđông Philistin, oei tơ gah to. Mă-lei sư ưh kơ roi kơ 'bă sư băt."
"And Saul was sitting in the outskirts of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron. The people who were with him were about six hundred men.","Kơplah 'noh, Sôl oei tơ 'nguaih kơ pơlei Gibêah, ala kơ tơm 'long plei gărnăt, tơ pơlei Migrôn, na lu linh kiơ̆ sư dang tơdrâu-hrĕng 'nu."
"Ahijah the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD’s priest in Shiloh, was wearing an ephod. But the people did not know that Jonathan had gone.","Ahija, kon drŏ-nglo Ahitup, 'nhŏng Ikabôt, kon drŏ-nglo Phinêhas, kon Hêli, pơm 'bok soi kơ Kră Yang tơ Silô kon pơlei ưh kơ băt kơ Jônathan năm."
"Between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines’ garrison, there was a sharp rock on one side and a sharp rock on the other side. And the name of one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.","Jônathan adrin năm wă kơ truh tơ kơđông Philistin, na athei năm rok trong kuĕl sơlam 'bar pah kông tơmo gah âu anăn kông Bôses,a na gah to anăn kông Sêne.b"
"The front of one faced northward opposite Michmash, and the other southward opposite Gibeah.","Kông kơjung tơ gah yă-nơ̆m, tơklă pơlei Mĭkmas, na kông tơ gah gơal, tơklă pơlei Gêba."
"Then Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, “Come, let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised; it may be that the LORD will work for us. For nothing restrains the LORD from saving by many or by few.”","Jônathan khan hăm bơngai chĕp tơmam tơblah sư: Bĕ ba khŏm năm truh tơ kơđông lu bơngai ưh kơ kăt tơdra akar 'noh.c Băt Kră Yang gô tơgŭm kơ ba; ưh kơ đei tơdrong kiơ găn Kră Yang ăn kơ jei bơ̆n mă bơ̆n tŏ sĕt dah lơ."
"So his armorbearer said to him, “Do all that is in your heart. Go then; here I am with you, according to your heart.”","Bơngai chĕp tơmam tơblah sư khan: Pơm bĕ tơdrong ih hơpơi, inh gô kiơ̆ ih tơ 'noh."
"Then Jonathan said, “Very well, let us cross over to these men, and we will show ourselves to them.","Jônathan khan dơ̆ng: 'Nâu, ba athei năm tơ lu bơngai 'noh, tơ'bôh akâu ba ăn kơ lu sư."
"If they say thus to us, ‘Wait until we come to you,’ then we will stand still in our place and not go up to them.","Tơdah lu sư khan: Pơ̆ng tơ noh gô nhôn năm tơ măr iĕm, lei ba gô dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anih ba ưh kơ năm tơ lu sư."
"But if they say thus, ‘Come up to us,’ then we will go up. For the LORD has delivered them into our hand, and this will be a sign to us.”","Na dah lu sư pơma khan: Năm tơ nhôn bĕ; lei ba gô năm; noh băt tơdra kơ Kră Yang gô pơjao lu sư tơ lăm ti ba boih."
"So both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines. And the Philistines said, “Look, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hidden.”","Thoi noh na măr sư năm tơ kơđông bơngai Philistin, tơ'bôh akâu bre sư. Bơngai Philistin pơma tơduă: Lăng to lu bơngai Hêbrơ lĕch đơ̆ng hơgơp tơmo anih mă lu sư ôn."
"Then the men of the garrison called to Jonathan and his armorbearer, and said, “Come up to us, and we will show you something.” Jonathan said to his armorbearer, “Come up after me, for the LORD has delivered them into the hand of Israel.”","Linh lăm kơđông pơma kơ Jônathan hăm bơngai chĕp tơmam tơblah sư 'noh khan: Năm tơ âu bĕ, nhôn tơ'bôh ăn kơ măr iĕm, băt tơdrong Jônathan pơma hăm bơngai chĕp tơmam tơblah sư khan: Kiơ̆ mă jê̆ inh, yua kơ Kră Yang pơjao lu sư tơ lăm ti bơngai Isơrael boih."
"And Jonathan climbed up on his hands and knees with his armorbearer after him; and they fell before Jonathan. And as he came after him, his armorbearer killed them.","Jônathan yua jơ̆ng ti sư hao tŏk tơ kơpal păng bơngai chĕp tơmam tơblah sư tŏk kiơ̆ Jônathan teh bơngai Philistin pơ̆k 'bơ̆t anăp Jônathan păng bơngai chĕp tơmam tơblah sư pơlôch lu sư đĭ."
"That first slaughter which Jonathan and his armorbearer made was about twenty men within about half an acre of land.","'Bơ̆t tơblah 'măng blŭng 'nâu, bre Jônathan pơlôch dang 'bar-jĭt 'nu, lăm anih teh să dang pêng-hrĕng tơdrâu-jĭt hlŏk wơ̆t tor."
"And there was trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people. The garrison and the raiders also trembled; and the earth quaked, so that it was a very great trembling.","Đĭ-đăng linh lăm kơđông dah tơ 'nguaih hli tơrơ ngăl.

"Now the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and there was the multitude, melting away; and they went here and there.","Lu linh gak pơtao Sôl tơ pơlei Gibêah lăm dêh Bênjamin, dai 'bôh kon pơlei Philistin kơdâu tơklah tơklang bơsuơ̆t bơsuăt."
"Then Saul said to the people who were with him, “Now call the roll and see who has gone from us.” And when they had called the roll, surprisingly, Jonathan and his armorbearer were not there.","Sôl khan kơ lu linh oei hơdai sư: Chă lăng lăng đe bu mă weh đơ̆ng anih bơ̆n, lu sư chơchă lăng lăng 'bôh ưh kơ tơm, bre Jônathan hăm bơngai chĕp tơmam tơblah sư."
"And Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the ark of God here” (for at that time the ark of God was with the children of Israel).","Sôl khan kơ Ahija 'bok soi: Chĕp ba Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei tơ âu. Kơplah noh Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei oei tơ noh hăm bơngai Isơrael."
"Now it happened, while Saul talked to the priest, that the noise which was in the camp of the Philistines continued to increase; so Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand.”","Lăm kơplah Sôl oei pơma hăm 'bok soi, lăm kơđông linh Philistin rai tơjrông tơjrang. Sôl khan kơ 'bok soi: 'Nĕ tam mă chĕp."
"Then Saul and all the people who were with him assembled, and they went to the battle; and indeed every man’s sword was against his neighbor, and there was very great confusion.","'Bơ̆t noh, Sôl akŭm đĭ-đăng lu linh oei hơdai sư, năm tơ anih tơblah, na 'bôh bơngai Philistin toh đao pơlôch dih băl bơsuơ̆t bơsuăt krưp dêh."
"Moreover the Hebrews who were with the Philistines before that time, who went up with them into the camp from the surrounding country, they also joined the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.","Lu bơngai Hêbrơ sơ̆ kiơ̆ chu jang kơ bơngai Philistin păng kiơ̆ pơm linh lu sư 'nâu wih akŭm minh đon hăm bơngai Isơrael kiơ̆ Sôl păng Jônathan."
"Likewise all the men of Israel who had hidden in the mountains of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, they also followed hard after them in the battle.","Kơplah 'noh đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael oei ôn lăm groi kông Êphraim, kơtơ̆ng khan bơngai Philistin thuơ kơdâu, kư̆m wang druh blah lu linh ayăt 'noh."
"So the LORD saved Israel that day, and the battle shifted to Beth Aven.","Kră Yang dŏng pơklaih bơngai Isơrael lăm năr 'noh; tơdrong tơblah lanh truh tơ Bêt Awen."
"And the men of Israel were distressed that day, for Saul had placed the people under oath, saying, “Cursed is the man who eats any food until evening, before I have taken vengeance on my enemies.” So none of the people tasted food.","Kŭm lăm năr 'noh, bơngai Isơrael lap pă kĕ boih yua kơ Sôl athei 'blŏk nơ̆r đei pơkă pơkăm: Trŏ kơ hiap pơtê̆ bơngai ayơ mă sa tơmam kiơ adrol kơ 'năr kơsơ̆ huơ huĭnh wă măng, đang adrol kơ inh blah lu bơngai ayăt kơ inh! Yua kơ noh, na đĭ-đăng kon pơlei kơ̆m kơ pơ̆n sa tơmam kiơ hloi."
"Now all the people of the land came to a forest; and there was honey on the ground.","Lăp kon pơlei nơnăm lăm bri đei sal sut kơpal teh."
"And when the people had come into the woods, there was the honey, dripping; but no one put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath.","Kơplah, kon pơlei mơ̆t lăm bri, 'bôh sal sut đei đak sut ro tơ teh ră; kơbĭ bu pơ̆n tôt hơnglâu ti liah tơ 'bơ̆r, yua kơ hli kơ nơ̆r pơkă."
"But Jonathan had not heard his father charge the people with the oath; therefore he stretched out the end of the rod that was in his hand and dipped it in a honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his countenance brightened.","Mă-lei Jônathan ưh kơ băt kơ nơ̆r 'bă sư đei pơkă boih hăm kon pơlei, na sư tôt hăm 'long jra sư tơ sal sut đơ̆ng noh iŏk hăm ti sư liah tơ 'bơ̆r, na măt sư 'blêr rai hơdah."
"Then one of the people said, “Your father strictly charged the people with an oath, saying, ‘Cursed is the man who eats food this day.’ ” And the people were faint.","Đei bơngai lăm kon pơlei khan: 'Bă ih đei pơkă hăm kon pơlei: Trŏ kơ hiap pơtê̆ bơngai bu mă sa tơmam kiơ lăm năr âu.

"But Jonathan said, “My father has troubled the land. Look now, how my countenance has brightened because I tasted a little of this honey.","Jônathan tơl khan: 'Bă inh pơm ăn kơ kon pơlei hơ'ngon; athei lăng măt inh hơdah hơdong dang yơ, yua kơ đơ̆ng inh liah tŏ sĕt đak sut âu."
"How much better if the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found! For now would there not have been a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?”","Ăn dah năr âu kon pơlei mă gơh sa tơmam mă bơ̆n đei tơblah iŏk đơ̆ng bơngai ayăt kơ bơ̆n, lei tơdrong tơblah hăm bơngai Philistin jei bơ̆n hloh loi kơ 'nâu dơ̆ng."
"Now they had driven back the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. So the people were very faint.","Na năr 'noh, bơngai Isơrael blah pơrăm bơngai Philistin đơ̆ng pơlei Mikmas truh tơ Aijalôn."
"And the people rushed on the spoil, and took sheep, oxen, and calves, and slaughtered them on the ground; and the people ate them with the blood.","Kon pơlei pă kĕ kơ pơngot dêh, yoh rôp hloi bơ̆n triu, rơmo, kon rơmo pơlôch đơ̆ng noh sa 'nhĕm hrâu hăm pham 'bơ̆t oei pai."
"Then they told Saul, saying, “Look, the people are sinning against the LORD by eating with the blood!” So he said, “You have dealt treacherously; roll a large stone to me this day.”","Đei bơngai năm roi kơ Sôl: Kon pơlei pơm yoch hăm Kră Yang, sa 'nhĕm hrâu hăm pham.

"Then Saul said, “Disperse yourselves among the people, and say to them, ‘Bring me here every man’s ox and every man’s sheep, slaughter them here, and eat; and do not sin against the LORD by eating with the blood.’ ” So every one of the people brought his ox with him that night, and slaughtered it there.","Sư khan dơ̆ng: Athei năm jơ̆p kơ khŭl lu linh roi tơbăt kơ rim 'nu athei anhăk ba triu rơmo sư tơ inh păng pơlôch tơ âu.

"Then Saul built an altar to the LORD. This was the first altar that he built to the LORD.","Na Sôl pơdơ̆ng hloi minh pơm chơnang soi kơ Kră Yang 'nâu mă blŭng-a mă sư pơm chơnang soi wă kơkuh kơ Kră Yang."
"Now Saul said, “Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and plunder them until the morning light; and let us not leave a man of them.” And they said, “Do whatever seems good to you.” Then the priest said, “Let us draw near to God here.”","Đơ̆ng 'noh Sôl khan: Bơ̆n athei jur druh bơngai Philistin lăm kơmăng âu, blah tơgar pơrăm lu sư dĭng truh pơgê hơdah păng 'nĕ kơ ăn đei minh 'nu bơngai arih. Lu sư khan: Pơm bĕ dôm tơdrong ih khan trŏ. 'Bok soi khan: Bơ̆n athei năm apinh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei."
"So Saul asked counsel of God, “Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will You deliver them into the hand of Israel?” But He did not answer him that day.","Sôl krao apinh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei: Inh hăm gơh jur druh lu bơngai Philistin ưh? Ih hăm pơjao lu sư lăm ti bơngai Isơrael ưh? Mă-lei Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ưh kơ đei tơl lăm năr noh."
"And Saul said, “Come over here, all you chiefs of the people, and know and see what this sin was today.","Sôl khan: Ơ lu 'bok tih mă wei pơgơ̆r kon pơlei, đĭ-đăng athei năm jê̆ tơ âu, chă lăng tơdrong yoch đei pơm lăm năr 'nâu thoi yơ."
"For as the LORD lives, who saves Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die.” But not a man among all the people answered him.","Inh yua anăn Kră Yang arih ling-lang, dŏng pơklaih Isơrael, inh pơkă khan bơngai bu đei pơm yoch, mă Jônathan, kon drŏ-nglo inh kơdih, kư̆m trŏ kơ lôch!

"Then he said to all Israel, “You be on one side, and my son Jonathan and I will be on the other side.” And the people said to Saul, “Do what seems good to you.”","Sư khan hloi kơ đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael: Iĕm athei dơ̆ng gah âu; inh păng Jônathan, kon drŏ-nglo inh, gô dơ̆ng gah to.

"Therefore Saul said to the LORD God of Israel, “Give a perfect lot.” So Saul and Jonathan were taken, but the people escaped.","Sôl krao apinh: Ơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael: Liơ Ih ưh kơ tơl tơwih nơ̆r inh năr âu?

"And Saul said, “Cast lots between my son Jonathan and me.” So Jonathan was taken.","Sôl khan: Athei hlang lăng bĕ wă kơ băt inh dah Jônathan kon drŏ-nglo inh trŏ kơ Jônathan."
"Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done.” And Jonathan told him, and said, “I only tasted a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand. So now I must die!”","Sôl jet Jônathan: Roi bĕ kơ inh băt ih đei pơm kiơ. Jônathan roi tơpăt: Inh đei tôt tơ sal sut hăm 'long jra inh na liah tŏ sĕt; na inh âu trŏ kơ lôch."
"Saul answered, “God do so and more also; for you shall surely die, Jonathan.”","Sôl pơkă: Ơ Jônathan, dah ih ưh kơ lôch, apinh Kră Yang tơjur tơdrong truh trăp dêh kơpal inh!"
"But the people said to Saul, “Shall Jonathan die, who has accomplished this great deliverance in Israel? Certainly not! As the LORD lives, not one hair of his head shall fall to the ground, for he has worked with God this day.” So the people rescued Jonathan, and he did not die.","Mă-lei kon pơlei tơl Sôl khan: Ưh ôh!

"Then Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their own place.","Sôl wih brŏk, ưh kơ đei druh bơngai lu Philistin dơ̆ng; păng bơngai Philistin wơ̆t brŏk tơ dêh sư kơdih."
"So Saul established his sovereignty over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, against the people of Ammon, against Edom, against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he harassed them.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ Sôl pơm pơtao pơgơ̆r teh đak Isơrael, na sư tơblah hăm bơngai ayăt kơ sư puăn pah, wă khan sư tơblah hăm bơngai Môap, Ammôn, Eđôm, lu pơtao Sôba păng hăm bơngai Philistin; sư tơblah tơ yơ, kư̆m jei sư ngăl."
"And he gathered an army and attacked the Amalekites, and delivered Israel from the hands of those who plundered them.","Sư nuih kơtang tơblah bơngai Amalek păng dŏng pơklaih Isơrael đơ̆ng ti bơngai chă blah tơgar iŏk."
"The sons of Saul were Jonathan, Jishui, and Malchishua. And the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal.","Pơtao Sôl đei pêng 'nu kon drŏ-nglo Jônathan, Iswi păng Malkisua, sư kư̆m đei 'bar 'nu kon drŏ-kăn; 'lŏ anăn Mêrap, 'lơ̆p anăn Mikal"
"The name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. And the name of the commander of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle.","Akăn Sôl anăn Ahinôam, kon drŏ-kăn Ahimaas. Yŏng lu linh anăn Apner, kon drŏ-nglo Nêr, sư 'noh ma 'bok Sôl."
"Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.","Kis, 'bă Sôl păng Nêr 'bă Apner kon drŏ-nglo Abiel."
"Now there was fierce war with the Philistines all the days of Saul. And when Saul saw any strong man or any valiant man, he took him for himself.","Đĭ chăl arih Sôl đei tơdrong tơblah tih hơnơ̆ng hăm bơngai Philistin; dah Sôl 'bôh bơngai pran păng nuih kơtang, sư rôp iŏk bơngai 'noh kiơ̆ sư păng jang hăm sư."
"Samuel also said to Saul, “The LORD sent me to anoint you king over His people, over Israel. Now therefore, heed the voice of the words of the LORD.","Samuel khan kơ Sôl: Kră Yang wơh inh boih tuh ăn kơ ih đak rơmă, pơdơ̆ng ih pơm pơtao kon pơlei Isơrael sư. Thoi noh dang ei mơ̆ng bĕ nơ̆r Kră Yang."
"Thus says the LORD of hosts: ‘I will punish Amalek for what he did to Israel, how he ambushed him on the way when he came up from Egypt.","Kră Yang Tih Hloh khan: Inh 'blŏk đơ̆ng tơdrong Amalek pơm kơ lu bơngai Isơrael, găn trong năm kơplah lĕch hlôi đơ̆ng dêh Êyiptơ."
"Now go and attack Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and do not spare them. But kill both man and woman, infant and nursing child, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.’ ”","Thoi noh, na năm bĕ blah kon pơlei Amalek păng pơlôch pơđĭ lu sư sem dơrong lu sư.

"So Saul gathered the people together and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand men of Judah.","Na, Sôl krao pơpôi akŭm kon pơlei pơla tơ pơlei Têliam. Đei 'bar-rơbâu 'nu linh yak jơ̆ng păng mơjĭt-rơbâu 'nu bơngai Juđa."
"And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and lay in wait in the valley.","Sôl năm blah kon pơlei Amalek păng răp lu linh lăm thong."
"Then Saul said to the Kenites, “Go, depart, get down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them. For you showed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up out of Egypt.” So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.","Sôl kư̆m wơh bơngai năm tơbăt ăn kơ kon pơlei Kênit: Lu iĕm athei weh bĕ, tơklah lĕch bĕ đơ̆ng kon pơlei Amalek, wă kơ lu nhôn huay kơ pơlôch iĕm hơdai hăm lu sư, yua kơ lu iĕm pơm 'lơ̆ng kơ kon pơlei Isơrael kơplah lu sư 'nao lĕch hlôi đơ̆ng dêh Êyiptơ.

"And Saul attacked the Amalekites, from Havilah all the way to Shur, which is east of Egypt.","Sôl blah lu bơngai Amalek đơ̆ng Hawila truh tơ Sur tơ gah hơlĕch kơ dêh Êyiptơ jei sư."
"He also took Agag king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.","Sư rôp arih Agak, pơtao lu bơngai Amalek; đơ̆ng noh iŏk đao pơlôch pơđĭ lu kon pơlei pơla."
"But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep, the oxen, the fatlings, the lambs, and all that was good, and were unwilling to utterly destroy them. But everything despised and worthless, that they utterly destroyed.","Sôl păng kon pơlei achăng mơnat kơ Agak, kư̆m ưh kơ đei pơlôch lu sem dơrong mă 'lơ̆ng hloh lăm lu khŭl rơmo dah triu, rong mă bek, kon triu păng dôm lu sem dơrong 'lơ̆ng hloh, mă-lei pơlôch pơđĭ dôm lu kon sem kiơ kơnê̆ păng ưh kơ gĭt."
"Now the word of the LORD came to Samuel, saying","Kră Yang khan kơ Samuel"
"“I greatly regret that I have set up Saul as king, for he has turned back from following Me, and has not performed My commandments.” And it grieved Samuel, and he cried out to the LORD all night.","Inh hmach dêh pôk boih Sôl pơm pơtao; yua kơ sư achăng lê̆ Inh, ưh kơ pơm kiơ̆ nơ̆r Inh. Samuel blĕk krao khan kơ Kră Yang prăt măng."
"So when Samuel rose early in the morning to meet Saul, it was told Samuel, saying, “Saul went to Carmel, and indeed, he set up a monument for himself; and he has gone on around, passed by, and gone down to Gilgal.”","Pơgê năr đơ̆ng rŏng, sư năm tơ'bơ̆p Sôl, đei bơngai năm roi kơ Samuel: Sôl hlôi năm tơ Karmel boih, pơdơ̆ng tơmo wă tơ'blŏk kơ sư; đơ̆ng noh na wih jur tơ Gilgal."
"Then Samuel went to Saul, and Saul said to him, “Blessed are you of the LORD! I have performed the commandment of the LORD.”","Samuel năm tơ'bơ̆p Sôl; Sôl kơkuh kơ sư: Hơpơi kơ Kră Yang ăn pŭn hiôk kơ ih! Inh pơm kiơ̆ boih dôm nơ̆r đơ̆ng Kră Yang tơtă."
"But Samuel said, “What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?”","Samuel jet sư: Thoi noh na triu bơbe hmoi krao ôr kơtơ̆ng truh tơ đon inh, hăm inh kơtơ̆ng rơmo hmoi, noh kiơ?"
"And Saul said, “They have brought them from the Amalekites; for the people spared the best of the sheep and the oxen, to sacrifice to the LORD your God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.”","Sôl tơl: Kon pơlei đei 'mêm rôp dui ba, lu sem dơrong mă 'lơ̆ng, triu bơbe păng rơmo đơ̆ng bơngai Amalek; dui ba sem dơrong 'lơ̆ng hloh triu păng rơmo, wă pơyơ̆r sư pơm tơmam soi ăn kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ih; lu sem dơrong oei đei nhôn pơlôch pơđĭ boih."
"Then Samuel said to Saul, “Be quiet! And I will tell you what the LORD said to me last night.” And he said to him, “Speak on.”","Samuel khan kơ Sôl: Thôi! Gô Inh roi ăn kơ ih dôm tơdrong Kră Yang khan boih kơ inh măng âu Sôl tơl: Roi bĕ."
"So Samuel said, “When you were little in your own eyes, were you not head of the tribes of Israel? And did not the LORD anoint you king over Israel?","Samuel roi khan: Ih adrĕch iĕ ưh kơ hơnhŏ pơm kơ̆l kơ adrĕch adrung bơngai Isơrael dah kiơ? Kră Yang tuh đak rơmă ăn kơ ih pơm pơtao lu bơngai Isơrael."
"Now the LORD sent you on a mission, and said, ‘Go, and utterly destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.’","Na, Kră Yang wơh ih năm na khan: Năm bĕ pơlôch đĭ lu bơngai pơm yoch to, noh kon pơlei Amalek păng tơblah hăm lu sư dĭng truh kơ lu iĕm pơlôch đĭ lu sư."
"Why then did you not obey the voice of the LORD? Why did you swoop down on the spoil, and do evil in the sight of the LORD?”","Liơ ih ưh kơ chu pơm kiơ̆ nơ̆r Kră Yang khan? Liơ ih năm mơ̆t blah tơgar iŏk, pơm dôm tơdrong kơnê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang?"
"And Saul said to Samuel, “But I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and gone on the mission on which the LORD sent me, and brought back Agag king of Amalek; I have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.","Sôl tơl nơ̆r Samuel: Mă-lei inh pơm kiơ̆ nơ̆r Kră Yang khan, inh năm pơm keh boih nơ̆r tơtă Kră Yang wơh inh năm pơm; inh chĕp ba Agak, pơtao bơngai Amalek păng pơlôch pơđĭ lu kon pơlei Amalek."
"But the people took of the plunder, sheep and oxen, the best of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice to the LORD your God in Gilgal.”","Kon pơlei đei rơih iŏk lăm lu tơmam mă đei blah tơgar iŏk, triu bơbe păng rơmo, sem dơrong 'lơ̆ng hloh gah tơmam trŏ kơ pơlôch, wă pơyơ̆r ăn kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ih tơ Gilgal."
"So Samuel said: “Has the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, As in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, And to heed than the fat of rams.","Samuel khan: Kră Yang lăp đon kơ pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'buh noh hloh kơ chu yom kơ nơ̆r Sư dah ưh? Chu yom kiơ̆ nơ̆r 'lơ̆ng hloh kơ tơmam soi, mơ̆ng pơm kiơ̆ 'lơ̆ng hloh kơ rơmă triu tơno."
"For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, And stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, He also has rejected you from being king.”","Hơngah ưh kơ pơm kiơ̆ noh kư̆m yoch thoi bơngai pơjâu hơlĕnh; Pơang kư̆m yoch thoi kơkuh kơ rup yang.

"Then Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned, for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD and your words, because I feared the people and obeyed their voice.","Sôl chu iŏk nơ̆r Samuel khan: Inh đei pơm yoch boih ưh kơ wă chu nơ̆r Kră Yang tơtă păng đơ̆ng nơ̆r ih bơtho khan.

"Now therefore, please pardon my sin, and return with me, that I may worship the LORD.”","Dang ei, apinh ih mơnat kơ tơdrong yoch inh, jơ̆ inh dơ̆ng hăm wih kiơ̆ inh, na inh gô drap kơkuh 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang."
"But Samuel said to Saul, “I will not return with you, for you have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you from being king over Israel.”","Samuel khan hăm Sôl: Inh ưh pă wih tơ jê̆ ih dơ̆ng; yua kơ ih achăng lê̆ nơ̆r Kră Yang, na Kră Yang kư̆m achăng lê̆ ih, ưh kơ pă wă ih pơm pơtao lu bơngai Isơrael dơ̆ng."
"And as Samuel turned around to go away, Saul seized the edge of his robe, and it tore.","Samuel wih rŏng wă năm, Sôl rôp tơdrơi ao sư, na ao hiah hloi."
"So Samuel said to him, “The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today, and has given it to a neighbor of yours, who is better than you.","Samuel khan kơ sư: Năr 'nâu Kră Yang kư̆m hek teh đak Isơrael đơ̆ng ih kư̆m thoi noh mơ̆n, na pơjao ăn kơ bơngai nai đơ̆ng, trŏ hloh kơ ih."
"And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor relent. For He is not a man, that He should relent.”","Hloh kơ noh Kră Yang arih ling-lang lu bơngai Isơrael ưh kơ pơma hơlĕnh, kư̆m ưh kơ tơplih nơ̆r; yua kơ ưh kơ trŏ kơ kon bơngai na mă tơplih nơ̆r!"
"Then he said, “I have sinned; yet honor me now, please, before the elders of my people and before Israel, and return with me, that I may worship the LORD your God.”","Sôl apinh lung: Inh đei yoch; mă-lei apinh ih pơyom kơ inh 'bơ̆t anăp lu đe kră wei-lăng kon pơlei inh păng 'bơ̆t anăp lu bơngai Isơrael; apinh ih wih jơ̆ inh dơ̆ng na inh gô kơkuh kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ih."
"So Samuel turned back after Saul, and Saul worshiped the LORD.","Samuel wih jơ̆ dơ̆ng Sôl kiơ̆ thoi sư pơkă; na Sôl drap kơkuh kơ Kră Yang."
"Then Samuel said, “Bring Agag king of the Amalekites here to me.” So Agag came to him cautiously. And Agag said, “Surely the bitterness of death is past.”","Samuel khan: Chông ba Agak, pơtao bơngai Amalek năm tơ inh: Agak năm hơdar hơdêh truh tơ sư, tơchĕng lăm to khan: Tơdrong lôch pơmat-tat hlôi boih."
"But Samuel said, “As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women.” And Samuel hacked Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.","Mă-lei Samuel khan: Dah đao ih pơm boih kơ bơngai drŏ-kăn hiong kon thoi yơ, na mĕ ih kư̆m gô hiong kon thoi noh mơ̆n. Đang kơ pơma, Samuel pơlôch hloi Agak 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang tơ Gilgal."
"Then Samuel went to Ramah, and Saul went up to his house at Gibeah of Saul.","Na, Samuel wih brŏk tơ Rama; gah Sôl brŏk tơ hnam sư kơdih tơ Gibêah."
"And Samuel went no more to see Saul until the day of his death. Nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul, and the LORD regretted that He had made Saul king over Israel.","Samuel ưh pă 'bôh Sôl dơ̆ng truh tơ năr sư lôch; yua kơ sư sơ'ngon dêh gah tơdrong jang Sôl; gah Kră Yang hmach dêh đei pơk Sôl pơm pơtao lu bơngai Isơrael."
"Now the LORD said to Samuel, “How long will you mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and go; I am sending you to Jesse the Bethlehemite. For I have provided Myself a king among his sons.”","Kră Yang khan kơ Samuel: Ih oei sơ'ngon kơ Sôl dĭng truh dang yơ? Inh achăng lê̆ sư boih, ưh pă ăn sư pơm pơtao bơngai Isơrael dơ̆ng.

"And Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me.” But the LORD said, “Take a heifer with you, and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.’","Samuel tơl: Liơ inh gơh năm tơ noh? Dah Sôl băt, sư gô pơlôch inh. Kră Yang khan: Ih dui ba minh pơm rơmo akăn adruh, na khan: Inh pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'buh ăn kơ Kră Yang."
"Then invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do; you shall anoint for Me the one I name to you.”","Ih krao Jese dai năm mơ̆n. Inh gô bơtho ăn kơ ih băt tơdrong kiơ ih gô pơm, Inh tơ'bôh ăn kơ ih bơngai bu ih gô tuh đak rơmă wă pơk sư pơm pơtao bơ̆jang kơ Inh."
"So Samuel did what the LORD said, and went to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, “Do you come peaceably?”","Samuel pơm kiơ̆ dôm tơdrong Kră Yang bơtho khan kơ sư, năm truh tơ pơlei Betlehem. Lu kră pơlei tơkan sơng sư.

"And he said, “Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to the LORD. Sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.” Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons, and invited them to the sacrifice.","Na sư tơl: Hiôk-hian Inh truh tơ âu wă pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'buh kơ Kră Yang; hơmet bĕ kơdih akâu mă 'lơ̆ng rơgoh păng kư̆m wang năm tơ âu hơdai inh.

"So it was, when they came, that he looked at Eliab and said, “Surely the LORD’s anointed is before Him!”","Wă Jese hăm lu kon sư truh, Samuel 'bôh Êliap, na tơchĕng lăm to khan: 'Nâu boih bơngai mă wă tuh đak rơmă đơ̆ng Kră Yang mă oei dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp Sư."
"But the LORD said to Samuel, “Do not look at his appearance or at his physical stature, because I have refused him. For the LORD does not see as man sees; for man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.”","Mă-lei Kră Yang khan kơ Samuel; 'Nĕ kơ lăng akâu rŏ hơbŏ tih bơngai noh, Inh ưh kơ iŏk sư.

"So Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, “Neither has the LORD chosen this one.”","Jese krao Abinađap păng athei sư năm 'bơ̆t anăp Samuel; mă-lei Samuel khan: Kră Yang kư̆m ưh kơ rơih iŏk bơngai 'nâu."
"Then Jesse made Shammah pass by. And he said, “Neither has the LORD chosen this one.”","Jese athei Samma năm 'bơ̆t anăp Samuel mă-lei Samuel khan: Kră Yang kư̆m ưh kơ rơih iŏk bơngai 'nâu mơ̆n."
"Thus Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, “The LORD has not chosen these.”","Jese athei tơpơh 'nu kon drŏ-nglo sư kơdih năm 'bơ̆t anăp Samuel lei-lăi thoi noh; na Samuel khan kơ Jese thoi âu: Kră Yang ưh kơ rơih iŏk minh 'nu bơngai bu lăm đe noh."
"And Samuel said to Jesse, “Are all the young men here?” Then he said, “There remains yet the youngest, and there he is, keeping the sheep.” And Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and bring him. For we will not sit down till he comes here.”","Đơ̆ng noh, Samuel apinh Jese dơ̆ng: Kon drŏ-nglo ih đĭ dôm noh boih hă? Jese tơl thoi âu: Oei pă minh 'nu kon hơdruch inh, mă-lei sư oei wei triu.

"So he sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, with bright eyes, and good-looking. And the LORD said, “Arise, anoint him; for this is the one!”","Na, Jese năm wơh bơngai năm krao iŏk sư. Muh măt akâu jăn sư hơbŏ 'lơ̆ng. Kră Yang khan kơ Samuel: 'Nâu boih; iung bĕ tuh đak rơmă kơ sư."
"Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel arose and went to Ramah.","Samuel iŏk hơke đak rơmă, tuh ăn kơ Đawit mă oei tơm măt lu 'nhŏng oh sư. 'Bơ̆t noh hloi Yang Bơhngol 'Lơ̆ng Kră Yang oei hơdai Đawit ling-lang hloi.

"But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and a distressing spirit from the LORD troubled him.","Yang Bơhngol 'Lơ̆ng Kră Yang lĕch đơ̆ng Sôl; Kră Yang wơh minh 'nu yang kơnê̆ pơm kơ đon sư hơwơ̆l hơwang hli tơrơ."
"And Saul’s servants said to him, “Surely, a distressing spirit from God is troubling you.","Lu đĭch đam sư roi: Đei minh 'nu yang kơnê̆ mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei wơh truh pơm kơ đon pơtao hơwơ̆l hơwang."
"Let our master now command your servants, who are before you, to seek out a man who is a skillful player on the harp. And it shall be that he will play it with his hand when the distressing spirit from God is upon you, and you shall be well.”","Apinh pơtao wơh lu nhôn chă kơ ih minh 'nu gơh reh tĭng-nĭng, tơdah layơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei wơh yang kơnê̆ truh tơ ih, na bơngai ei gô reh brŏ, na ih gô oei hiôk hơđơ̆ng."
"So Saul said to his servants, “Provide me now a man who can play well, and bring him to me.”","Sôl tơl hăm lu đĭch đam sư: Năm bĕ chă kơ inh minh 'nu bơngai reh brŏ hơgei, đơ̆ng noh chông ba sư năm tơ inh âu."
"Then one of the servants answered and said, “Look, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skillful in playing, a mighty man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a handsome person; and the LORD is with him.”","Minh 'nu lăm lu đĭch đam sư khan: Inh 'bôh minh 'nu kon drŏ-nglo Jese, bơngai Betlehem; sư reh brŏ hơgei dêh, sư minh 'nu bơngai tơblah nuih, pơma dơnuh hơgei păng muh măt sư hơbŏ 'lơ̆ng. Kră Yang oei hơdai sư."
"Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, “Send me your son David, who is with the sheep.”","Sôl wơh bơngai năm tơ Jese, na khan: Ăn bĕ kơ inh Đawit, kon drŏ-nglo ih, bơngai mă wei triu."
"And Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a skin of wine, and a young goat, and sent them by his son David to Saul.","Jese rôp minh pơm aseh iĕ iŏk 'bĕng sik minh kơdŭng akar, minh pơm kon bơbe oei mŏm, hơtŏk kơpal kơdŭ aseh iĕ athei kơ Đawit kon drŏ-nglo sư, chĕp ba ăn kơ Sôl."
"So David came to Saul and stood before him. And he loved him greatly, and he became his armorbearer.","Đawit truh tơ Sôl, păng jang hloi kơ sư. Sôl 'mêm kơ sư dêh mah iŏk ăn kơ sư chĕp tơmam blah."
"Then Saul sent to Jesse, saying, “Please let David stand before me, for he has found favor in my sight.”","Na Sôl wơh bơngai năm khan kơ Jese: Inh apinh ih ăn kơ Đawit oei tơ âu tơgŭm inh; yua kơ sư pơm kơ jơhngơ̆m inh hiôk."
"And so it was, whenever the spirit from God was upon Saul, that David would take a harp and play it with his hand. Then Saul would become refreshed and well, and the distressing spirit would depart from him.","Na mưh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ăn yang kơnê̆ mơ̆t pơm kơ Sôl hli, na Đawit iŏk brŏ tĭng-nĭng reh, pơlung Sôl pran hiôk, na yang kơnê̆ noh lĕch đơ̆ng sư."
"Now the Philistines gathered their armies together to battle, and were gathered at Sochoh, which belongs to Judah; they encamped between Sochoh and Azekah, in Ephes Dammim.","Kon pơlei Philistin krao akŭm lu linh sư wă tơblah lu sư akŭm tơ Sôkô, lăm dêh Juđa păng kơđông sư tơ Êphes Đamim, sơlam Sôkô păng Asêka."
"And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and they encamped in the Valley of Elah, and drew up in battle array against the Philistines.","Sôl păng lu bơngai Isơrael kư̆m akŭm băl mơ̆n pơm kơđông lăm thŭng Êlah na dă lu linh sư wă tơblah hăm lu kon pơlei bơngai Philistin."
"The Philistines stood on a mountain on one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side, with a valley between them.","Kon pơlei Philistin dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t groi pah âu; gah lu bơngai Isơrael dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t groi pah to; pŭng-lŭng sơlam lu sư."
"And a champion went out from the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, from Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.","Đei minh 'nu bơngai tih kơjung lĕch đơ̆ng kơđông Philistin, anăn sư Gôliat, đơ̆ng pơlei Gat; sư kơjung pêng hlok minh hơđa."
"He had a bronze helmet on his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail, and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of bronze.","Sư yơ̆l môk kơlăm kong hu rang tơ kơ̆l sư, hrŭk ao hơkar ka kong rang, trăp dang tơdrâu-jĭt kĭ"
"And he had bronze armor on his legs and a bronze javelin between his shoulders.","jơ̆ng pơ̆n chuă hăm kong, sơngiĕng hlok đao hăm kong."
"Now the staff of his spear was like a weaver’s beam, and his iron spearhead weighed six hundred shekels; and a shield-bearer went before him.","Gôliat kư̆m đei tơju, pla dư tih tŏ khơng đe tanh brai, kơnhŏng tơju trăp loi kơ tơpơh kĭ."
"Then he stood and cried out to the armies of Israel, and said to them, “Why have you come out to line up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and you the servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me.","Gôliat, sư dơ̆ng krao ôr lu bơngai Isơrael khan: Yua kơ kiơ lu iĕm 'maih tơblah?

"If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will be your servants. But if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall be our servants and serve us.”","Tơdah tơblah hăm inh jei sư păng sư pơlôch inh, lu nhôn gô pơm đĭch đam lu iĕm; mă-lei tơdah inh pran hloh kơ sư na inh pơlôch sư, lu iĕm gô pơm đĭch đam lu nhôn păng awih awăn kơ lu nhôn."
"And the Philistine said, “I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.”","Bơngai Philistin pơma hơno dơ̆ng: Tơpă, lăm năr 'nâu inh pơma pơlong lăng lu linh bơngai Isơrael; tơlĕch minh 'nu bơngai wăi, na lu bơ̆n tơblah băl."
"When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.","Sôl păng lu bơngai Isơrael mơ̆ng dôm lu nơ̆r bơngai Philistin, pơma noh jơhngơ̆m lu sư hli tơrơ dêh."
"Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem Judah, whose name was Jesse, and who had eight sons. And the man was old, advanced in years, in the days of Saul.","Na, Đawit, kon drŏ-nglo Jese bơngai Êphrat, oei lăm pơlei Betlehem dêh Juđa; sư đei tơhngam 'nu kon drŏ-nglo, lăm chăl Sôl, Jese sư bơngai kră mă đe pơyom."
"The three oldest sons of Jesse had gone to follow Saul to the battle. The names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.","Pêng 'nu kon drŏ-nglo Jese kiơ̆ boih Sôl năm tơblah. Anăn pêng 'nu kon drŏ-nglo ei: Kon kơdră Êliap, kon mă 'bar Abinađap păng kon mă pêng Samma."
"David was the youngest. And the three oldest followed Saul.","Đawit kon hơdruch, pêng 'nu 'nhŏng sư kiơ̆ Sôl."
"But David occasionally went and returned from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Bethlehem.","Mă-lei Đawit kư̆m brŏk năm đơ̆ng anih Sôl, brŏk tơ pơlei Betlehem wei triu 'bă sư."
"And the Philistine drew near and presented himself forty days, morning and evening.","Gôliat bơngai Philistin năm lĕch pơgê kơsơ̆, pơjăm linh bơngai Isơrael thoi noh lăm puăn-jĭt năr."
"Then Jesse said to his son David, “Take now for your brothers an ephah of this dried grain and these ten loaves, and run to your brothers at the camp.","Na Isai khan kơ Đawit, kon drŏ-nglo sư: Dăm kon e iŏk minh kơthŭnga 'ba mi hơdrĕng păng mơjĭt tŏ 'bĕng âu, kơdâu năm ba truh tơ kơđông chĕp ba ăn kơ lu đe 'nhŏng e."
"And carry these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand, and see how your brothers fare, and bring back news of them.”","Dăm kon e chĕp mơjĭt tŏ 'bĕng đak toh âu ăn kơ lu bơngai pơgơ̆r wei-lăng rơbâu 'nu linh, năm lăng lu đe 'nhŏng e hăm oei liĕm akâu dah ưh păng e kư̆m brŏk chĕp ăn kơ 'bă minh tơdra yă kiơ gah lu sư."
"Now Saul and they and all the men of Israel were in the Valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.","Lu 'nhŏng oei hơdai hăm Sôl păng đĭ-đăng lu linh bơngai Isơrael tơ lăm pŭng-lŭng Êlah, wă tơblah hăm lu linh kon pơlei Philistin."
"So David rose early in the morning, left the sheep with a keeper, and took the things and went as Jesse had commanded him. And he came to the camp as the army was going out to the fight and shouting for the battle.","Pơgê dơning đơ̆ng hrôih, Đawit lê̆ triu sư ăn kơ minh 'nu bơngai wei, iŏk tơmam na yak năm, thoi 'bă sư pơkă boih. Lăp sư truh tơ anih na kơplah noh hloi lu linh lĕch năm tơblah păng jreo re drŭt tơblah."
"For Israel and the Philistines had drawn up in battle array, army against army.","Bơngai Isơrael păng lu kon pơlei Philistin sư dă wă tơblah, 'bar pah linh tơklă băl muh măt."
"And David left his supplies in the hand of the supply keeper, ran to the army, and came and greeted his brothers.","Đawit ming lê̆ tơmam sa sư pơjao kơ minh 'nu bơngai wei tơmam, kơdâu truh tơ anih wă tơblah. Truh jet gia pêng 'nu lu đe 'nhŏng sư hăm oei liĕm kâu dah ưh."
"Then as he talked with them, there was the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, coming up from the armies of the Philistines; and he spoke according to the same words. So David heard them.","Kơplah sư oei pơma dơnuh hăm 'nhŏng sư, Gôliat, sư bơngai Philistin oei tơ pơlei Gat, đơ̆ng khŭl linh Philistin sư lĕch năm pơma pơjăm pơjuă thoi ki, na Đawit kơtơ̆ng đĭ sư pơma."
"And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him and were dreadfully afraid.","Đĭ-đăng lu linh bơngai Isơrael 'bôh Gôliat hli tơrơ, chă kơdâu ôn."
"So the men of Israel said, “Have you seen this man who has come up? Surely he has come up to defy Israel; and it shall be that the man who kills him the king will enrich with great riches, will give him his daughter, and give his father’s house exemption from taxes in Israel.”","Lu Sư khan tơduă: Lu iĕm hăm 'bôh bơngai noh to sư lĕch năm?

"Then David spoke to the men who stood by him, saying, “What shall be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?”","Đawit jet lu bơngai ngôi jê̆ sư: Đe gô apah kiơ kơ bơngai gơh pơlôch bơngai Philistin 'nâu păng wă kơ huay pă pơjăm lu bơngai Isơrael dơ̆ng?

"And the people answered him in this manner, saying, “So shall it be done for the man who kills him.”","Linh roi kơ Đawit tơmam apah noh: Bu gơh kĕ pơlôch sư na gô apah tơmam trŏ thoi đei roi boih."
"Now Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab’s anger was aroused against David, and he said, “Why did you come down here? And with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride and the insolence of your heart, for you have come down to see the battle.”","Mă-lei Êliap 'nhŏng kơdră sư, hil kơ Đawit pơma apinh thoi noh, na khan: E năm chă kiơ tơ âu?

"And David said, “What have I done now? Is there not a cause?”","Đawit tơl: Inh đei pơm kiơ? 'Noh inh wă apinh lăng đĕch!"
"Then he turned from him toward another and said the same thing; and these people answered him as the first ones did.","Sư weh ataih đơ̆ng 'nhŏng sư, apinh dơ̆ng lu bơngai nai minh nơ̆r thoi 'noh hei, na đe tơl kư̆m thoi adrol hei."
"Now when the words which David spoke were heard, they reported them to Saul; and he sent for him.","Đei bơngai kơtơ̆ng nơ̆r Đawit pơma, na plơ̆ roi ăn kơ Sôl băt; Sôl krao sư."
"Then David said to Saul, “Let no man’s heart fail because of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.”","Đawit khan kơ Sôl: Apinh 'nĕ ăn bơngai bu mă hli kơ bơngai Philistin noh! Inh đĭch đam pơtao gô năm tơblah hăm sư."
"And Saul said to David, “You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.”","Sôl găn Đawit: Ih ưh kơ kĕ wă tơblah hăm bơngai Philistin, yua kơ ih minh 'nu bơngai oei 'lơ̆p, sư 'noh bơngai juăt kơ tơblah đơ̆ng oei 'lơ̆p sơ̆."
"But David said to Saul, “Your servant used to keep his father’s sheep, and when a lion or a bear came and took a lamb out of the flock","Đawit tơl roi kơ Sôl: Kơplah inh wei triu 'bă inh, dah đei dăm-brang, chơgơu wă rôp sa triu đơ̆ng lăm khŭl triu"
"I went out after it and struck it, and delivered the lamb from its mouth; and when it arose against me, I caught it by its beard, and struck and killed it.","na inh druh, teh sư, pơdŭng iŏk triu đơ̆ng 'bơ̆r sư tơdah sư ôr bruh tơ inh, inh rôp sŏk kang sư, teh pơlôch sư."
"Your servant has killed both lion and bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, seeing he has defied the armies of the living God.”","Inh pơlôch boih dăm-brang păng chơgơu, thoi noh na bơngai Philistin to ưh kơ chu kăt tơdra akar tăm dơ̆ng inh kư̆m gô teh pơlôch sư thoi sem brem noh mơ̆n; yua kơ sư pơjăm lu linh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei mă arih ling-lang."
"Moreover David said, “The LORD, who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, He will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.” And Saul said to David, “Go, and the LORD be with you!”","Đawit khan dơ̆ng: Kră Yang pơklaih boih inh đơ̆ng dăm-brang păng đơ̆ng chơgơu, Sư kư̆m gô pơklaih inh mơ̆n đơ̆ng ti bơngai Philistin to noh, Sôl drơ̆ng: Năm bĕ, hơpơi Kră Yang oei hơdai hăm ih!"
"So Saul clothed David with his armor, and he put a bronze helmet on his head; he also clothed him with a coat of mail.","Sôl iŏk ao tơblah sư pơhrŭk ăn kơ Đawit, pơyơ̆l ăn môk kơlăm kong păng pơhrŭk ăn ao mam."
"David fastened his sword to his armor and tried to walk, for he had not tested them. And David said to Saul, “I cannot walk with these, for I have not tested them.” So David took them off.","Đawit tơ̆n đao Sôl tơ kơiĕng, 'nguaih, kơ ao tơblah na pơtơ̆p nơnăm, mă-lei ưh kơ gơh yua kơ ưh kơ juăt; sư khan kơ Sôl: Inh ưh kơ chĕp đao 'nâu yua kơ inh ưh kơ juăt yak ưh kơ gơh, Đawit plôh lê̆ ao ei."
"Then he took his staff in his hand; and he chose for himself five smooth stones from the brook, and put them in a shepherd’s bag, in a pouch which he had, and his sling was in his hand. And he drew near to the Philistine.","Đawit chĕp minh pơm 'long jra, chă dônh rơih iŏk pơđăm tŏ tơmo iêl hlăng tơter thong đak, tah lăm kơdŭng chơbĭ sư wei triu 'băk rim năr păng tơ'bla tơlei akar tơ ti sư, lĕch năm tơ anăp bơngai Philistin noh."
"So the Philistine came, and began drawing near to David, and the man who bore the shield went before him.","Bơngai Philistin noh kư̆m lĕch năm tơ jê̆ Đawit rai wă jê̆ đei bơngai chĕp đao nơnăm adrol."
"And when the Philistine looked about and saw David, he disdained him; for he was only a youth, ruddy and good-looking.","Bơngai Philistin noh lăng tơ Đawit, pơjăm hloi, 'bôh sư oei mơlôh akâu jăn muh măt sư 'lơ̆ng."
"So the Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?” And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.","Bơngai Philistin khan kơ Đawit: Inh ưh kơ sĭ kơ kŏ na ih chĕp 'long băl năm tơ inh? Bơngai Philistin yua anăn yang lu sư na hiap Đawit."
"And the Philistine said to David, “Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field!”","Bơngai Philistin hơnganh: Năm tơ âu wăi, inh gô ăn sĕch ih kơ lu sem păr păng lu sem bri sa."
"Then David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword, with a spear, and with a javelin. But I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.","Đawit khan kơ bơngai Philistin: Ih chĕp đao, năm blah inh, gah inh; inh yua anăn Kră Yang Tih Hloh, noh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu linh bơngai Isơrael, mă lu iĕm pơjăm pơjuă."
"This day the LORD will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you and take your head from you. And this day I will give the carcasses of the camp of the Philistines to the birds of the air and the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.","Năr 'nâu Kră Yang gô pơjao ih lăm tơpang ti inh, inh gô pơlôch ih, kăt kơ̆l ih păng bơngai Philistin lôch ăn kơ sem păr păng lu sem bri sa sĕch lu linh bơngai Philistin. Jơ̆p-jang kơ teh đak gô băt kơ bơngai Isơrael đei Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei"
"Then all this assembly shall know that the LORD does not save with sword and spear; for the battle is the LORD’s, and He will give you into our hands.”","Đĭ lu bơngai tơ âu gô 'bôh Kră Yang ưh kơ dŏng pơklaih păng đao dah păng tơju yua kơ Kră Yang jơ̆ yŏng kơ tơblah păng Sư gô jao lu iĕm lăm tơpang ti lu nhôn."
"So it was, when the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David, that David hurried and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.","Kơplah bơngai Philistin iung, năm sơng jê̆ Đawit, Đawit hăt hot kơdâu năm tơ anăp wă tơblah hăm bơngai Philistin."
"Then David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone; and he slung it and struck the Philistine in his forehead, so that the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the earth.","Đawit 'bot ti lăm kơdŭng sư, iŏk minh găr tơmo tah tơ lăm tơlei akar tơ'bla sư tăr wăr tơmo, 'bơm 'bơ̆t klĕng bơngai Philistin, tơmo mơ̆t đom lăm klĕng, Gôliat pơ̆k kơmŭ brum muh măt tơ teh."
"So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone, and struck the Philistine and killed him. But there was no sword in the hand of David.","Lei na Đawit blah Gôliat bơngai Philistin jei sư, hăm hră tơ'bla, hăm minh găr tơmo. Sư pơlôch Gôliat bơngai Philistin ưh kơ đei hăm đao lăm ti sư."
"Therefore David ran and stood over the Philistine, took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him, and cut off his head with it. And when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.","Na Đawit kơdâu juă kơpal akâu bơngai Philistin iŏk đao sư toh đơ̆ng hơnglop, 'bet pơlôch sư, păng kăt kơ̆l sư hloi. Kon pơlei Philistin 'bôh bơngai pran tih kơjung sư lôch bơih, na kơdâu."
"Now the men of Israel and Judah arose and shouted, and pursued the Philistines as far as the entrance of the valley and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell along the road to Shaaraim, even as far as Gath and Ekron.","Lu linh bơngai Isơrael păng bơngai Juđa iung jreo, tơkĕch, druh kon pơlei Philistin truh tơ trong mơ̆t pơlei Gat păng tơ 'măng jang pơlei Ekrôn. Lu bơngai Philistin jĭ rơka pơ̆k lôch 'bĕnh kơ trong đơ̆ng Saraim truh tơ pơlei Gat păng Êkrôn."
"Then the children of Israel returned from chasing the Philistines, and they plundered their tents.","Kon pơlei Isơrael đang đơ̆ng druh puh kon pơlei Philistin boih, na hơlơ̆k brŏk blah iŏk pơrăm kơđông sư."
"And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his armor in his tent.","Đawit dônh iŏk kơ̆l bơngai Philistin chĕp ba truh tơ Jêrusalem; mă-lei gah ao mam, môk kơlăm đao tơju Gôliat lê̆ lăm bơsŭn sư."
"When Saul saw David going out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, “Abner, whose son is this youth?” And Abner said, “As your soul lives, O king, I do not know.”","Sôl 'bôh Đawit năm blah bơngai Philistin, na jet Apne yŏng pơgơ̆r linh: Ơ Apner, bơngai tơdăm mơlôh noh kon drŏ-nglo bu? Apner tơl khan: Ơ pơtao inh arih sot! Inh ưh kơ băt."
"So the king said, “Inquire whose son this young man is.”","Pơtao khan kơ sư: Apinh lăng drŏ-nglo tơdăm mơlôh noh kon bu."
"Then, as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.","Wă, Đawit pơlôch bơih lu bơngai Philistin wơ̆t brŏk, Apner sơng sư, chông ba sư năm 'bơ̆t anăp Sôl, Đawit oei chĕp kơ̆l bơngai Philistin tơ ti sư."
"And Saul said to him, “Whose son are you, young man?” So David answered, “I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.”","Sôl pơma dơnuh hăm Đawit: Ơ dăm mơlôh, ih kon bu? Đawit tơl: Inh kon Jese, đĭch đam pơtao, oei tơ pơlei Betlehem."
"Now when he had finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.","Đawit pơma dơnuh hăm Sôl đang boih, Jônathan păng Đawit pơm buăl juăt yua, kơ Jônathan 'mêm kơ Đawit dêh thoi akâu sư kơdih."
"Saul took him that day, and would not let him go home to his father’s house anymore.","Năr noh, Sôl iŏk Đawit oei hloi tơ noh, ưh kơ ăn sư brŏk tơ hnam 'bă sư dơ̆ng."
"Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.","Jônathan pơgơ̆p hăm Đawit, yua kơ sư 'mêm kơ Đawit nhen thoi akâu sư kơdih."
"And Jonathan took off the robe that was on him and gave it to David, with his armor, even to his sword and his bow and his belt.","Jônathan plôh ao tai sư pơhrŭk ăn kơ Đawit, hăm ao tơblah sư hai, ăn đao, hră păng tơlei tơ̆n sư."
"So David went out wherever Saul sent him, and behaved wisely. And Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul’s servants.","Đawit lơ 'măng năm blah, mă tơ anih ayơ ayơ Sôl wơh sư năm, tơblah jei sư ngăl. Sôl pơjao ăn kơ sư pơgơ̆r linh, kon pơlei păng lu đĭch đam Sôl lăp đon kơ Đawit pơgơ̆r lu sư."
"Now it had happened as they were coming home, when David was returning from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women had come out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with tambourines, with joy, and with musical instruments.","Đang kơ Đawit pơlôch bơngai Philistin, wih brŏk hăm lu linh sư, na lu bơngai drŏ-kăn rim kơ pơlei bơngai Isơrael lĕch năm sơng Sôl, hơri suang, teh hơgơ̆r iĕ hăm brŏ tĭng-nĭng păng jreo nơ̆r hiôk chơt."
"So the women sang as they danced, and said: “Saul has slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands.”","Lu bơngai drŏ-kăn suang hơri pơdrơ̆ng băl khan: Sôl pơlôch rơbâu, rơbâu 'nu gah Đawit pơlôch mơjĭt-rơbâu rơbâu 'nu"
"Then Saul was very angry, and the saying displeased him; and he said, “They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed only thousands. Now what more can he have but the kingdom?”","Sôl blĕk dêh kơ dôm lu nơ̆r hơri 'nâu ưh kơ lăp jơhngơ̆m sư, sư khan: Đe khan Đawit pơlôch mơjĭt-rơbâu rơbâu 'nu, mă-lei gah inh khan rơbâu rơbâu 'nu đĕch; oei pă minh tam mă gơh pơm pơtao đĕch!"
"So Saul eyed David from that day forward.","Iŏk đơ̆ng năr noh, Sôl klai kơ Đawit dêh"
"And it happened on the next day that the distressing spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied inside the house. So David played music with his hand, as at other times; but there was a spear in Saul’s hand.","Năr đơ̆ng rŏng, Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ăn Yang kơnê̆ mơ̆t lăm Sôl; sư hli tơrơ pơma kư̆ kă lăm hnam sư, thoi bơngai wơnh, na Đawit reh brŏ thoi krô hmă. Sôl chĕp minh hlak tơju tơ ti sư."
"And Saul cast the spear, for he said, “I will pin David to the wall!” But David escaped his presence twice.","Sôl hrang Đawit, na khan: Inh gô pơ̆ng ih tơ tơnăr. Mă-lei Đawit pĕch kơ tơju 'bar wơ̆t."
"Now Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, but had departed from Saul.","Sôl hli kơ Đawit, yua kơ Kră Yang oei hơdai hăm Đawit, na achăng lê̆ sư."
"Therefore Saul removed him from his presence, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.","Sôl wă puh tơweh Đawit ataih kơ sư, jao ăn kơ Đawit wei pơgơ̆r minh-rơbâu 'nu linh tơblah. Đawit ngăl chông linh năm tơblah."
"And David behaved wisely in all his ways, and the LORD was with him.","Đawit năm tơblah mă tơ yơ yơ kư̆m jei sư ngăl yua kơ Kră Yang oei hơdai hăm sư."
"Therefore, when Saul saw that he behaved very wisely, he was afraid of him.","Sôl 'bôh Đawit năm tơblah jei sư ngăl, na Sôl rai hli dêh."
"But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.","Mă-lei đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael păng bơngai Juđa 'mêm kơ Đawit, yua kơ sư pơgơ̆r lu sư tơblah."
"Then Saul said to David, “Here is my older daughter Merab; I will give her to you as a wife. Only be valiant for me, and fight the LORD’s battles.” For Saul thought, “Let my hand not be against him, but let the hand of the Philistines be against him.”","Sôl pơma dơnuh hăm Đawit: 'Nâu Mêrap kon drŏ-kăn kơdră inh. Inh gô ăn kơ ih oei pơm akăn mă-lei ih athei mă nuih tơblah ăn kơ Kră Yang.

"So David said to Saul, “Who am I, and what is my life or my father’s family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?”","Đawit tơl khan: Ơ pơtao Inh âu bu? Adrĕch adrung inh bu, krung kơtum 'bă inh noh kiơ lăm bơngai Isơrael kiơ na pơk inh pơm ŏng pơtao?"
"But it happened at the time when Merab, Saul’s daughter, should have been given to David, that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite as a wife.","Na, truh tơ khei 'năr Mêrap, kon drŏ-kăn Sôl, wă ăn kơ Đawit oei, na pơtao tă ăn kơ Adriel oei bơngai đơ̆ng pơlei Mêhôta."
"Now Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved David. And they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.","Mă-lei Mikai, kon drŏ-kăn Sôl, hưch kơ Đawit. Sôl băt tơdrong noh, na jơhngơ̆m sư lăp đon."
"So Saul said, “I will give her to him, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.” Therefore Saul said to David a second time, “You shall be my son-in-law today.”","Sư tơchĕng khan: Inh gô ăn sư oei kơ Đawit, pơm thoi hơđong wă kơ Đawit 'leh lăm ti bơngai Philistin. Thoi noh Sôl pơma dơnuh 'măng mă 'bar hăm Đawit: Ih gô pơm ŏng inh."
"And Saul commanded his servants, “Communicate with David secretly, and say, ‘Look, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you. Now therefore, become the king’s son-in-law.’ ”","Na Sôl athei lu đĭch đam sư: Iĕm năm pơma hơdar hăm Đawit: Ih hăm 'bôh pơtao lăp đon kơ ih păng đĭ-đăng lu đĭch đam pơtao kư̆m 'mêm kơ ih mơ̆n; thoi noh na pơm bĕ ŏng pơtao."
"So Saul’s servants spoke those words in the hearing of David. And David said, “Does it seem to you a light thing to be a king’s son-in-law, seeing I am a poor and lightly esteemed man?”","Lu đĭch đam Sôl roi dơ̆ng dôm lu nơ̆r ei hăm Đawit. Đawit tơl khan: Pơm ŏng pơtao, iĕm tơchĕng tơdrong iĕ đĕch ah? Inh minh 'nu bơngai dơnuh hin păng răm-'băm."
"And the servants of Saul told him, saying, “In this manner David spoke.”","Lu đĭch đam Sôl roi ăn dơ̆ng kơ pơtao dôm nơ̆r Đawit tơl."
"Then Saul said, “Thus you shall say to David: ‘The king does not desire any dowry but one hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to take vengeance on the king’s enemies.’ ” But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.","Sôl khan kơ lu sư: Lu iĕm năm roi kơ Đawit; Pơtao ưh kơ đei apinh minh tơdrong kiơ ôh, kăl kơ minh-hrĕng tŏ kơ̆l tơmam drŏ-nglo bơngai Philistin, wă kơ pơm 'mong tơwih kơ lu bơngai ayăt kơ sư. Na Sôl chă đon wă pơm ăn kơ Đawit puh hiong lăm tơpang ti kon pơlei Philistin."
"So when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to become the king’s son-in-law. Now the days had not expired","Wă Lu đĭch đam roi ăn dơ̆ng dôm lu nơ̆r 'nâu kơ Đawit mơ̆ng, na Đawit chu kiơ̆ adrol kơ tơm năr pơkă wă pơm ŏng pơtao, adrol kơ năr pơkă."
"therefore David arose and went, he and his men, and killed two hundred men of the Philistines. And David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full count to the king, that he might become the king’s son-in-law. Then Saul gave him Michal his daughter as a wife.","Đawit năm hăm lu linh sư năm blah pơlôch 'bar-hrĕng 'nu lu bơngai Philistin.

"Thus Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved him","Wă Sôl lăng băt Kră Yang oei hơdai hăm Đawit, Mikal kon drŏ-kăn Sôl hưch 'mêm kơ Đawit"
"and Saul was still more afraid of David. So Saul became David’s enemy continually.","Sôl rai hli kơ Đawit dơ̆ng păng đĭ chăl arih pơtao ayăt hăm Đawit."
"Then the princes of the Philistines went out to war. And so it was, whenever they went out, that David behaved more wisely than all the servants of Saul, so that his name became highly esteemed.","Rim wơ̆t lu kră pơgơ̆r kon pơlei Philistin ngăl năm tơblah, hăm bơngai Isơrael na Đawit tơblah hloh kơ đĭ-đăng lu đĭch đam Sôl; thoi noh, anăn sư đe ư-ang rai dêh."
"Now Saul spoke to Jonathan his son and to all his servants, that they should kill David; but Jonathan, Saul’s son, delighted greatly in David.","Sôl pơđâu chă đon hăm Jônathan, kon drŏ-nglo sư păng lu đĭch đam sư wă pơlôch Đawit mă-lei Jônathan, kon drŏ-nglo Sôl, 'mêm dêh kơ Đawit."
"So Jonathan told David, saying, “My father Saul seeks to kill you. Therefore please be on your guard until morning, and stay in a secret place and hide.","Jônathan roi ăn kơ Đawit băt Sôl, 'bă inh, chă wă pơlôch ih. Thoi noh, pơgê dơning ih lĕch kơdâu tơ anih mă hlơp na ôn tơ noh."
"And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will speak with my father about you. Then what I observe, I will tell you.”","Inh gô năm dơ̆ng răp lăng 'bă inh 'bơ̆t anih chŭn mă ih ôn noh păng roi kơ 'bă inh gah ih gô lăng sư pơma thoi yơ, đơ̆ng noh inh roi ăn kơ ih băt."
"Thus Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father, and said to him, “Let not the king sin against his servant, against David, because he has not sinned against you, and because his works have been very good toward you.","Thoi noh, Jônathan pơma dŏng Đawit khan kơ 'bă sư: Apinh ih 'nĕ pơm tơdrong yoch hăm Đawit, đĭch đam ih, yua kơ sư ưh kơ đei pơm tơdrong yoch kiơ hăm ih, mă đei tơgŭm tơdrong jang tih ăn kơ ih dơ̆ng."
"For he took his life in his hands and killed the Philistine, and the LORD brought about a great deliverance for all Israel. You saw it and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood, to kill David without a cause?”","Sư hŭt akâu kơdih na mă pơlôch bơngai Philistin, yua kơ sư na Kră Yang đei ăn kơ bơngai Isơrael tơblah jei ngăl.

"So Saul heeded the voice of Jonathan, and Saul swore, “As the LORD lives, he shall not be killed.”","Sôl mơ̆ng nơ̆r Jônathan roi na sư pơkă khan: Inh pao anăn Kră Yang mă arih ling-lang, Đawit gô ưh kơ lôch ôh!"
"Then Jonathan called David, and Jonathan told him all these things. So Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as in times past.","Na, Jônathan krao Đawit, roi ăn dôm lu nơ̆r ei kơ sư, na chông ba Đawit năm tơ Sôl, na Đawit oei bơ̆jang kơ Sôl thoi adrol ki dơ̆ng."
"And there was war again; and David went out and fought with the Philistines, and struck them with a mighty blow, and they fled from him.","Đei tơdrong tơblah dơ̆ng, Đawit năm blah kon pơlei Philistin, pơm blah ăn kơ lu bơngai Philistin thuơ tih tơpă, lu sư kơdâu đi"
"Now the distressing spirit from the LORD came upon Saul as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand. And David was playing music with his hand.","Kră Yang ăn yang kơnê̆ mơ̆t lăm Sôl kơplah sư oei ngôi lăm hnam chĕp tơju tơ ti sư; 'bơ̆t Đawit oei reh brŏ tĭng-nĭng."
"Then Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he slipped away from Saul’s presence; and he drove the spear into the wall. So David fled and escaped that night.","Sôl iŏk tơju wă hrăng kơtĭt Đawit tơ tơnăr, mă-lei Đawit pĕch, tơju Sôl 'bơm tơ tơnăr. Đawit kơdâu hloi măng noh."
"Saul also sent messengers to David’s house to watch him and to kill him in the morning. And Michal, David’s wife, told him, saying, “If you do not save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be killed.”","Sôl wơh bơngai năm răp tơ hnam Đawit wă kơ pơgê đơ̆ng rŏng noh gơh pơlôch sư hloi, mă-lei Mikal akăn Đawit roi ăn kơ sư băt: Tơdah măng 'nâu ih ưh kơ kơdâu klĕnh, na pơgê dơning đe gô pơlôch ih."
"So Michal let David down through a window. And he went and fled and escaped.","Mikal tơjur Đawit trong 'măng-'mŏk; sư kơdâu klĕnh păng hlôi hloi"
"And Michal took an image and laid it in the bed, put a cover of goats’ hair for his head, and covered it with clothes.","Na, Mikal iŏk rup man tơ'bĭch kơpal giơng, iŏk 'long kơn sŏk bơbe hơgơn kơ̆l, tơsu ao kơ akâu rup."
"So when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, “He is sick.”","Na Sôl wơh bơngai năm rôp Đawit, na Mikal khan: Klo inh bơlŏ."
"Then Saul sent the messengers back to see David, saying, “Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may kill him.”","Sôl wơh dơ̆ng bơngai năm ngôi tơ Đawit, na khan kơ lu sư: Athei hiŏng sư hăm giơng noh ba tơ inh tơ âu: Lê̆ inh pơlôch sư."
"And when the messengers had come in, there was the image in the bed, with a cover of goats’ hair for his head.","Lu bơngai sư wơh năm tơ noh 'bôh rup man tơ'bĭch kơpal giơng, đei 'long kơn păng sŏk bơbe dan ala kơ̆l rup man noh."
"Then Saul said to Michal, “Why have you deceived me like this, and sent my enemy away, so that he has escaped?” And Michal answered Saul, “He said to me, ‘Let me go! Why should I kill you?’ ”","Sôl pơma hil kơ Mikal: Liơ e gơh hơlĕnh kơ inh thoi noh, lê̆ bơngai ayăt kơ inh kơdâu klĕnh? Mikal tơl 'bă sư: Na sư khan kơ inh: Ăn kơ inh lĕch, dah ưh, inh gô pơlôch e."
"So David fled and escaped, and went to Samuel at Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and stayed in Naioth.","Kơplah noh, Đawit kơdâu klĕnh sư năm tơ Samuel tơ Rama, roi ăn kơ Samuel dôm tơdrong mă Sôl pơm kơ sư. Na Đawit hăm Samuel năm, oei tơ Naiôt."
"Now it was told Saul, saying, “Take note, David is at Naioth in Ramah!”","Đei bơngai roi ăn kơ Sôl băt kơ. Đawit oei tơ Naiôt lăm pơlei Rama."
"Then Saul sent messengers to take David. And when they saw the group of prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as leader over them, the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.","Sôl wơh bơngai năm rôp Đawit; na lu sư 'bôh minh khŭl bơngai khan lê̆ adrol oei suang pơma khan lê̆ adrol păng Samuel pơgơ̆r lu bơngai ei, Yang Bơhngol 'Lơ̆ng Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei mơ̆t pơm kơ lu sư lu sư kư̆m suang pơma khan lê̆ adrol mơ̆n."
"And when Saul was told, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. Then Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also.","Lăp Sôl băt, na sư wơh lu bơngai nai plơ̆ng dơ̆ng; lu sư kư̆m suang pơma khan lê̆ adrol lei lai thoi lu bơngai noh hei. Sôl wơh dơ̆ng lu bơngai năm khŭl mă pêng, lu sư kư̆m suang pơma khan lê̆ adrol."
"Then he also went to Ramah, and came to the great well that is at Sechu. So he asked, and said, “Where are Samuel and David?” And someone said, “Indeed they are at Naioth in Ramah.”","Na Sôl năm akâu sư kơdih truh tơ pơlei Rama; truh tơ anih sơlŭng mong đak Sêku, na sư jet: Samuel păng Đawit oei tơ yơ? Đe tơl khan: Măr sư oei tơ Naiôt lăm pơlei Rama."
"So he went there to Naioth in Ramah. Then the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on and prophesied until he came to Naioth in Ramah.","Sư năm hloi tơ Naiôt lăm pơlei Rama; Yang Bơhngol Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei kư̆m mơ̆t tơ sư, sư kư̆m suang pơma khan lê̆ adrol dĭng truh tơ Naiôt lăm pơlei Rama"
"And he also stripped off his clothes and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”","Sư kư̆m plôh lê̆ ao sư kơdih, suang pơplŏng pơma khan lê̆ adrol 'bơ̆t anăp Samuel, na pơtao suang pơ̆k 'bĭch hloi tơ teh akâu hoh prăt măng lăm măng noh. Kơlih kơ thoi noh na, đei nơ̆r khan: Sôl kư̆m wang mơ̆t hơdai lu bơngai khan lê̆ adrol mơ̆n hă?"
"Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and went and said to Jonathan, “What have I done? What is my iniquity, and what is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?”","Đawit klĕnh đơ̆ng Naiôt lăm pơlei Rama, năm tơ Jônathan, na apinh Jônathan: Inh đei pơm yoch kiơ, tơdrong kơnê̆ kiơ? Inh pơm tơdrong yoch kiơ hăm 'bă ih, na mă sư chă đon wă pơlôch inh?"
"So Jonathan said to him, “By no means! You shall not die! Indeed, my father will do nothing either great or small without first telling me. And why should my father hide this thing from me? It is not so!”","Jônathan tơl sư: Ưh, ih huay kơ lôch ôh. 'Bă inh ưh kơ đei pơm kiơ, mă tơdrong tih dah tơdrong iĕ, khan ưh kơ roi kơ inh. Na 'bă inh wă ôn kơ inh tơdrong 'nâu ah? Ưh kơ đei ôh."
"Then David took an oath again, and said, “Your father certainly knows that I have found favor in your eyes, and he has said, ‘Do not let Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved.’ But truly, as the LORD lives and as your soul lives, there is but a step between me and death.”","Mă-lei Đawit khan hơđăl: 'Bă ih băt hơđăl ih 'mêm kơ inh, na đei pơma khan: 'Nĕ kơ roi ăn kơ Jônathan băt, kơnh sư hơ'ngon inh pao anăn Kră Yang mă arih ling-lang păng tơdrong arih ih na pơkă: Lăp minh yak đĕch sơlam inh hăm tơdrong lôch."
"So Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you yourself desire, I will do it for you.”","Jônathan tơl Đawit: Tơdah ih wă kơ inh pơm kiơ, inh gô pơm ăn kơ ih."
"And David said to Jonathan, “Indeed tomorrow is the New Moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king to eat. But let me go, that I may hide in the field until the third day at evening.","Đawit khan: Dơning năr mă mônh, lăm khei plơ̆ng inh juăt et sa hơdai hăm pơtao, mă-lei lê̆ inh năm ôn lăm tơmăn glă truh tơ kơsơ̆ năr mă pêng."
"If your father misses me at all, then say, ‘David earnestly asked permission of me that he might run over to Bethlehem, his city, for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.’","Tơdah 'bă ih 'bôh inh krŭl, na athei roi ăn kơ sư: Đawit apinh ih athei song sư brŏk tơ pơlei Betlehem, pơlei sư kơdih, yua kơ tơ noh đĭ hnam sư juăt kơ pơyơ̆r tơmam soi rim sơnăm."
"If he says thus: ‘It is well,’ your servant will be safe. But if he is very angry, be sure that evil is determined by him.","Tơdah sư tơl: 'Lơ̆ng, lei inh âu đĭch đam ih gô gơh hiôk, mă-lei tơdah sư hil blĕk, 'noh ih băt kơ sư wă pơlôch inh."
"Therefore you shall deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the LORD with you. Nevertheless, if there is iniquity in me, kill me yourself, for why should you bring me to your father?”","Apinh ih răk nơ̆r ih pơkă hăm inh đĭch đam ih, yua kơ ih đei pơkă anăn Kră Yang mă pơgơ̆p hăm đĭch đam ih. Dah inh đei yoch kiơ, apinh ih jah pơlôch inh bĕ; ngĕ kơ kiơ ba inh tơ 'bă ih?"
"But Jonathan said, “Far be it from you! For if I knew certainly that evil was determined by my father to come upon you, then would I not tell you?”","Jônathan tơl: 'Nĕ kơ tơchĕng kư̆ kă thoi noh! Tơdah inh băt tơpă kơ 'bă inh chă đon wă pơlôch ih, lei inh kư̆m ưh kơ roi kơ ih hă?"
"Then David said to Jonathan, “Who will tell me, or what if your father answers you roughly?”","Đawit apinh: Tơdah 'bă ih hil blĕk tơl ih, lei bu roi kơ inh băt?"
"And Jonathan said to David, “Come, let us go out into the field.” So both of them went out into the field.","Jônathan tơl: Bĕ, ba năm tơ tơmăn glă. Bre sư lĕch năm tơ tơmăn glă."
"Then Jonathan said to David: “The LORD God of Israel is witness! When I have sounded out my father sometime tomorrow, or the third day, and indeed there is good toward David, and I do not send to you and tell you","Jônathan khan: Đei Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu bơngai Isơrael pơm kơdranh!

"may the LORD do so and much more to Jonathan. But if it pleases my father to do you evil, then I will report it to you and send you away, that you may go in safety. And the LORD be with you as He has been with my father.","Tơdah 'bă inh khŏm pơm wă pơrăm ih, inh gô roi ăn kơ ih băt, athei ih năm mă hiôk-hian, dah ưh, apinh Kră Yang phak inh mă trăp! Hơpơi apinh Kră Yang oei hơdai ih, kư̆m thoi Sư oei hơdai boih hăm 'bă inh."
"And you shall not only show me the kindness of the LORD while I still live, that I may not die","Kơplah noh dah inh oei arih hăm apinh ih pơm 'lơ̆ng 'mêm mơnat dơ̆ng kơ inh. Wă kơ Inh lôch huay kơ"
"but you shall not cut off your kindness from my house forever, no, not when the LORD has cut off every one of the enemies of David from the face of the earth.”","Apinh ih oei wei tơdrong 'mêm ih hăm lu kon sâu nhôn ling-lang mă khan Kră Yang pơlôch pơđĭ lu bơngai ayăt kơ ih lăm kơpal teh âu."
"So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, “Let the LORD require it at the hand of David’s enemies.”","Na, Jônathan pơgơ̆p hăm Đawit păng hnam dơnŏ sư. Apinh Kră Yang phak lu bơngai ayăt kơ Đawit. Dah lu sư ưh kơ 'blŏk kơ tơdrong pơgơ̆p ba."
"Now Jonathan again caused David to vow, because he loved him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul.","Jônathan 'mêm kơ Đawit thoi 'mêm kơ akâu sư kơdih, na athei Đawit pơkă. Kŭm 'mêm kơ sư."
"Then Jonathan said to David, “Tomorrow is the New Moon; and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty.","Jônathan khan dơ̆ng: Dơning năr mă mônh khei plơ̆ng đe ei 'bôh ih krŭl yua kơ 'bơ̆t anih ih ưh kơ đei bơngai oei."
"And when you have stayed three days, go down quickly and come to the place where you hid on the day of the deed; and remain by the stone Ezel.","Năr mă pêng wă khan năr dơmônh inh gô truh tơ anih ih ôn adrol ki, na gô lăng 'bơ̆t cheng tơmo Êse!"
"Then I will shoot three arrows to the side, as though I shot at a target","Inh gô prah pêng găr 'brơ̆m hră tơklă tơmo tih noh. Thoi đe prah pơđam."
"and there I will send a lad, saying, ‘Go, find the arrows.’ If I expressly say to the lad, ‘Look, the arrows are on this side of you; get them and come’—then, as the LORD lives, there is safety for you and no harm.","Đơ̆ng noh, inh gô wơh đĭch đam inh na khan kơ sư: Năm dônh lu 'brơ̆m hră to, tơdah inh khan kơ sư: To 'brơ̆m hră pah âu e, iŏk wăi, noh wă khan hiôk hiang na ih athei lĕch: Kră Yang arih ling-lang gô pơm kơdranh.

"But if I say thus to the young man, ‘Look, the arrows are beyond you’—go your way, for the LORD has sent you away.","Mă-lei tơdah inh khan kơ đĭch đam inh: To, 'brơ̆m hră pah to ataih 'biơ̆, kơplah noh ih athei ôn yua kơ Kră Yang wă kơ ih năm."
"And as for the matter which you and I have spoken of, indeed the LORD be between you and me forever.”","Gah nơ̆r ba hlôi pơkă pơkăm boih, hơpơi kơ Kră Yang pơm kơdranh tŏk-bŏk ih hăm inh truh ning-mônh ling-lang."
"Then David hid in the field. And when the New Moon had come, the king sat down to eat the feast.","Thoi noh, Đawit ôn lăm tơmăn glă truh tơ giĕng năr mônh, khei plơ̆ng, pơtao hơ-oei wă sŏng sa"
"Now the king sat on his seat, as at other times, on a seat by the wall. And Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul’s side, but David’s place was empty.","Pơtao hơ-oei 'bơ̆t anih juăt kơ hơ-oei jê̆ tơnăr Jônathan muh măt tơklă 'bă sư, na Apner hơ-oei cheng Sôl; 'bơ̆t anih Đawit ưh kơ đei bu hoh-hoy."
"Nevertheless Saul did not say anything that day, for he thought, “Something has happened to him; he is unclean, surely he is unclean.”","Năr noh, Sôl ưh kơ đei pơma kiơ, tơchĕng khan băt đei tơdrong kiơ truh kơ Đawit boih 'nâu! Hơbŏ sư ưh kơ rơgoh, đei tơdrong 'mê̆-'mach boih 'nâu."
"And it happened the next day, the second day of the month, that David’s place was empty. And Saul said to Jonathan his son, “Why has the son of Jesse not come to eat, either yesterday or today?”","Mă-lei năr đơ̆ng rŏng, năr 'bar anih Đawit kư̆m ưh kơ đei bu dơ̆ng. Sôl khan kơ Jônathan kon drŏ-nglo sư: Yua kơ kiơ kon drŏ-nglo Jese ưh kơ năm sŏng sa hơdai năr brei păng năr 'nâu hloi?"
"So Jonathan answered Saul, “David earnestly asked permission of me to go to Bethlehem.","Jônathan tơl Sôl khan: Đawit apinh inh asong ăn kơ sư brŏk tơ pơlei Betlehem."
"And he said, ‘Please let me go, for our family has a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has commanded me to be there. And now, if I have found favor in your eyes, please let me get away and see my brothers.’ Therefore he has not come to the king’s table.”","Lê̆ inh năm; yua kơ hnam nhôn đei tơdrong pơyơ̆r tơmam soi lăm pơlei, na 'nhŏng inh pơkă kơ inh athei năm tơ noh.

"Then Saul’s anger was aroused against Jonathan, and he said to him, “You son of a perverse, rebellious woman! Do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness?","Na, Sôl khan kơ Jônathan: Ơ kon drŏ-nglo hơlĕnh păng ayăt plơ̆ plĕch kơ inh, inh băt kơ e pơm buăl juăt hăm kon drŏ-nglo Jese, wă pơm ăn kơ e mơlâu đĕch păng pơm ăn kơ mĕ e kư̆m mơlâu mơ̆n!"
"For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, you shall not be established, nor your kingdom. Now therefore, send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die.”","Dah kon drŏ-nglo Jese arih sot lăm kơpal teh âu dĭng truh dang yơ, na e păng teh đak e kư̆m ưh kơ đei dang noh mơ̆n; dang ei hloi, chông ba sư tơ inh âu; sư trŏ kơ lôch."
"And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, “Why should he be killed? What has he done?”","Jônathan tơl, 'bă sư: Liơ wă pơlôch sư? Sư pơm glăi kiơ?"
"Then Saul cast a spear at him to kill him, by which Jonathan knew that it was determined by his father to kill David.","Sôl hrang dao wă pơlôch; Jônathan băt tơpă kơ 'bă sư wă pơlôch Đawit."
"So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day of the month, for he was grieved for David, because his father had treated him shamefully.","Jônathan iung weh tơ nai, blĕk dêh na lăm năr 'bar khei plơ̆ng noh na ưh kơ đei sa kiơ, hơ'ngon ưh kơ hiôk kơ Đawit, yua kơ 'bă sư pơjăm Đawit."
"And so it was, in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad was with him.","Pơgê đơ̆ng rŏng, Jônathan lĕch năm tơ tơmăn glă tơ anih pơkă hăm Đawit; đei minh 'nu đĭch tơdăm kiơ̆ sư."
"Then he said to his lad, “Now run, find the arrows which I shoot.” As the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.","Sư athei bơngai noh: E năm dônh lu 'brơ̆m hră mă đêl inh prah, bơngai đĭch noh kơdâu. Jônathan prah minh găr 'brơ̆m hră hlôi kơ sư."
"When the lad had come to the place where the arrow was which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried out after the lad and said, “Is not the arrow beyond you?”","Na bơngai đĭch noh năm truh tơ anih 'brơ̆m hră đêl Jônathan prah, na Jônathan krao khan: 'Brơ̆m hră pah to kơ e ataih 'biơ̆."
"And Jonathan cried out after the lad, “Make haste, hurry, do not delay!” So Jonathan’s lad gathered up the arrows and came back to his master.","Jônathan krao dơ̆ng bơngai đĭch noh: Năm mă tĕnh, 'nĕ kơ pơhiơ̆! Bơngai đĭch noh dônh 'brơ̆m hră, wơ̆t hơlơ̆k tơ tơ'ngla sư dơ̆ng."
"But the lad did not know anything. Only Jonathan and David knew of the matter.","Na đĭch sư ưh kơ băt kơ kiơ ôh, mă-lei Đawit hăm Jônathan đei băt."
"Then Jonathan gave his weapons to his lad, and said to him, “Go, carry them to the city.”","Jônathan ăn kơ đĭch sư hră păng khan: Năm bĕ, chĕp ba brŏk tơ pơlei."
"As soon as the lad had gone, David arose from a place toward the south, fell on his face to the ground, and bowed down three times. And they kissed one another; and they wept together, but David more so.","Hlôi kơ đĭch sư năm boih, Đawit iung đơ̆ng gah gơal kơ tơmo sơtơ̆p kŭl-tăng tơ teh păng kơkuh kơ Jônathan pêng wơ̆t, na bre sư tơkuăr chŭm păng nhơ̆m, Đawit nhơ̆m đunh hloh."
"Then Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace, since we have both sworn in the name of the LORD, saying, ‘May the LORD be between you and me, and between your descendants and my descendants, forever.’ ” So he arose and departed, and Jonathan went into the city.","Jônathan pơma dơnuh hăm Đawit: Yak năm bĕ kơ ih mă 'lơ̆ng; lu bơ̆n yua anăn Kră Yang pơgơ̆p nơ̆r pơkă băl; Kră Yang gô pơm kơdranh sơlam tŏk-bŏk inh hăm ih tŏk-bŏk adrĕch adrung inh păng adrĕch adrung ih dĭng truh ning-mônh ling-lang."
"","Thoi noh, Đawit iung yak năm, gah Jônathan brŏk mơ̆t lăm pơlei."
"Now David came to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest. And Ahimelech was afraid when he met David, and said to him, “Why are you alone, and no one is with you?”","Đawit truh tơ pơlei Nŏp, tơ'bơ̆p 'bok soi tơm Ahimelek. Ahimelek hli tơtơ̆, kơdâu sơng iŏk sư, na jet: Liơ minh drô̆ ih đĕch ưh kơ đei bu kiơ̆ ih?"
"So David said to Ahimelech the priest, “The king has ordered me on some business, and said to me, ‘Do not let anyone know anything about the business on which I send you, or what I have commanded you.’ And I have directed my young men to such and such a place.","Đawit tơl hăm 'bok soi tơm Ahimelek: Pơtao đei wơh inh minh tơdrong jang păng pơkă khan: 'Nĕ kơ roi ăn kơ bu băt gah tơdrong jang inh wơh ih pơm, kư̆m 'nĕ kơ ăn bu băt nơ̆r inh athei ih. Inh hlôi pơkă ăn boih kơ lu đĭch đam inh 'bơ̆t anih tơ'bơ̆p băl."
"Now therefore, what have you on hand? Give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatever can be found.”","Dang ei 'bok soi hăm đei tơmam sa ưh? Asong inh bĕ pơđăm tŏ 'bĕng mi dah tơmam kiơ 'bok soi đei kư̆m bưh."
"And the priest answered David and said, “There is no common bread on hand; but there is holy bread, if the young men have at least kept themselves from women.”","'Bok soi tơm tơl Đawit: Lăm tơpang ti inh ưh kơ đei 'bĕng hmă, mă-lei đei 'bĕng rơgoh đĕch; kư̆ mă lu đĭch đam ih ưh kơ đei jê̆ drŏ-kăn."
"Then David answered the priest, and said to him, “Truly, women have been kept from us about three days since I came out. And the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in effect common, even though it was consecrated in the vessel this day.”","Đawit tơl hăm 'bok soi: Kơplah nhôn lĕch năm tơblah, lu nhôn ưh kơ đei jê̆ minh 'nu drŏ-kăn ayơ ôh.

"So the priest gave him holy bread; for there was no bread there but the showbread which had been taken from before the LORD, in order to put hot bread in its place on the day when it was taken away.","Thoi noh, 'bok soi tơm ăn kơ Đawit 'bĕng 'lơ̆ng rơgoh yua kơ tơ noh ưh kơ đei 'bĕng nai 'nguaih kơ 'bĕng rơgoh 'lơ̆ng mă đe 'măn lê̆ 'bơ̆t gơ'bang anăp Kră Yang, wă tơplih kơ 'bĕng 'nao plơ̆ng lăm minh năr tơplih."
"Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD. And his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chief of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul.","Lăm năr noh, đei minh 'nu đĭch đam Sôl oei tơ noh mơ̆n, đe gơ̆t lê̆ sư lăm hnam akŭm 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, anăn sư Đôe bơngai Eđôm, pơgơ̆r lu bơngai wei triu Sôl."
"And David said to Ahimelech, “Is there not here on hand a spear or a sword? For I have brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s business required haste.”","Đawit jet Ahimelek: 'Bok soi, ih hăm đei tơju đah dao ayơ? Inh ưh kơ đei chĕp ba dao dah tơju tơmam kiơ ôh, yua kơ pơtao wơh inh hăt hot dêh."
"So the priest said, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, there it is, wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you will take that, take it. For there is no other except that one here.” And David said, “There is none like it; give it to me.”","'Bok soi tơm tơl: Âu 'nâu đei đao Gôliat bơngai Philistin mă đêl ih pơlôch lăm thŭng Êlah oei pôn lê̆ lăm che, lê̆ 'bơ̆t cheng êphot to; tơdah ih wă iŏk, na iŏk wăi; tơ âu ưh kơ đei dao nai. Đawit tơl: Ưh kơ đei dao nai dang đao 'nâu, pơjao ăn kơ inh."
"Then David arose and fled that day from before Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.","Đawit iung năr noh sư oei ôn kơ Sôl năm truh tơ Akis, pơtao Gat."
"And the servants of Achish said to him, “Is this not David the king of the land? Did they not sing of him to one another in dances, saying: ‘Saul has slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands’?”","Lu đĭch đam Akis jet: 'Nâu hăm trŏ kơ Đawit, pơtao dêh noh dah kiơ?

"Now David took these words to heart, and was very much afraid of Achish the king of Gath.","Đawit tơtăm kơ nơ̆r 'nâu lăm jơhngơ̆m hli dêh kơ Akis, pơtao Gat."
"So he changed his behavior before them, pretended madness in their hands, scratched on the doors of the gate, and let his saliva fall down on his beard.","Đawit pơm wơnh 'bơ̆t anăp lu đe noh păng thoi bơngai sem brem, Đawit chhơ̆ tơ lu 'măng păng lê̆ đak hai ro tơ sŏk kang sư."
"Then Achish said to his servants, “Look, you see the man is insane. Why have you brought him to me?","Akis khan kơ lu đĭch đam sư: To lu iĕm hăm 'bôh bơngai noh wơnh, yua kơ kiơ lu iĕm chông ba sư truh tơ inh?"
"Have I need of madmen, that you have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? Shall this fellow come into my house?”","Tơ anih inh âu ưh kơ đei bơngai wơnh hă, na lu iĕm chông ba bơngai 'nâu truh tơ inh wă kơ sư pơyeh inh hă? Na liơ bơngai thoi âu mă mơ̆t lăm hnam inh?"
"David therefore departed from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam. So when his brothers and all his father’s house heard it, they went down there to him.","Đawit weh đơ̆ng noh, năm ôn lăm hơgơp tơmo tơ pơlei Ađulam lu đe 'nhŏng sư păng đĭ-đăng kơ hnam dơnŏ 'bă sư băt, na jur năm tơ sư"
"And everyone who was in distress, everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was discontented gathered to him. So he became captain over them. And there were about four hundred men with him.","Kŭm đei lu bơngai pơmat-tat, lu bơngai hre đom păng lu bơngai đei jơhngơ̆m ơh sơ'ngon kư̆m wang jur akŭm hơdai hăm sư, na sư pơm kơ̆l lu đe ei; thoi noh lu sư đei dang puăn-hrĕng 'nu bơngai."
"Then David went from there to Mizpah of Moab; and he said to the king of Moab, “Please let my father and mother come here with you, till I know what God will do for me.”","Đơ̆ng noh Đawit năm tơ pơlei Mispa lăm dêh Môap, na sư pơma dơnuh hăm pơtao Môap: Apinh ih asong ăn kơ lu mĕ 'bă inh năm oei hơdai hăm ih dĭng truh tơ inh băt dôm tơdrong kiơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei gô pơm ăn kơ inh."
"So he brought them before the king of Moab, and they dwelt with him all the time that David was in the stronghold.","Thoi noh Đawit chông ba mĕ 'bă sư năm truh 'bơ̆t anăp pơtao Môap, na măr sư oei hơdai hăm pơtao đĭ kơ măng năr Đawit ôn tơ noh."
"Now the prophet Gad said to David, “Do not stay in the stronghold; depart, and go to the land of Judah.” So David departed and went into the forest of Hereth.","Mă-lei, Gat bơngai khan lê̆ adrol, khan kơ Đawit: Ih 'nĕ pă ôn tơ hơgơp tơmo âu; năm bĕ tơ dêh Juđa; Đawit năm truh tơ bri Hêrêt."
"When Saul heard that David and the men who were with him had been discovered—now Saul was staying in Gibeah under a tamarisk tree in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants standing about him","Sôl băt kơ lu bơngai chă 'bôh tơ'bơ̆p Đawit hăm lu bơngai kiơ̆ sư. Kơplah noh Sôl oei ngôi ala yơ̆p 'long hla prai tơ Gibêah, ti sư chĕp tơju, gah lu đĭch đam sư oei tăp dăr kơ sư."
"then Saul said to his servants who stood about him, “Hear now, you Benjamites! Will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds?","Sôl pơma kơ lu đĭch đam sư mă oei tăp dăr kơ sư: Ơ lu adrĕch bơngai Bênjamin mơ̆ng bĕ.

"All of you have conspired against me, and there is no one who reveals to me that my son has made a covenant with the son of Jesse; and there is not one of you who is sorry for me or reveals to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as it is this day.”","Liơ đĭ-đăng kơ lu iĕm pơm đon ayăt kơ inh?

"Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who was set over the servants of Saul, and said, “I saw the son of Jesse going to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.","Đôe bơngai Eđôm, wei pơgơ̆r lu đĭch đam Sôl tơl thoi âu: Inh 'bôh kon drŏ-nglo Jese năm tơ pơlei Nŏp, mơ̆t lăm hnam Ahimelek, kon drŏ-nglo Ahitup"
"And he inquired of the LORD for him, gave him provisions, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.”","Ahimelek krao apinh Kră Yang tơgŭm păng đei ăn tơmam sa kơ sư, kư̆m ăn kơ sư tơju Gôliat, bơngai Philistin."
"So the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s house, the priests who were in Nob. And they all came to the king.","Pơtao wơh bơngai năm krao Ahimelek, kon drŏ-nglo Ahitup, jơ̆ 'bok soi tơm hăm đĭ-đăng hnam dơnŏ 'bă sư, pơm 'bok soi mă oei lăm pơlei Nŏp; đĭ-đăng kơ lu sư năm tơ pơtao."
"And Saul said, “Hear now, son of Ahitub!” He answered, “Here I am, my lord.”","Sôl khan: Ơ kon drŏ-nglo Ahitup, mơ̆ng bĕ. Sư tơl: Ô, đei inh âu."
"Then Saul said to him, “Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread and a sword, and have inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as it is this day?”","Sôl khan dơ̆ng: Yua kơ kiơ ih pơm đon hăm kon drŏ-nglo Jese mă ayăt hăm inh?

"So Ahimelech answered the king and said, “And who among all your servants is as faithful as David, who is the king’s son-in-law, who goes at your bidding, and is honorable in your house?","Ahimelek tơl pơtao: Na, lăm lu đĭch đam ih, bơngai bu tơnăp dang Đawit.

"Did I then begin to inquire of God for him? Far be it from me! Let not the king impute anything to his servant, or to any in the house of my father. For your servant knew nothing of all this, little or much.”","Hăm trŏ kơ 'nao năr 'nâu đĕch inh krao khan, apinh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ăn kơ sư? Tơpă inh ưh kơ đei pơm thoi noh!

"And the king said, “You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you and all your father’s house!”","Pơtao tơl: Ahimelek, tơpă ih păng lu hnam dơnŏ ih gô lôch!"
"Then the king said to the guards who stood about him, “Turn and kill the priests of the LORD, because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled and did not tell it to me.” But the servants of the king would not lift their hands to strike the priests of the LORD.","Pơtao khan kơ lu bơngai pơm đam kơ'yĕng sư dơ̆ng jê̆ sư thoi âu: Năm pơlôch bĕ, lu 'bok soi đơ̆ng Kră Yang yua kơ lu sư tơgŭm Đawit, băt kơ sư ôn mă ưh kơ roi kơ inh băt; mă-lei lu đĭch đam pơtao ưh kơ pơ̆n wă pơlôch lu 'bok soi đơ̆ng Kră Yang."
"And the king said to Doeg, “You turn and kill the priests!” So Doeg the Edomite turned and struck the priests, and killed on that day eighty-five men who wore a linen ephod.","Pơtao, khan kơ Đôe: Ih năm pơlôch lu 'bok soi bĕ.

"Also Nob, the city of the priests, he struck with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and nursing infants, oxen and donkeys and sheep—with the edge of the sword.","Sôl pơlôch kon pơlei Nop păng đao, pơlei lu 'bok soi, bơngai drŏ-nglo păng bơngai drŏ-kăn, lu hơ'lơ̆p păng lu bơngai oei mŏm, rơmo, aseh iĕ păng triu, pơlôch đĭ-đăng păng đao."
"Now one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled after David.","Mă-lei, minh 'nu lăm kon drŏ-nglo Ahimelek, sâu Ahitup anăn sư Abiathar lĕch hlôi klaih na kơdâu truh tơ'bơ̆p Đawit."
"And Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the LORD’s priests.","Abiathar roi ăn kơ Đawit băt: Sôl hlôi pơlôch boih lu 'bok soi đơ̆ng Kră Yang."
"So David said to Abiathar, “I knew that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I have caused the death of all the persons of your father’s house.","Đawit tơl Abiathar: Lăm năr noh, inh băt hơđăl kơ Đôe, bơngai Eđôm, sư kư̆m đei măt tơ noh mơ̆n, rŏ lăng sư roi ăn kơ Sôl.

"Stay with me; do not fear. For he who seeks my life seeks your life, but with me you shall be safe.”","Oei hơdai inh, 'nĕ kơ hli; bơngai bu chă pơrăm tơdrong arih inh, kư̆m chă pơrăm tơdrong arih ih mơ̆n; ih oei hơdai inh ih gơh đei hiôk hơđơ̆ng."
"Then they told David, saying, “Look, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah, and they are robbing the threshing floors.”","Đei bơngai năm roi kơ Đawit: To, lu bơngai Philistin năm blah pơlei Kêila păng tơgar iŏk 'ba đơ̆ng lu cham preh 'ba"
"Therefore David inquired of the LORD, saying, “Shall I go and attack these Philistines?” And the LORD said to David, “Go and attack the Philistines, and save Keilah.”","Đawit krao apinh Kră Yang: Inh hăm gơh blah lu bơngai Philistin 'nâu?

"But David’s men said to him, “Look, we are afraid here in Judah. How much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?”","Lu bơngai kiơ̆ Đawit khan: Tơ lăm dêh Juđa, lu bơ̆n oei hli dêh, pơma kơ kiơ năm truh tơ pơlei Kêila blah lu linh Philistin!"
"Then David inquired of the LORD once again. And the LORD answered him and said, “Arise, go down to Keilah. For I will deliver the Philistines into your hand.”","Đawit krao apinh dơ̆ng Kră Yang; Kră Yang tơl sư: Iung bĕ, jur năm tơ Kêila; Inh gô jao kon pơlei bơngai Philistin lăm tơpang ti ih."
"And David and his men went to Keilah and fought with the Philistines, struck them with a mighty blow, and took away their livestock. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.","Đawit jur năm hăm bơngai kiơ̆ sư truh tơ pơlei Kêila, tơblah hăm kon pơlei bơngai Philistin, pơm ăn kơ lu sư kĕ jei tih, 'noh boih, Đawit dŏng pơklaih kon pơlei Kêila thoi noh."
"Now it happened, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah, that he went down with an ephod in his hand.","Na, kơplah Abiathar, kon drŏ-nglo Ahimelek, kơdâu klĕnh tơ Đawit tơ pơlei Kêila, đei chĕp ba êphot."
"And Saul was told that David had gone to Keilah. So Saul said, “God has delivered him into my hand, for he has shut himself in by entering a town that has gates and bars.”","Đe kư̆m roi ăn kơ Sôl băt Đawit mơ̆t lăm Kêila; Sôl khan: Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei jao sư lăm tơpang ti inh, yua kơ sư năm ba akâu sư lăm pơlei đei 'măng jang tang chơkăl đĭ."
"Then Saul called all the people together for war, to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men.","Sôl krao đĭ lu linh năm jur tơ Kêila, wang tăp dăr kơ Đawit păng lu bơngai kiơ̆ sư."
"When David knew that Saul plotted evil against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring the ephod here.”","Wă Đawit băt Sôl chă wă pơrăm sư, na sư khan kơ 'bok soi tơm Abiathar: Chĕp ba ao êphot tơ âu."
"Then David said, “O LORD God of Israel, Your servant has certainly heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah to destroy the city for my sake.","Đawit, krao khan: Kơkuh kơ Ih Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei bơngai Isơrael, đĭch đam ih băt kơ Sôl wă năm blah pơrăm kon pơlei Kêila, yua kơ inh."
"Will the men of Keilah deliver me into his hand? Will Saul come down, as Your servant has heard? O LORD God of Israel, I pray, tell Your servant.” And the LORD said, “He will come down.”","Lu kon pơlei Kêila gô jao inh lăm tơpang ti Sôl hă? Sôl gô jur năm thoi nơ̆r đĭch đam Ih kơtơ̆ng boih?

"Then David said, “Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul?” And the LORD said, “They will deliver you.”","Đawit apinh dơ̆ng: Lu kon pơlei Kêila gô jao inh păng lu bơngai kiơ̆ inh lăm tơpang ti Sôl hă? Kră Yang tơl: Lu sư gô jao lu iĕm."
"So David and his men, about six hundred, arose and departed from Keilah and went wherever they could go. Then it was told Saul that David had escaped from Keilah; so he halted the expedition.","Đawit hăm lu bơngai kiơ̆ sư, dang tơdrâu-hrĕng 'nu bơngai lu sư iung lĕch đơ̆ng pơlei Kêila păng năm tơ anih ayơ mă gơh oei. Sôl băt kơ Đawit lĕch hlôi boih đơ̆ng Kêila, na ưh pă năm blah dơ̆ng."
"And David stayed in strongholds in the wilderness, and remained in the mountains in the Wilderness of Ziph. Saul sought him every day, but God did not deliver him into his hand.","Đawit oei lăm char glă chơngue, hơdrô̆ tơ kơpal groi char glă Sip. Sôl chă sư rim năr ưh kơ pơdơh, mă-lei Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ưh kơ đei layơ wă jao Đawit lăm tơpang ti Sôl."
"So David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life. And David was in the Wilderness of Ziph in a forest.","Kơplah Đawit oei tơ Hơres lăm char glă sip Đawit 'bôh Sôl ba linh wă pơrăm tơdrong arih sư."
"Then Jonathan, Saul’s son, arose and went to David in the woods and strengthened his hand in God.","Na Jônathan kon drŏ-nglo Sôl, iung năm tơ Hơres ngôi tơ Đawit oei lăm bri, pơma pơlung sư oei kơjăp đei đon lui gơnang kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei"
"And he said to him, “Do not fear, for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you. You shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next to you. Even my father Saul knows that.”","Jônathan khan kơ Đawit: Ih 'nĕ kơ hli; ti Sôl, 'bă inh, ưh kơ gơh hơtŭt 'bơm kơ ih ôh.

"So the two of them made a covenant before the LORD. And David stayed in the woods, and Jonathan went to his own house.","'Bar 'nu bre sư kư̆m pơgơ̆p pơkă 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang; na Đawit oei lăm Hơres dơ̆ng, gah Jônathan wih brŏk tơ hnam sư."
"Then the Ziphites came up to Saul at Gibeah, saying, “Is David not hiding with us in strongholds in the woods, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?","Kon pơlei Sip tŏk năm tơ Sôl tơ Gibêah, na roi: Đawit ôn tơ lăm lu nhôn tơ lăm bri, Hơres kơpal groi Hakila, oei tơ gah gơal Jêsimôn."
"Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of your soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king’s hand.”","Na, ơ pơtao dah ih wă jur, jur bĕ tơ tơring lu nhôn, lu nhôn gô rôp sư jao sư ăn kơ ih."
"And Saul said, “Blessed are you of the LORD, for you have compassion on me.","Sôl tơl: Hơpơi kơ Kră Yang ăn pŭn hiôk kơ lu iĕm, yua kơ lu iĕm đei jơhngơ̆m băt mơnat kơ inh!"
"Please go and find out for sure, and see the place where his hideout is, and who has seen him there. For I am told he is very crafty.","Năm apinh pơnhen lăng dơ̆ng wă kơ băt mă hơđăl anih ayơ sư oei păng bu hlôi 'bôh boih sư oei tơ noh; yua kơ đe đei roi khan sư bơngai hơgei hơlĕnh dêh."
"See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hides; and come back to me with certainty, and I will go with you. And it shall be, if he is in the land, that I will search for him throughout all the clans of Judah.”","Năm pơnhen lăng dơ̆ng păng wă kơ băt rim anih sư ôn, na wih brŏk roi ăn kơ inh mă hơđăl, na inh gô năm hơdai hăm lu iĕm. Tơdah sư oei oei lăm tơring, na inh gô chơchă sư tơ rim lăm adrĕch bơngai Juđa."
"So they arose and went to Ziph before Saul. But David and his men were in the Wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.","Na lu sư iung brŏk wih tơ char glă Sip adrol kơ Sôl; gah Đawit păng lu bơngai kiơ̆ sư oei lăm char glă chơngue Maôn tơ Araba gah gơal Jêsimôn."
"When Saul and his men went to seek him, they told David. Therefore he went down to the rock, and stayed in the Wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued David in the Wilderness of Maon.","Sôl hăm lu bơngai kiơ̆ sư năm chă Đawit. Đawit băt kơ tơdrong noh, na jur lăm bri kông, lăm char glă chơngue Maôn, Sôl băt na druh kiơ̆ Đawit lăm char glă chơngue Maôn."
"Then Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men on the other side of the mountain. So David made haste to get away from Saul, for Saul and his men were encircling David and his men to take them.","Sôl tŏk kông pah âu, Gah Đawit hăm khŭl kiơ̆ sư tŏk kông pah to.

"But a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Hurry and come, for the Philistines have invaded the land!”","Đei minh 'nu bơngai năm truh tơ Sôl na roi ăn: Jah brŏk tĕnh tĕnh bĕ, lu kon pơlei bơngai Philistin năm mơ̆t blah tơgar iŏk dêh bơ̆n boih."
"Therefore Saul returned from pursuing David, and went against the Philistines; so they called that place the Rock of Escape.","Na Sôl pă druh Đawit boih, năm brŏk blah kon pơlei bơngai Philistin, thoi ei na, đe khan anih 'nâu jơ̆ Tơmo Tih dŏng pơklaih."
"Then David went up from there and dwelt in strongholds at En Gedi.","Na, Đawit weh hlôi đơ̆ng anih năm oei tơ anih kơjăp tơ kông Êngêđi."
"Now it happened, when Saul had returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, “Take note! David is in the Wilderness of En Gedi.”","Kơplah Sôl druh blah lu bơngai Philistin wih brŏk đei minh 'nu bơngai năm roi kơ Sôl thoi âu: To, Đawit oei lăm char glă Êngêđi."
"Then Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel, and went to seek David and his men on the Rocks of the Wild Goats.","Sôl chĕp ba pêng-rơbâu 'nu linh hơgei rơih đơ̆ng lăm lu bơngai Isơrael, năm chă Đawit hăm lu bơngai kiơ̆ sư, năm truh tơ lu Tơmo Bơbe Bri."
"So he came to the sheepfolds by the road, where there was a cave; and Saul went in to attend to his needs. (David and his men were staying in the recesses of the cave.)","Sôl năm truh 'bơ̆t jê̆ anih hơdrong bơbe triu, tơ noh đei minh pơm hơgơp tơmo; Sôl mơ̆t lăm noh năm wă kơ chă bơyơ̆ng. Na, Đawit hăm lu bơngai kiơ̆ sư oei tơ lăm hơgơp jrŭ."
"Then the men of David said to him, “This is the day of which the LORD said to you, ‘Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, that you may do to him as it seems good to you.’ ” And David arose and secretly cut off a corner of Saul’s robe.","Lu bơngai kiơ̆ Đawit roi kơ sư: Năr 'nâu jơ̆ năr mă Kră Yang đei khan kơ ih: Inh gô jao lu bơngai ayăt kơ ih lăm tơpang ti ih mơ̆ng kơ ih wă pơm liơ kơ sư; đơ̆ng noh Đawit iung, năm kăt tơtông iŏk tơdrơi ao Sôl."
"Now it happened afterward that David’s heart troubled him because he had cut Saul’s robe.","'Blă kơ noh lăm jơhngơ̆m sư hmach kơdih yua kơ kăt iŏk tơdrơi ao pơtao."
"And he said to his men, “The LORD forbid that I should do this thing to my master, the LORD’s anointed, to stretch out my hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.”","Sư khan kơ lu bơngai kiơ̆ sư: Hơpơi kơ Kră Yang phak inh tơdah inh pơm yoch hăm yŏng tơ'ngla inh, bơngai mă chu tuh đak rơmă đơ̆ng Kră Yang, yua kơ sư jơ̆ bơngai chu tuh đak rơmă đơ̆ng Kră Yang."
"So David restrained his servants with these words, and did not allow them to rise against Saul. And Saul got up from the cave and went on his way.","Đawit khă lu bơngai kiơ̆ sư, 'nĕ kơ pơm kơ akâu Sôl, Sôl iung lĕch đơ̆ng hơgơp tơmo na yak rok trong năm tơ nai."
"David also arose afterward, went out of the cave, and called out to Saul, saying, “My lord the king!” And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed down.","Kơplah noh Đawit kư̆m iung, lĕch đơ̆ng lăm tơmo, krao Sôl, na khan: Ơ pơtao, yŏng inh! Sôl hue lăng tơ rŏng, na Đawit kŭp kơ̆l tơ teh."
"And David said to Saul: “Why do you listen to the words of men who say, ‘Indeed David seeks your harm’?","Đawit khan kơ Sôl: Yua kơ kiơ pơtao mơ̆ng dôm lu nơ̆r đe khan: Đawit chă wă pơrăm pơtao?"
"Look, this day your eyes have seen that the LORD delivered you today into my hand in the cave, and someone urged me to kill you. But my eye spared you, and I said, ‘I will not stretch out my hand against my lord, for he is the LORD’s anointed.’","To, lăng bĕ măt ih 'bôh năr 'nâu lăm hơgơp tơmo Kră Yang jao ih lăm tơpang ti inh, đei bơngai athei inh pơlôch ih, mă-lei inh mơnat kơ ih, na khan inh ưh kơ pơm kiơ kơ akâu jăn yŏng inh yua kơ sư jơ̆ đơ̆ng Kră Yang tuh ăn đak rơmă."
"Moreover, my father, see! Yes, see the corner of your robe in my hand! For in that I cut off the corner of your robe, and did not kill you, know and see that there is neither evil nor rebellion in my hand, and I have not sinned against you. Yet you hunt my life to take it.","Ơ 'bă! Lăng bĕ tơdrơi ao ih mă inh oei chĕp lăm tơpang ti inh; ih 'bôh inh lăp kăt iŏk tơdrơi ao ih mă-lei inh ưh kơ pơlôch ih, băt boih inh ưh kơ đei pơm tơdrong yoch kiơ hăm ih. Mă-lei gah ih, chă wă pơlôch inh."
"Let the LORD judge between you and me, and let the LORD avenge me on you. But my hand shall not be against you.","Apinh Kră Yang gô sek tơlang ih păng inh. Kră Yang gô pơm 'mong kơ ih ăn kơ inh, mă-lei gah inh ưh kơ đei pơm kiơ truh kơ akâu jăn ih."
"As the proverb of the ancients says, ‘Wickedness proceeds from the wicked.’ But my hand shall not be against you.","Đe đei nơ̆r khan: Tơdrong kơnê̆ lĕch đơ̆ng bơngai kơnê̆. Mă-lei tơpang ti inh ưh kơ đei layơ wă hơtŭt 'bơm akâu jăn ih."
"After whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom do you pursue? A dead dog? A flea?","Pơtao Isơrael tơblah hăm bu? Ih druh 'moi bu? Minh pơm kŏ lôch! Minh pơm siso!"
"Therefore let the LORD be judge, and judge between you and me, and see and plead my case, and deliver me out of your hand.”","Apinh, Kră Yang gô pơm kơdranh sek tơlang ih păng inh. Sư gô lăng lăng păng dŏng inh păng sek tơlang tơpăt na dŏng pơklaih inh đơ̆ng tơpang ti ih."
"So it was, when David had finished speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, “Is this your voice, my son David?” And Saul lifted up his voice and wept.","Đang kơ Đawit pơma dôm lu nơ̆r 'nâu boih, na Sôl tơl: Ơ Đawit kon inh, hăm trŏ kon dah kiơ? Sôl nhơ̆m ôr"
"Then he said to David: “You are more righteous than I; for you have rewarded me with good, whereas I have rewarded you with evil.","Sôl khan kơ Đawit: Kon pơm tơpăt hloh kơ 'bă, yua kơ iŏk tơdrong 'lơ̆ng, na pơm 'mong tơdrong kơnê̆ 'bă hlôi pơm ăn kơ kon."
"And you have shown this day how you have dealt well with me; for when the LORD delivered me into your hand, you did not kill me.","Năr 'nâu, kon tơ'bôh kon iŏk tơdrong 'lơ̆ng pơm hăm 'bă; yua kơ Kră Yang hlôi pơjao boih 'bă lăm tơpang ti kon, mă-lei kon ưh kơ đei pơlôch 'bă"
"For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him get away safely? Therefore may the LORD reward you with good for what you have done to me this day.","Hăm đei bu tơ'bơ̆p bơngai ayăt hăm bơ̆n mă khan achăng lê̆ sư brŏk hiôk-hian ưh kơ đei kiơ? Hơpơi kơ Kră Yang iŏk tơdrong 'lơ̆ng pơm ăn kơ kon gah tơdrong kon hlôi pơm ăn kơ 'bă năr 'nâu!"
"And now I know indeed that you shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand.","Tơpă inh băt kơ kon gô pơm pơtao păng teh đak Isơrael gô kơjăp sot lăm tơpang ti kon."
"Therefore swear now to me by the LORD that you will not cut off my descendants after me, and that you will not destroy my name from my father’s house.”","Thoi noh dang ei, yua bĕ anăn Kră Yang pơkă hăm inh khan kon ưh kơ gơh wă pơlôch adrĕch adrung inh păng kư̆m ưh kơ gơh wă pơrăm lê̆ anăn inh đơ̆ng lu yă 'bok inh."
"So David swore to Saul. And Saul went home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.","Đawit pơkă nơ̆r hăm Sôl. Sôl brŏk wih tơ hnam sư, gah Đawit hăm lu bơngai kiơ̆ sư hơlơ̆k tơ anih ôn kơ'nơp dơ̆ng."
"Then Samuel died; and the Israelites gathered together and lamented for him, and buried him at his home in Ramah. And David arose and went down to the Wilderness of Paran.","Samuel lôch; đĭ-đăng lu bơngai Isơrael akŭm băl nhơ̆m hmoi kơ sư, đơ̆ng noh 'bŭ sư tơ lăm pơlei Rama. Đawit iung jur năm tơ char glă Pharan."
"Now there was a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel, and the man was very rich. He had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats. And he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.","Na, đei minh 'nu bơngai oei tơ pơlei Maôn, mă-lei teh jang sa tơ pơlei Karmel, sư bơngai mơdrŏng, đei pêng-rơbâu triu păng minh-rơbâu bơbe; sư oei tơ Karmel oei yuă sŏk triu sư."
"The name of the man was Nabal, and the name of his wife Abigail. And she was a woman of good understanding and beautiful appearance; but the man was harsh and evil in his doings. He was of the house of Caleb.","Anăn sư Nabal păng akăn sư anăn Abigail; akăn sư hơgei 'lơ̆ng hơbŏ, gah klo sư bơngai khĕnh; kơnê̆ sư adrĕch Kalep."
"When David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep","Đawit oei lăm tơmăn glă khan Nabal yuă sŏk triu"
"David sent ten young men; and David said to the young men, “Go up to Carmel, go to Nabal, and greet him in my name.","Na wơh mơjĭt 'nu tơdăm mơlôh năm pơkă kơ lu sư: Năm bĕ tơ Karmel, tơ'bơ̆p Nabal roi pơtruh nơ̆r inh hơpong hăm sư."
"And thus you shall say to him who lives in prosperity: ‘Peace be to you, peace to your house, and peace to all that you have!","Lu iĕm khan: Hơpơi kơ ih đei arih sot chơt hiôk, hơpơi kơ hnam dơnŏ ih kư̆m chơt hiôk; tơm!"
"Now I have heard that you have shearers. Your shepherds were with us, and we did not hurt them, nor was there anything missing from them all the while they were in Carmel.","Đawit kơtơ̆ng ang khan ih đei lu bơngai hơgei yuă sŏk triu. Kơplah lu bơngai wei triu ih oei jê̆ lu nhôn kơplah lu nhôn ưh kơ đei pơm kiơ kơ lu sư kơplah tơ Karmel. Lu sư kư̆m ưh kơ đei kiơ hiong ôh."
"Ask your young men, and they will tell you. Therefore let my young men find favor in your eyes, for we come on a feast day. Please give whatever comes to your hand to your servants and to your son David.’ ”","Ih apinh bĕ lu đĭch đam ih, lu sư gô roi ăn kơ ih. Apinh ih ăn kơ lu tơdăm mơlôh inh đei mơnat 'bơ̆t anăp ih, yua kơ lu nhôn năm tơ âu trŏ kơ năr giĕng 'lơ̆ng rŏ. Đah lăm tơpang ti ih đei tơmam kiơ, asong bĕ kơ lu đĭch đam ih păng ăn kơ kon ih Đawit."
"So when David’s young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all these words in the name of David, and waited.","Lu tơdăm mơlôh đơ̆ng Đawit wơh năm truh păng pơtruh nơ̆r Đawit hơpong kơ Nabal. Pơma roi đang boih; lu sư gô."
"Then Nabal answered David’s servants, and said, “Who is David, and who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants nowadays who break away each one from his master.","Nabal tơl lu đĭch đam Đawit: Đawit noh bu? Kon drŏ-nglo Jese noh bu? Lu đĭch đam klĕnh đơ̆ng yŏng tơ'ngla lăm năr 'nâu lơ dêh!"
"Shall I then take my bread and my water and my meat that I have killed for my shearers, and give it to men when I do not know where they are from?”","Na inh iŏk 'bĕng, đak păng 'nhĕm inh hơmet boih kơ lu bơngai jang yuă sŏk bơbe triu na mă wă ăn kơ lu bơngai ưh kơ băt đơ̆ng yơ truh tơ âu?"
"So David’s young men turned on their heels and went back; and they came and told him all these words.","Lu tơdăm mơlôh đơ̆ng Đawit wơh wih brŏk dơ̆ng, lu sư roi ăn kơ Đawit mơ̆ng dôm lu nơ̆r noh."
"Then David said to his men, “Every man gird on his sword.” So every man girded on his sword, and David also girded on his sword. And about four hundred men went with David, and two hundred stayed with the supplies.","Đawit khan kơ lu bơngai kiơ̆ sư: Rim 'nu kơ lu bơ̆n athei tơ̆n đao bơ̆n. Lu sư tơ̆n đao păng Đawit kư̆m tơ̆n đao sư; dang puăn-hrĕng 'nu bơngai năm kiơ̆ Đawit, oei pă 'bar-hrĕng 'nu bơngai oei răp gô wei tơmam."
"Now one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, “Look, David sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master; and he reviled them.","Đei minh 'nu bơngai đĭch roi ăn kơ Abigail, Akăn Nabal: Đawit đei wơh lu bơngai đơ̆ng char glă năm tơ'bơ̆p yŏng tơ'ngla lu nhôn, mă-lei Nabal pơma re kơ lu sư."
"But the men were very good to us, and we were not hurt, nor did we miss anything as long as we accompanied them, when we were in the fields.","Kơplah mă lu nhôn oei jê̆ lu sư lăm tơmăn glă, lu sư pơm 'lơ̆ng hăm lu nhôn, lu nhôn huay kơ đei tơdrong kiơ păng kư̆m ưh kơ đei kơ'bah dah hiong minh tơmam kiơ ôh."
"They were a wall to us both by night and day, all the time we were with them keeping the sheep.","Lu sư bơwei lu nhôn mă kơ'năr păng kơmăng lu sư nhen thoi dur pĕng lu nhôn, kơplah lu nhôn wei triu jê̆ tơ lăm tơring lu sư."
"Now therefore, know and consider what you will do, for harm is determined against our master and against all his household. For he is such a scoundrel that one cannot speak to him.”","Thoi noh dang ei ih athei tơchĕng lăng wă pơm liơ yua kơ gô đei tơdrong răm truh kơ yŏng tơ'ngla lu nhôn păng kư̆m truh kơ hnam dơnŏ ih; yŏng tơ'ngla khĕnh dêh, ưh kơ đei bu pơ̆n pơma kiơ hăm sư."
"Then Abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five sheep already dressed, five seahs of roasted grain, one hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and loaded them on donkeys.","Abigail hăt hot iŏk 'bar-hrĕng tŏ tơpei 'bĕng, 'bar kơthŭng akar sik hơmu; 'nhĕm pơđăm tŏ triu pai sĭn boih.

"And she said to her servants, “Go on before me; see, I am coming after you.” But she did not tell her husband Nabal.","Na sư khan kơ lu đĭch đam sư: Bĕ năm adrol kơ inh, inh gô năm kiơ̆ đơ̆ng rŏng, mă-lei sư ưh kơ đei roi ăn kơ Nabal klo sư băt."
"So it was, as she rode on the donkey, that she went down under cover of the hill; and there were David and his men, coming down toward her, and she met them.","Sư hao aseh iĕ jur lăm thong đei kông tăp dăr na 'bôh Đawit hăm lu bơngai kiơ̆ sư kư̆m năm tơklă tơ lu sư."
"Now David had said, “Surely in vain I have protected all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that belongs to him. And he has repaid me evil for good.","Đawit đei pơma khan: Tơpă pih pang gleh lap đĕch lu nhôn hlôi bơwei dôm tơmam bơngai 'nâu lăm char glă, sư huay kơ'bah dah hiong minh tơdrong kiơ, mă-lei sư iŏk tơdrong kơnê̆ 'mong tơdrong 'lơ̆ng inh pơm."
"May God do so, and more also, to the enemies of David, if I leave one male of all who belong to him by morning light.”","Hơpơi kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei phak inh thoi âu dah mă trăp hloh! Tơdah truh tơ dơning inh oei lê̆ minh 'nu bơngai drŏ-nglo ayơ oei arih lăm hnam dơnŏ sư."
"Now when Abigail saw David, she dismounted quickly from the donkey, fell on her face before David, and bowed down to the ground.","Abigail 'bôh Đawit, jur hloi đơ̆ng aseh iĕ hăt hot, na drap tơ teh 'bơ̆t anăp Đawit."
"So she fell at his feet and said: “On me, my lord, on me let this iniquity be! And please let your maidservant speak in your ears, and hear the words of your maidservant.","Thoi noh sư kŭp kơ̆l 'bơ̆t jơ̆ng na pơma khan thoi âu: Ơ yŏng tơ'ngla, inh glăi, glăi inh! Apinh đĭch đam ih âu gơh pơma roi hăm ih; apinh mơ̆ng bĕ dôm lu nơ̆r đĭch đam ih âu."
"Please, let not my lord regard this scoundrel Nabal. For as his name is, so is he: Nabal is his name, and folly is with him! But I, your maidservant, did not see the young men of my lord whom you sent.","Apinh ih 'nĕ kơ jơ̆ yo kơ Nabal bơngai khĕnh to 'noh; yua kơ jơhngơ̆m klơm klak sư trŏ kơ anăn sư, anăn sư Nabal yua kơ lăm sư đei ưh kơwao, kơchu; gah inh, inh ưh kơ 'bôh lu bơngai mă ih wơh."
"Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD lives and as your soul lives, since the LORD has held you back from coming to bloodshed and from avenging yourself with your own hand, now then, let your enemies and those who seek harm for my lord be as Nabal.","Kră Yang găn ih wă pơm tuh pham wă pơm 'mong inh pao anăn Kră Yang mă arih ling-lang păng tơdrong arih ih kơdih na pơkă; hơpơi kơ lu ayăt kơ ih păng lu bơngai chă wă pơrăm ih kư̆m pŭ nhen thoi Nabal!"
"And now this present which your maidservant has brought to my lord, let it be given to the young men who follow my lord.","Na dang ei 'nâu jơ̆ tơmam đĭch đam ih chĕp ba wă ăn kơ ih, kư̆m wă asong ăn kơ lu bơngai kiơ̆ ih."
"Please forgive the trespass of your maidservant. For the LORD will certainly make for my lord an enduring house, because my lord fights the battles of the LORD, and evil is not found in you throughout your days.","Apinh 'nĕ jơ̆ yo kơ đĭch đam ih âu!

"Yet a man has risen to pursue you and seek your life, but the life of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living with the LORD your God; and the lives of your enemies He shall sling out, as from the pocket of a sling.","Tơdah đei bu wă iung pơm kơnê̆ păng pơrăm tơdrong arih ih Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ih gô bơwei tơdrong arih lăm hơnŭng lu bơngai arih; gah tơdrong arih lu bơngai ayăt kơ ih, Kră Yang gô klơ̆m tŭk lê̆ mă ataih thoi hră prah 'brơ̆m tơmo."
"And it shall come to pass, when the LORD has done for my lord according to all the good that He has spoken concerning you, and has appointed you ruler over Israel","Layơ mă Kră Yang pơm 'lơ̆ng mă sư hlôi pơkă wă ăn kơ ih, păng kư̆m pơk ih pơm yŏng pơgơ̆r lu bơngai Isơrael"
"that this will be no grief to you, nor offense of heart to my lord, either that you have shed blood without cause, or that my lord has avenged himself. But when the LORD has dealt well with my lord, then remember your maidservant.”","Hơpơi rŏ kơ ih huay kơ tơtăm dah jơhngơ̆m ưh kơ hiôk yua kơ đei tuh pham mă tơdrong ưh kơ đei pơm 'mong kơ kơdih akâu. Layơ Kră Yang ăn kơ ih đei pŭn hiôk, apinh 'blŏk kơ inh."
"Then David said to Abigail: “Blessed is the LORD God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me!","Đawit tơl nơ̆r Abigail: Inh kơkuh bơnê kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu bơngai Isơrael, đei wơh ih năm truh tơ'bơ̆p inh năr 'nâu!"
"And blessed is your advice and blessed are you, because you have kept me this day from coming to bloodshed and from avenging myself with my own hand.","Inh kơkuh bơnê kơ Kră Yang. Sư ăn pŭn hiôk hlôh wao gơh hơgei kơ ih năr 'nâu găn inh ưh kơ ăn inh pơm tuh pham păng găn inh, ưh kơ wă inh pơm 'mong ăn kơ inh kơdih."
"For indeed, as the LORD God of Israel lives, who has kept me back from hurting you, unless you had hurried and come to meet me, surely by morning light no males would have been left to Nabal!”","Tơpă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei mă arih ling-lang lu bơngai Isơrael, jơ̆ Kră Yang găn inh ưh ăn kơ inh pơrăm ih, tơdah ih ưh kơ hăt hot tơ'bơ̆p inh, na truh pơgê dơning ưh kơ đei minh 'nu bơngai drŏ-nglo ayơ mă oei arih lăm hnam Nabal."
"So David received from her hand what she had brought him, and said to her, “Go up in peace to your house. See, I have heeded your voice and respected your person.”","Đawit iŏk dôm tơmam đơ̆ng ti sư chĕp ba na pơkă khan: Brŏk wih bĕ tơ hnam dơnŏ ih hiôk hơđơ̆ng, inh kơtơ̆ng boih dôm nơ̆r ih apinh păng inh kư̆m răk kiơ̆ thoi nơ̆r hơpơi."
"Now Abigail went to Nabal, and there he was, holding a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. And Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk; therefore she told him nothing, little or much, until morning light.","Wă Abigail brŏk truh tơ Nabal, na 'bôh Nabal oei et sa tih lăm hnam sư, et sa tih nhen thoi pơtao mơ̆n.

"So it was, in the morning, when the wine had gone from Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became like a stone.","Pơgê năr đơ̆ng rŏng gô Nabal huay pă suai boih, akăn sư roi ăn kơ sư dôm tơdrong noh, na sư hli dêh akâu sư arănga nhen thoi tơmo."
"Then it happened, after about ten days, that the LORD struck Nabal, and he died.","Dang mơjĭt năr đơ̆ng rŏng Kră Yang pơlôch Nabal na sư lôch hloi."
"So when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Blessed be the LORD, who has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has kept His servant from evil! For the LORD has returned the wickedness of Nabal on his own head.” And David sent and proposed to Abigail, to take her as his wife.","Đawit kơtơ̆ng ang Nabal lôch boih, sư khan: Trŏ kơkuh bơnê ư-ang kơ Kră Yang.

"When the servants of David had come to Abigail at Carmel, they spoke to her saying, “David sent us to you, to ask you to become his wife.”","Lu đĭch đam Đawit năm chă Abigail, tơ Karmel, na khan: Đawit wơh lu nhôn năm truh tơ ih, năm iŏk ih sư wă iŏk ih pơm akăn."
"Then she arose, bowed her face to the earth, and said, “Here is your maidservant, a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.”","Abigail, drap kơkuh hloi, na khan: Inh âu wă pơm đĭch đam Đawit pơm bơngai ôp jơ̆ng yŏng tơ'ngla inh."
"So Abigail rose in haste and rode on a donkey, attended by five of her maidens; and she followed the messengers of David, and became his wife.","Abigail iung hloi, hao aseh iĕ sư, đei pơđăm 'nu đĭch drŏ-kăn sư năm kiơ̆ sư, na năm hơdai hăm lu bơngai Đawit wơh, pơm akăn Đawit."
"David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel, and so both of them were his wives.","Đawit adrol noh kư̆m iŏk oei kơ Ahinôam, oei tơ Jesreel na 'bar 'nu bre noh kư̆m pơm akăn sư."
"But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was from Gallim.","Mikal kon drŏ-kăn Sôl, đêl akăn Đawit Sôl ăn oei kơ Phaltiel kon Lais, bơngai đơ̆ng pơlei Galim."
"Now the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, “Is David not hiding in the hill of Hachilah, opposite Jeshimon?”","Kon pơlei Sip năm chă Sôl tơ Gibêah, na roi khan: Đawit oei ôn tơ kơpal groi Hakila, tơklă char Jêsimôn."
"Then Saul arose and went down to the Wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the Wilderness of Ziph.","Sôl iung năm chĕp ba pêng-rơbâu linh rơih iŏk đơ̆ng lăm lu bơngai Isơrael, năm jur tơ lăm char glă Sip chă Đawit."
"And Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which is opposite Jeshimon, by the road. But David stayed in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.","Sôl pơm kơđông kơpal groi Hakila 'bơ̆t cheng trong tơklă char glă Jêsimôn."
"David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul had indeed come.","Na wơh bơngai năm lăng tơng păng băt tơpă Sôl truh boih"
"So David arose and came to the place where Saul had encamped. And David saw the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army. Now Saul lay within the camp, with the people encamped all around him.","Đawit iung, năm truh 'bơ̆t anih Sôl pơm kơđông; sư 'bôh anih tep Sôl păng Apner kon drŏ-nglo Nêr, bơngai mă pơgơ̆r linh; Sôl tep lăm kơđông đei lu linh tep tăp dăr kơ sư."
"Then David answered, and said to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother of Joab, saying, “Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp?” And Abishai said, “I will go down with you.”","Đawit jet Ahimelek, bơngai Hêtit păng Abisai kon drŏ-nglo Sêruia, oh Jôap: Bu 'maih năm hăm inh jur năm tơ anih Sôl? Abisai tơl: Inh gô năm jur hăm ih."
"So David and Abishai came to the people by night; and there Saul lay sleeping within the camp, with his spear stuck in the ground by his head. And Abner and the people lay all around him.","Na Đawit păng Abisai oei măng năm mơ̆t lăm kơđông, 'bôh Sôl oei tep lăm kơđông, tơju hlôt tơ teh cheng kơ̆l sư. Apner hăm lu linh tep tăp dăr kơ sư."
"Then Abishai said to David, “God has delivered your enemy into your hand this day. Now therefore, please, let me strike him at once with the spear, right to the earth; and I will not have to strike him a second time!”","Abisai khan kơ Đawit: Năr 'nâu Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei pơjao bơngai ayăt kơ ih lăm tơpang ti ih. Ăn kơ inh iŏk tơju sư 'bet hơtơ̆p sư tơ teh; ưh kơ kăl kơ 'bet pơlơ̆k mă 'bar dơ̆ng."
"But David said to Abishai, “Do not destroy him; for who can stretch out his hand against the LORD’s anointed, and be guiltless?”","Mă-lei Đawit khan kơ Abisai: 'Nĕ kơ pơlôch sư, kơnh ih đei tơdrong glăi, yua kơ sư bơngai mă đơ̆ng Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei tuh ăn đak rơmă."
"David said furthermore, “As the LORD lives, the LORD shall strike him, or his day shall come to die, or he shall go out to battle and perish.","Sư khan dơ̆ng: Đei Kră Yang mă arih ling-lang, inh pơkă hăm ih, tơpă Kră Yang gô ăn kơ sư lôch, dah trŏ kơ măng năr sư gô lôch, dah sư lôch kơ tơblah"
"The LORD forbid that I should stretch out my hand against the LORD’s anointed. But please, take now the spear and the jug of water that are by his head, and let us go.”","Mă-lei Kră Yang wei inh, ưh kơ ăn tơpang ti inh pơlôch bơngai mă đơ̆ng Kră Yang tuh ăn đak rơmă! Inh apinh ih iŏk tơpu hăm get đak đơ̆ng kơ̆l giơng sư hăm get đak sư, đơ̆ng noh ba weh."
"So David took the spear and the jug of water by Saul’s head, and they got away; and no man saw or knew it or awoke. For they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from the LORD had fallen on them.","Na, Đawit iŏk tơju hăm get đak sư 'bơ̆t cheng kơ̆l sư, đơ̆ng noh bre sư weh, ưh kơ đe bu 'bôh dah băt păng kư̆m ưh kơ đe bu hơđơ̆r; yua kơ Kră Yang pơm ăn kơ lu sư tep blêk."
"Now David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of a hill afar off, a great distance being between them.","Na, Đawit tŏk hlôi pah to, pơdơh 'bơ̆t kơpal kơ̆l kông, ataih tơpă đơ̆ng kơđông linh sơlam lu sư."
"And David called out to the people and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, “Do you not answer, Abner?” Then Abner answered and said, “Who are you, calling out to the king?”","Đawit sư krao ôr lu linh Sôl păng Apner, kon drŏ-nglo Nêr, na khan: Apner ih ưh kơ tơl nơ̆r hă? Apner tơl: Ih bu na mă pơ̆n krao ôr pơtao?"
"So David said to Abner, “Are you not a man? And who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not guarded your lord the king? For one of the people came in to destroy your lord the king.","Đawit tơl Apner: Ih minh 'nu bơngai nuih pran dah kiơ?

"This thing that you have done is not good. As the LORD lives, you deserve to die, because you have not guarded your master, the LORD’s anointed. And now see where the king’s spear is, and the jug of water that was by his head.”","Ih pơm thoi noh ưh pă trŏ boih.

Na dang ei ih lăng lăng, tơju pơtao păng get đak 'bơ̆t kơ̆l tơ yơ boih?"
"Then Saul knew David’s voice, and said, “Is that your voice, my son David?” David said, “It is my voice, my lord, O king.”","Sôl kơnăl kơ 'bơ̆r Đawit, na jet khan: Ơ Đawit, kon inh, hăm trŏ kơ nơ̆r kon pơma noh? Đawit tơl khan: Ơ pơtao yŏng tơ'ngla inh, 'noh jơ̆ nơ̆r inh."
"And he said, “Why does my lord thus pursue his servant? For what have I done, or what evil is in my hand?","Sư pơma dơ̆ng: Yua kơ kiơ yŏng tơ'ngla inh druh 'moi wă rôp đĭch đam ih thoi noh? Inh đei pơm tơdrong kiơ păng tơpang ti inh đei pơm boih tơdrong yoch kơnê̆ yă kiơ?"
"Now therefore, please, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant: If the LORD has stirred you up against me, let Him accept an offering. But if it is the children of men, may they be cursed before the LORD, for they have driven me out this day from sharing in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, ‘Go, serve other gods.’","Dang ei apinh inh mơ̆ng bĕ nơ̆r đĭch đam ih roi.

"So now, do not let my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD. For the king of Israel has come out to seek a flea, as when one hunts a partridge in the mountains.”","Ô! Hơpơi rŏ kơ pham inh 'nĕ ăn ro kơpal teh ataih đơ̆ng muh măt Kră Yang; yua kơ kiơ pơtao lu bơngai Isơrael năm chă wă rôp inh, thoi minh pơm siso, nhen thoi đe druh sem trăk-tra? Lăm kông."
"Then Saul said, “I have sinned. Return, my son David. For I will harm you no more, because my life was precious in your eyes this day. Indeed I have played the fool and erred exceedingly.”","Sôl tơl: Inh đei tơdrong yoch tơpă Ơ Đawit, kon inh, wih brŏk bĕ!

"And David answered and said, “Here is the king’s spear. Let one of the young men come over and get it.","Đawit khan: 'Nâu tơju ih pơtao; wơh bĕ minh 'nu bơngai tơdăm năm tŏk pah âu na iŏk tơju ih."
"May the LORD repay every man for his righteousness and his faithfulness; for the LORD delivered you into my hand today, but I would not stretch out my hand against the LORD’s anointed.","Kră Yang gô apah ăn kơ rim 'nu, kiơ̆ thoi tơdrong 'lơ̆ng tơpăt đơ̆ng sư pơm.

"And indeed, as your life was valued much this day in my eyes, so let my life be valued much in the eyes of the LORD, and let Him deliver me out of all tribulation.”","Năr 'nâu inh lăng gĭt kơ tơdrong arih pơtao thoi yơ, na apinh Kră Yang kư̆m gô lăng gĭt kơ tơdrong arih kon thoi ei mơ̆n.

"Then Saul said to David, “May you be blessed, my son David! You shall both do great things and also still prevail.” So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.","Sôl tơl Đawit: Ơ Đawit, kon inh, hơpơi kơ Kră Yang ăn kơ kon đei pŭn hiôk!

"And David said in his heart, “Now I shall perish someday by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape to the land of the Philistines; and Saul will despair of me, to seek me anymore in any part of Israel. So I shall escape out of his hand.”","Đawit tơchĕng lăm đon khan: Tơpă lăm minh năr ayơ kơnh, inh gô lôch kơ tơpang ti Sôl.

"Then David arose and went over with the six hundred men who were with him to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath.","Thoi noh, Đawit iung năm hăm tơdrong hrĕng 'nu bơngai kiơ̆ sư, tŏk hlôi năm truh tơ Akis, sư pơtao Gat kon drŏ-nglo Maok."
"So David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, each man with his household, and David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal’s widow.","Đawit păng lu bơngai kiơ̆ sư oei hăm Akis tơ Gat, rim 'nu đei hnam dơnŏ lu sư kơdih. Đawit đei 'bar 'nu akăn kiơ̆, Ahinôam đơ̆ng Jêsreel păng Abigail, mă đêl akăn Nabal oei tơ Karmel."
"And it was told Saul that David had fled to Gath; so he sought him no more.","Sôl băt kơ Đawit ôn tơ Gat, na ưh pă druh chă 'moi wă rôp sư dơ̆ng."
"Then David said to Achish, “If I have now found favor in your eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there. For why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?”","Đawit pơma dơnuh hăm Akis: Tơdah ih mơnat kơ inh, apinh ih asong ăn kơ inh oei tơ minh pơlei ayơ 'nguaih kơ lu pơlei tih 'lơ̆ng, lê̆ inh oei tơ noh.

"So Achish gave him Ziklag that day. Therefore Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah to this day.","Lăm năr noh Akis asong ăn kơ Đawit oei tơ pơlei Siklak gah pơtao Juđa truh tơ dang ei."
"Now the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was one full year and four months.","Đawit oei lăm teh đak bơngai Philistin lăp minh sơnăm puăn khei."
"And David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites. For those nations were the inhabitants of the land from of old, as you go to Shur, even as far as the land of Egypt.","Đawit păng lu bơngai kiơ̆ sư năm blah iŏk teh bơngai Gêsurit, kon pơlei bơngai Girsi păng kon pơlei bơngai Amalek, lu bơngai mă oei đơ̆ng sơ̆ rok dêh Sur dĭng truh tơ dêh Êyiptơ."
"Whenever David attacked the land, he left neither man nor woman alive, but took away the sheep, the oxen, the donkeys, the camels, and the apparel, and returned and came to Achish.","Rim wơ̆t Đawit blah iŏk tơring ayơ, sư ưh kơ đei lê̆ minh 'nu bơngai drŏ-nglo dah bơngai drŏ-kăn mă oei arih.

"Then Achish would say, “Where have you made a raid today?” And David would say, “Against the southern area of Judah, or against the southern area of the Jerahmeelites, or against the southern area of the Kenites.”","Rim wơ̆t Akis jet: Năr 'nâu, ih năm blah tơgar iŏk tơring ayơ?

"David would save neither man nor woman alive, to bring news to Gath, saying, “Lest they should inform on us, saying, ‘Thus David did.’ ” And thus was his behavior all the time he dwelt in the country of the Philistines.","Đawit ưh kơ đei lê̆ minh 'nu bơngai drŏ-nglo dah bơngai drŏ-kăn mă oei arih wă chông ba brŏk tơ Gat; hli kơ lu sư gô roi kơ dôm tơdrong Đawit hăm lu bơngai kiơ̆ sư pơm.

"So Achish believed David, saying, “He has made his people Israel utterly abhor him; therefore he will be my servant forever.”","Akis lui kơ Đawit, na khan: Sư pơm ăn kơ lu bơngai Isơrael lăng sư krưp dêh, jơ̆ kon pơlei pơla sư, na sĭt tơpă sư gô pơm đĭch đam inh ling-lang ling-lang."
"Now it happened in those days that the Philistines gathered their armies together for war, to fight with Israel. And Achish said to David, “You assuredly know that you will go out with me to battle, you and your men.”","Kơplah ei, kon pơlei bơngai Philistin akŭm pơpôi jơhngơ̆m pran wă năm tơblah hăm bơngai Isơrael.

"So David said to Achish, “Surely you know what your servant can do.” And Achish said to David, “Therefore I will make you one of my chief guardians forever.”","Đawit tơl nơ̆r Akis: Pơtao gô 'bôh dôm tơdrong đĭch đam pơtao pơm. Akis khan kơ Đawit dơ̆ng: Na inh gô iŏk ih pơm đam kơiĕng inh ling-lang."
"Now Samuel had died, and all Israel had lamented for him and buried him in Ramah, in his own city. And Saul had put the mediums and the spiritists out of the land.","Kơplah noh, Samuel lôch boih đĭ lu bơngai Isơrael nhơ̆m hmoi kơ sư păng 'bŭ sư tơ Rama, pơlei sư kơdih.

"Then the Philistines gathered together, and came and encamped at Shunem. So Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped at Gilboa.","Thoi noh kon pơlei bơngai Philistin akŭm băl pơm kơđông tơ Sunem,a gah Sôl kư̆m krao akŭm đĭ-đăng lu bơngai Isơrael păng lu sư kư̆m pơm kơđông oei tơ Gilbôa."
"When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.","Sôl 'bôh lu linh lu bơngai Philistin, na hli păng lăm jơhngơ̆m tơtơ̆ dêh."
"And when Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD did not answer him, either by dreams or by Urim or by the prophets.","Sôl krao khan kơ Kră Yang; mă-lei Kră Yang ưh kơ đei tơl nơ̆r sư, lăm tơdrong apo, dah đơ̆ng Urim dah đơ̆ng 'bơ̆r lu bơngai khan lê̆ adrol."
"Then Saul said to his servants, “Find me a woman who is a medium, that I may go to her and inquire of her.” And his servants said to him, “In fact, there is a woman who is a medium at En Dor.”","Sôl khan kơ lu đĭch đam sư: Chơchă kơ inh minh 'nu bơngai drŏ-kăn pơjâu inh gô năm apinh sư, lu đĭch đam tơl: Tơ Ênđôr đei minh 'nu bơngai drŏ-kăn pơjâu."
"So Saul disguised himself and put on other clothes, and he went, and two men with him; and they came to the woman by night. And he said, “Please conduct a séance for me, and bring up for me the one I shall name to you.”","Sôl sư pơm wă kơ đe ưh kơnăl hrŭk ao nai, năm chông ba 'bar 'nu bơngai kiơ̆, năm truh tơ hnam bơngai drŏ-kăn kơmăng, Sôl khan: Apinh ih krao tơgŭm ăn kơ inh tơdrong wă truh păng krao bơhngol bơngai lôch mă inh gô roi kơ ih."
"Then the woman said to him, “Look, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off the mediums and the spiritists from the land. Why then do you lay a snare for my life, to cause me to die?”","Bơngai drŏ-kăn tơl: Ih băt hơđăl boih dôm tơdrong Sôl pơm, sư pơlôch pơđĭ lu bơngai mă pơm pơjâu. Na, liơ ih pơm hơđong wă pơlôch inh?"
"And Saul swore to her by the LORD, saying, “As the LORD lives, no punishment shall come upon you for this thing.”","Sôl pao anăn Kră Yang pơkă hăm bơngai drŏ-kăn: Inh pao anăn Kră Yang mă arih ling-lang pơkă, ih ưh kơ đei yoch kiơ lăm tơdrong jang 'nâu."
"Then the woman said, “Whom shall I bring up for you?” And he said, “Bring up Samuel for me.”","Bơngai drŏ-kăn jet: Inh krao bơngai bu 'bơ̆t anăp ih? Sôl tơl: Krao Samuel tŏk tơ âu."
"When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice. And the woman spoke to Saul, saying, “Why have you deceived me? For you are Saul!”","Wă bơngai drŏ-kăn noh 'bôh Samuel, na ôr hơdrăi 'bơ̆r re dêh pơma khan kơ Sôl: Yua kơ kiơ ih hơlĕnh kơ inh? Ih Sôl!"
"And the king said to her, “Do not be afraid. What did you see?” And the woman said to Saul, “I saw a spirit ascending out of the earth.”","Sôl pơlung sư: 'Nĕ kơ hli; roi ăn kơ inh 'bôh kiơ? Sư tơl: Inh 'bôh minh 'nu yang lĕch đơ̆ng teh"
"So he said to her, “What is his form?” And she said, “An old man is coming up, and he is covered with a mantle.” And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground and bowed down.","Sôl apinh ih 'bôh hơbŏ sư liơ? Bơngai drŏ-kăn tơl: Inh 'bôh minh 'nu 'bok kră hrŭk ao tai, Sôl băt noh Samuel, na kŭp kơ̆l drap tơ teh păng kơkuh."
"Now Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” And Saul answered, “I am deeply distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God has departed from me and does not answer me anymore, neither by prophets nor by dreams. Therefore I have called you, that you may reveal to me what I should do.”","Samuel jet Sôl: Yua kơ kiơ ih pơhrơ inh krao inh tŏk wă pơm kiơ?

"Then Samuel said: “So why do you ask me, seeing the LORD has departed from you and has become your enemy?","Samuel tơl: Yua kơ kiơ ih krao inh, yua kơ Kră Yang achăng lê̆ ih boih na jing ayăt kơ ih?"
"And the LORD has done for Himself as He spoke by me. For the LORD has torn the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbor, David.","Kră Yang pơm kiơ̆ thoi nơ̆r sư đei khan boih. Kră Yang pơdrâu iŏk teh đak đơ̆ng tơpang ti ih na ăn kơ bơngai nai noh jơ̆ Đawit."
"Because you did not obey the voice of the LORD nor execute His fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore the LORD has done this thing to you this day.","Ih ưh kơ chu kiơ̆ nơ̆r kư̆m ưh kơ pơm kiơ̆ phak lu bơngai Amalek kiơ̆ thoi tơdrong Kră Yang; hil mĭl thoi noh năr 'nâu Kră Yang pơm kơ ih thoi âu"
"Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with you into the hand of the Philistines. And tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. The LORD will also deliver the army of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.”","Kră Yang gô jao lu bơngai Isơrael păng ih lăm tơpang ti kon pơlei bơngai Philistin; năr dơning ih păng lu kon drŏ-nglo ih gô oei hăm inh. Kră Yang kư̆m gô jao lu linh bơngai Isơrael lăm tơpang ti kon pơlei bơngai Philistin."
"Immediately Saul fell full length on the ground, and was dreadfully afraid because of the words of Samuel. And there was no strength in him, for he had eaten no food all day or all night.","Sôl pơ̆k kơmŭ brum jơ'mrơh tơ teh, yua kơ dôm nơ̆r Samuel pơm kơ sư hli tơrơ; na mah kơtĕch jơhngơ̆m hloi, lăm năr noh păng măng noh sư ưh kơ đei sa kiơ."
"And the woman came to Saul and saw that he was severely troubled, and said to him, “Look, your maidservant has obeyed your voice, and I have put my life in my hands and heeded the words which you spoke to me.","Na, bơngai drŏ-kăn noh năm jê̆ Sôl, 'bôh sư hli, na khan: 'Nâu inh đĭch đam ih chu kiơ̆ nơ̆r ih.

"Now therefore, please, heed also the voice of your maidservant, and let me set a piece of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength when you go on your way.”","Dang ei ih kư̆m athei mơ̆ng bĕ dôm nơ̆r đĭch đam ih 'nâu: Inh hơmet dan 'bơ̆t anăp ih tơmam sa, ih sa bĕ wă kơ đei jơhngơ̆m pran, adrol kơ wă yak năm."
"But he refused and said, “I will not eat.” So his servants, together with the woman, urged him; and he heeded their voice. Then he arose from the ground and sat on the bed.","Sôl sơngah khan: Inh ưh kơ sa, mă-lei lu đĭch đam sư păng bơngai drŏ-kăn adrin pơlung sư dĭng sư chu kiơ̆ nơ̆r athei; sư iung đơ̆ng teh tŏk hơ-oei kơpal giơng."
"Now the woman had a fatted calf in the house, and she hastened to kill it. And she took flour and kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread from it.","Bơngai drŏ-kăn ei đei minh pơm kon rơmo bek, hăt hot 'bet pơlôch rơmo noh, na iŏk tơpŭng pơm 'bĕng ưh kơ đei 'buih pông."
"So she brought it before Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then they rose and went away that night.","Hơmet 'bơ̆t anăp Sôl păng lu đĭch đam sư; đang kơ sa lu sư iung păng yak năm lăm măng noh hloi."
"Then the Philistines gathered together all their armies at Aphek, and the Israelites encamped by a fountain which is in Jezreel.","Kon pơlei bơngai Philistin akŭm đĭ-đăng lu linh tơ Aphek; gah kon pơlei bơngai Isơrael pơm kơđông 'bơ̆t jê̆ glung Jesreel."
"And the lords of the Philistines passed in review by hundreds and by thousands, but David and his men passed in review at the rear with Achish.","Lu kră pơgơ̆r kon pơlei bơngai Philistin păng lu linh năm adrol minh-hrĕng 'nu minh-rơbâu 'nu gah Đawit păng lu bơngai kiơ̆ sư năm đơ̆ng rŏng hơdai hăm Akis."
"Then the princes of the Philistines said, “What are these Hebrews doing here?” And Achish said to the princes of the Philistines, “Is this not David, the servant of Saul king of Israel, who has been with me these days, or these years? And to this day I have found no fault in him since he defected to me.”","Na, lu bơngai yŏng pơgơ̆r kon pơlei pơla bơngai Philistin jet: Lu bơngai Hêbrơ pơm kiơ tơ âu?

"But the princes of the Philistines were angry with him; so the princes of the Philistines said to him, “Make this fellow return, that he may go back to the place which you have appointed for him, and do not let him go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become our adversary. For with what could he reconcile himself to his master, if not with the heads of these men?","Lu yŏng pơgơ̆r bơngai Philistin blĕk dêh, khan kơ Akis: Puh tơbrŏk lê̆ bơngai 'nâu tơ anih mă ih đei ăn kơ lu sư boih, 'nĕ ăn sư năm tơblah hơdai hăm lu bơ̆n, lăm năr tơblah kơnh hli kơ sư đei jơhngơ̆m ayăt hăm blah plơ̆ bơ̆n dơ̆ng; sư pơm wă pơhiôk kơ yŏng tơ'ngla so sư?

"Is this not David, of whom they sang to one another in dances, saying: ‘Saul has slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands’?”","Ih athei băt Đawit 'nâu boih mă lu adruh hơri suang khan: Sôl pơlôch rơbâu rơbâu 'nu đĕch, gah Đawit pơlôch mơjĭt-rơbâu rơbâu."
"Then Achish called David and said to him, “Surely, as the LORD lives, you have been upright, and your going out and your coming in with me in the army is good in my sight. For to this day I have not found evil in you since the day of your coming to me. Nevertheless the lords do not favor you.","Akis khŏm krao Đawit na khan: Đei Kră Yang mă arih ling-lang na sư inh pơkă khan, ih jơ̆ minh 'nu bơngai tơpăt, inh wă kơ sư mơ̆t lăm khŭl linh inh, yua kơ đơ̆ng năr ih oei hơdai inh dĭng truh tơ năr 'nâu, inh ưh kơ đei 'bôh ih pơm minh tơdrong kiơ kơnê̆.

"Therefore return now, and go in peace, that you may not displease the lords of the Philistines.”","Lei ih brŏk mă 'lơ̆ng. 'Nĕ kơ pơm kơ jơhngơ̆m lu yŏng pơgơ̆r bơngai Philistin sơ'ngon."
"So David said to Achish, “But what have I done? And to this day what have you found in your servant as long as I have been with you, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?”","Đawit pơma khan kơ Akis: Inh đei pơm tơdrong kiơ, na đơ̆ng năr inh oei hăm ih truh tơ năr 'nâu pơtao hăm đei 'bôh tơdrong kiơ đĭch đam ih âu mă pơm glăi, mă inh ưh kơ gơh năm tơblah bơngai ayăt kơ ih yŏng tơ'ngla inh."
"Then Achish answered and said to David, “I know that you are as good in my sight as an angel of God; nevertheless the princes of the Philistines have said, ‘He shall not go up with us to the battle.’","Akis tơl nơ̆r Đawit: Inh băt dôm tơdrong noh.

"Now therefore, rise early in the morning with your master’s servants who have come with you. And as soon as you are up early in the morning and have light, depart.”","Ih păng lu đĭch đam yŏng tơ'ngla ih lu bơngai mă đei năm kiơ̆ ih, athei iung đơ̆ng hrôih păng lăp 'năr hơdah năm hloi."
"So David and his men rose early to depart in the morning, to return to the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.","Na Đawit hăm lu bơngai kiơ̆ sư iung đơ̆ng hrôih, lăp 'năr wă hơdah pơgê dơ̆ng rŏng wơ̆t brŏk tơ dêh kon pơlei bơngai Philistin; gah kon pơlei Philistin tŏk năm tơ Jesreel."
"Now it happened, when David and his men came to Ziklag, on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the South and Ziklag, attacked Ziklag and burned it with fire","Đawit hăm lu bơngai kiơ̆ sư truh tơ Siklak, lăm năr mă pêng kon pơlei Amalek truh boih tơ gah gơal kơ pơlei Siklak, blah soh pơđĭ pơrăm pơlei noh"
"and had taken captive the women and those who were there, from small to great; they did not kill anyone, but carried them away and went their way.","lu sư rôp lu bơngai drŏ-kăn păng đĭ-đăng lu 'lơ̆p 'lŏ mă oei lăm noh. Lu sư ưh kơ đei pơlôch minh 'nu bơngai bu, sư chông ba pơđĭ pơm bơnă."
"So David and his men came to the city, and there it was, burned with fire; and their wives, their sons, and their daughters had been taken captive.","Wă Đawit hăm lu bơngai kiơ̆ sư truh mơ̆t lăm pơlei 'bôh pơlei ŭnh sa đĭ boih, kon akăn lu sư rôp chĕp ba pơm bơnă."
"Then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voices and wept, until they had no more power to weep.","Na Đawit hăm lu bơngai kiơ̆ sư nhơ̆m hmoi, nhơ̆m ôr dĭng pă kĕ kơ hmoi."
"And David’s two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite, had been taken captive.","'Bar 'nu akăn Đawit kư̆m rôp chĕp ba pơm bơnă mơ̆n, Ahinôam mă đơ̆ng Jêsreel păng Abigail đêl akăn Nabal mă oei tơ Karmel."
"Now David was greatly distressed, for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and his daughters. But David strengthened himself in the LORD his God.","Đawit đei tơdrong hli krưp tih dêh yua kơ lu bơngai kiơ̆ sư wă klơ̆m sư păng tơmo.

"Then David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech’s son, “Please bring the ephod here to me.” And Abiathar brought the ephod to David.","Na Đawit khan kơ 'bok soi Abiathar kon Ahimelek: Inh apinh ih chĕp ba ăn kơ inh êphot tơ âu: Abiathar chĕp ba êphot ăn kơ Đawit"
"So David inquired of the LORD, saying, “Shall I pursue this troop? Shall I overtake them?” And He answered him, “Pursue, for you shall surely overtake them and without fail recover all.”","Đawit krao apinh Kră Yang: Inh hăm gơh druh 'moi bơngai blah tơtông tơgar iŏk 'nâu ưh?

"So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and came to the Brook Besor, where those stayed who were left behind.","Đawit lĕch năm hăm tơdrâu-hrĕng 'nu kiơ̆ sư. Truh 'bơ̆t Thong Bêsôr, lu sư lap, đei 'bar-hrĕng 'nu pơdơh 'bơ̆t noh."
"But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred stayed behind, who were so weary that they could not cross the Brook Besor.","Mă-lei Đawit hăm puăn-hrĕng 'nu bơngai kiơ̆ sư oei yak năm; gah 'bar-hrĕng 'nu bơngai noh pơdơh kơ lap, yua kơ pă kĕ boih, ưh kơ kĕ yak hlôi kơ thong boih."
"Then they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David; and they gave him bread and he ate, and they let him drink water.","Linh Đawit tơ'bơ̆p minh 'nu bơngai Êyiptơ lăm chŭn, chông ba năm truh tơ Đawit, ăn kơ bơngai 'nâu 'bĕng sa đak nhă"
"And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two clusters of raisins. So when he had eaten, his strength came back to him; for he had eaten no bread nor drunk water for three days and three nights.","kư̆m ăn kơ sư minh tơpei 'bĕng plei hơra kro, păng 'bar hơie plei hơmu kro.

"Then David said to him, “To whom do you belong, and where are you from?” And he said, “I am a young man from Egypt, servant of an Amalekite; and my master left me behind, because three days ago I fell sick.","Đawit jet bơngai ei: Ih oei hăm bu?

"We made an invasion of the southern area of the Cherethites, in the territory which belongs to Judah, and of the southern area of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.”","Lu nhôn năm blah tơgar tơ teh goh gơal kon pơlei Kêrêthit, lăm dêh Juđa păng kư̆m năm blah tơgar tơ teh gah gơal kơ Kalep lu nhôn soh pơđĭ Siklak."
"And David said to him, “Can you take me down to this troop?” So he said, “Swear to me by God that you will neither kill me nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will take you down to this troop.”","Đawit jet: Ih hăm wă 'maih chông ba lu nhôn năm truh tơ lu đe noh?

"And when he had brought him down, there they were, spread out over all the land, eating and drinking and dancing, because of all the great spoil which they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah.","Bơngai Êyiptơ chông ba lu sư năm truh.

"Then David attacked them from twilight until the evening of the next day. Not a man of them escaped, except four hundred young men who rode on camels and fled.","Đawit blah lu sư đơ̆ng pơgê hrôih năr 'noh truh tơ kơsơ̆ năr đơ̆ng rŏng; na ưh kơ đei minh 'nu bơngai bu lĕch hlôi.

"So David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away, and David rescued his two wives.","Đawit dŏng pơklaih đĭ-đăng bơngai đêl bơngai Amalek blah rôp tơgar iŏk boih păng kư̆m dŏng pơklaih 'bar 'nu akăn sư hai."
"And nothing of theirs was lacking, either small or great, sons or daughters, spoil or anything which they had taken from them; David recovered all.","Ưh kơ đei hiong minh 'nu bơngai bu, 'lơ̆p dah 'lŏ drŏ-nglo dah drŏ-kăn, dah mă minh mŭk tơmam yă kiơ đêl kon pơlei Amalek tơgar iŏk, Đawit brŏk chĕp ba pơdrâu đĭ-đăng dôm tơmam noh"
"Then David took all the flocks and herds they had driven before those other livestock, and said, “This is David’s spoil.”","Đawit kư̆m rôp chĕp ba dơ̆ng lu rơmo păng triu, lu linh kiơ̆ Đawit năm adrol puh ba kơ lu sem dơrong 'nâu, păng pơkă khan: 'Nâu đơ̆ng Đawit blah pơdrâu iŏk."
"Now David came to the two hundred men who had been so weary that they could not follow David, whom they also had made to stay at the Brook Besor. So they went out to meet David and to meet the people who were with him. And when David came near the people, he greeted them.","Đawit brŏk truh tơ anih lu 'bar-hrĕng 'nu bơngai mă pơdơh kơ lap, ưh pă kĕ kiơ̆ lu sư, 'bơ̆t Thong Bêsôr, 'bar-hrĕng 'nu bơngai 'noh năm sơng Đawit păng lu bơngai linh kiơ̆ sư; Đawit năm jê̆ na jet lu sư hăm oei liĕm akâu ưh."
"Then all the wicked and worthless men of those who went with David answered and said, “Because they did not go with us, we will not give them any of the spoil that we have recovered, except for every man’s wife and children, that they may lead them away and depart.”","Mă-lei đei lu bơngai kơnê̆ mă kiơ̆ Đawit pơma rơ̆n khan: Yua kơ lu sư ưh kơ năm hơdai hăm lu bơ̆n, lu bơ̆n 'nĕ kơ asong lu sư đêl mŭk tơmam đêl mă lu bơ̆n blah tơgar iŏk, pơdrâu ăn kon akăn kơ lu sư đĕch!"
"But David said, “My brethren, you shall not do so with what the LORD has given us, who has preserved us and delivered into our hand the troop that came against us.","Mă-lei Đawit tơl: Ơ lu 'nhŏng oh, 'nĕ kơ pơm thoi noh gah tơmam mă Kră Yang hlôi asong ăn kơ lu bơ̆n; thoi yơ Sư wei rong bơ̆n hiôk-hian, pơjao ăn lăm ti lu bơ̆n lu linh năm blah bơ̆n."
"For who will heed you in this matter? But as his part is who goes down to the battle, so shall his part be who stays by the supplies; they shall share alike.”","Ưh kơ đei bơngai bu mơ̆ng kiơ̆ nơ̆r iĕm khan noh ôh.

"So it was, from that day forward; he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.","Đơ̆ng năr noh, Đawit pơjing dôm tơdrong noh, pơm tơdrong juăt lăm lu bơngai Isơrael kư̆m oei đei truh tơ dang ei."
"Now when David came to Ziklag, he sent some of the spoil to the elders of Judah, to his friends, saying, “Here is a present for you from the spoil of the enemies of the LORD”","Đawit wih brŏk tơ Siklak păng asong ăn tơmam kơ lu đe kră lăm dêh Juđa păng kư̆m gơih nơ̆r pơma khan: Gơih ăn kơ iĕm tơmam âu.

"to those who were in Bethel, those who were in Ramoth of the South, those who were in Jattir","Đawit asong ăn kơ lu bơngai kră mă oei tơ Bethel, Ramôt tơ Negep păng Jatir."

"those who were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were accustomed to rove.","Hêbrôn păng asong ăn jơ̆p-jang dêh mă đêl Đawit hăm lu bơngai linh kiơ̆ sư chă drong găn."
"Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell slain on Mount Gilboa.","Kon pơlei bơngai Philistin tơblah hăm lu bơngai Isơrael; bơngai Isơrael kơdâu thuơ ôn achăng pră lê̆ lu bơngai lôch tơ kông Gilbôa."
"Then the Philistines followed hard after Saul and his sons. And the Philistines killed Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, Saul’s sons.","Kon pơlei bơngai Philistin druh kiơ̆ 'moi Sôl hăm kon drŏ-nglo sư, pơlôch Jônathan, Abinađap păng Malkirsua lu kon Sôl."
"The battle became fierce against Saul. The archers hit him, and he was severely wounded by the archers.","Tơdrong tơblah druh pơm kơ Sôl dêh; lu linh chĕp hră prah 'bơm sư, sư jĭ rơka jĭ dêh."
"Then Saul said to his armorbearer, “Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised men come and thrust me through and abuse me.” But his armorbearer would not, for he was greatly afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword and fell on it.","Sôl khan kơ bơngai chĕp tơmam tơblah sư: Toh bĕ tơju ih, 'bet inh wăi, kơnh lu bơngai ưh kơ chu kăt tơdra akar 'bet inh păng gô che bơle kơ inh.

"And when his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword, and died with him.","Kơplah noh bơngai chĕp tơmam Sôl tơblah 'bôh Sôl lôch kư̆m iŏk đao glơ̆m akâu sư kơdih mơ̆n kư̆m lôch hơdai hăm Sôl"
"So Saul, his three sons, his armorbearer, and all his men died together that same day.","Thoi noh lăm năr noh pêng 'nu kon drŏ-nglo Sôl, bơngai mă chĕp tơmam tơblah Sôl păng đĭ-đăng lu bơngai kiơ̆ sư kư̆m wăng lôch hơdai."
"And when the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley, and those who were on the other side of the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.","Kơplah lu bơngai Isơrael oei pah to pŭng-lŭng păng pah to Krong Jôrđăn, 'bôh lu linh bơngai Isơrael kơdâu ôn, Sôl păng pêng 'nu kon drŏ-nglo sư lôch boih, na achăng lê̆ lu pơlei sư kơdih na năm kơdâu ôn; na lu kon pơlei bơngai Philistin truh iŏk oei tơ lăm lu pơlei noh."
"So it happened the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.","Năr đơ̆ng rŏng, kon pơlei Philistin truh năm chă pơpơih lu bơngai lôch, 'bôh Sôl păng pêng 'nu kon drŏ-nglo sư lôch jơ'mrơh kơpal kông Gilbôa."
"And they cut off his head and stripped off his armor, and sent word throughout the land of the Philistines, to proclaim it in the temple of their idols and among the people.","Lu sư kăt kơ̆l Sôl iŏk tơmam tơblah sư păng roi tơbăt ăn tơdrong 'lơ̆ng âu kơ jơ̆p-jang lăm dêh kon pơlei bơngai Philistin, lăm lu hnam kơkuh kơ rup yang lu sư păng lăm đĭ-đăng kon pơlei pơla sư."
"Then they put his armor in the temple of the Ashtoreths, and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth Shan.","Lu sư 'măn lê̆ đao Sôl tơ lăm hnam kơkuh kơ Yang Astarôt păng atol atâu sư 'bơ̆t dur pơlei Bêtsan."
"Now when the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul","Lu kon pơlei Jabes mă oei tơ Gileat băt kơ tơdrong mă kon pơlei Philistin pơm kơ Sôl."
"all the valiant men arose and traveled all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth Shan; and they came to Jabesh and burned them there.","Đĭ-đăng lu bơngai nuih pran iung năm kơmăng iŏk atâu akâu Sôl păng kon drŏ-nglo sư đơ̆ng dur pơlei Bêtsan, đơ̆ng noh lu sư wih brŏk tơ Jabes soh pơđĭ lu akâu Sôl păng pêng 'nu kon drŏ-nglo sư tơ noh"
"Then they took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.","iŏk kơting lu sư 'bŭ ala tơm 'long prai tơ Jabes păng ơ̆t kơ sŏng sa lăm tơpơh năr."
