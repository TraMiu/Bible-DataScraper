"Therefore all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the LORD. And they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.","Kơplah noh đĭ-đăng lu kră bơngai Isơrael năm tơ pơtao Đawit tơ Hêbrôn; na Đawit pơgơ̆p hloi hăm lu sư tơ Hêbrôn 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang; klaih kơ noh lu sư tuh đak rơmă 'bâu phu pôk Đawit pơm pơtao bơngai Isơrael thoi nơ̆r Kră Yang pơkă hăm Samuel."

"Now David said, “Whoever attacks the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain.” And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and became chief.","Đawit khan: “Bơngai bu blah kon pơlei Jêbus adrol, sư gô pơm yŏng pơm bơngai pơgơ̆r.” Na Jôap, kon drŏ-nglo Sêruia, năm tŏk blah adrol, na sư pơm yŏng pơgơ̆r."
"Then David dwelt in the stronghold; therefore they called it the City of David.","Đawit oei lăm kơđông 'noh; na đe krao pơlei Đawit."
"And he built the city around it, from the Millo to the surrounding area. Joab repaired the rest of the city.","Sư pơm pơlei jum dăr, đơ̆ng Milô; na Jôap sư pơm pơkeh lu pơlei tam mă pơm."
"So David went on and became great, and the LORD of hosts was with him.","Đawit rai đunh rai pran kơtang; yua kơ Kră Yang Tih Hloh oei hơdai sư."
"Now these were the heads of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.","'Nâu boih lu yŏng bơngai nuih pran kơtang, pơgơ̆r lu linh Đawit, tơgŭm hơdai hăm đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael, wă pơm kơ dêh char pơtao Đawit pran kơjăp, thoi nơ̆r Kră Yang đei pơkă."
"And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam the son of a Hachmonite, chief of the captains; he had lifted up his spear against three hundred, killed by him at one time.","'Nâu anăn dôm lu linh nuih pran kơtang kiơ̆ Đawit: Jahôbêam, kon drŏ-nglo Hakmôni, pơm yŏng kơ lu bơngai pơgơ̆r; 'noh bơngai yua đao tơju sư kơdih mă pơlôch pêng-hrĕng 'nu bơngai lăm minh 'măng."
"After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ sư Êlêasar kon drŏ-nglo Đôđô bơngai Ahôbit, minh 'nu lăm pêng 'nu, sư bơngai nuih pran kơtang hloh."
"He was with David at Pasdammim. Now there the Philistines were gathered for battle, and there was a piece of ground full of barley. So the people fled from the Philistines.","Sư oei hơdai hăm Đawit tơ Pas Đammim, lăp lu linh Philistin akŭm băl wă tơblah. Tơ noh đei na chŭn 'ba tơ'bâu, anih mă lu linh kơdâu kơ linh Philistin."
"But they stationed themselves in the middle of that field, defended it, and killed the Philistines. So the LORD brought about a great victory.","Mă-lei lu sư dơ̆ng lăm na chŭn blah drŭt lu linh Philistin kơdâu đĭ thoi noh Kră Yang ăn kĕ jei lu sư tih dêh tơpă."
"Now three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the army of the Philistines encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.","Lăm pêng-jĭt 'nu bơngai pơgơ̆r đei pêng 'nu bơngai năm jur tơ'bơ̆p Đawit lăm hơgơp tơmo tơ Ađulam, kơplah noh lu linh Philistin oei dơ̆ng pơm anih tơ lăm Thŭng Rêphaim."

"And David said with longing, “Oh, that someone would give me a drink of water from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!”","Đawit rơhing kơ đak na khan: “Ơ rŏ kơ đei bu năm ba kơ inh đak nhă đơ̆ng đak sơlŭng jê̆ 'măng jang pơlei Betlehem!”"
"So the three broke through the camp of the Philistines, drew water from the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate, and took it and brought it to David. Nevertheless David would not drink it, but poured it out to the LORD.","Na pêng 'nu bơngai 'nâu năm mơ̆t tơpăt kơđông linh Philistin sŏ iŏk đak đơ̆ng lăm sơlŭng jê̆ 'măng jang pơlei Betlehem, chĕp ba ăn kơ Đawit nhă mă-lei sư ưh kơ wă nhă, sư tuh hloi đak 'noh 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang"
"And he said, “Far be it from me, O my God, that I should do this! Shall I drink the blood of these men who have put their lives in jeopardy? For at the risk of their lives they brought it.” Therefore he would not drink it. These things were done by the three mighty men.","na khan: “Apinh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei wei inh ưh kơ pơm tơdrong 'nâu; liơ Inh gơh huch pham lu bơngai 'nâu, yua kơ lu sư hŭt akâu kơdih wă kơ iŏk đak âu.” Thoi noh, na Đawit ưh kơ chu nhă đak.

"Abishai the brother of Joab was chief of another three. He had lifted up his spear against three hundred men, killed them, and won a name among these three.","Abisai, oh Jôap pơm yŏng kơ pêng 'nu bơngai nuih kơtang; sư yua tơju na blah pơlôch pêng-hrĕng 'nu bơngai, na đe ư-ang anăn sư thoi pêng 'nu 'noh."
"Of the three he was more honored than the other two men. Therefore he became their captain. However he did not attain to the first three.","Lăm pêng 'nu bơngai nuih kơtang 'noh sư đe ư-ang hloh na pơm kơ̆l wei-lăng lu sư, mă-lei ưh kơ đei dang pêng 'nu bơngai adrol noh."
"Benaiah was the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man from Kabzeel, who had done many deeds. He had killed two lion-like heroes of Moab. He also had gone down and killed a lion in the midst of a pit on a snowy day.","Bênaia, kon drŏ-nglo Jêhôiada bơngai Kapsel, minh 'nu bơngai linh nuih kơtang đei pơm lơ tơdrong jang tih; sư pơlôch 'bar 'nu bơngai Môap mă pran kơtang hloh; lăm minh năr prĕl jruh sư jur năm tơ minh pôm sơlŭng pơlôch Dăm-brang."
"And he killed an Egyptian, a man of great height, five cubits tall. In the Egyptian’s hand there was a spear like a weaver’s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, wrested the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and killed him with his own spear.","Sư kư̆m pơlôch minh 'nu bơngai Êyiptơ kơjung 'bar hlok minh hơgăt mă bơngai Êyiptơ ti sư chĕp tơju tih tŏ 'long hơtơ̆ng brai, Bênaia năm tơblah sư chĕp minh pôm 'long tơnôn, na tơgar iŏk tơju đơ̆ng ti bơngai Êyiptơ na 'bet pơlôch bơngai noh."

"Then David and all Israel played music before God with all their might, with singing, on harps, on stringed instruments, on tambourines, on cymbals, and with trumpets.","Pơtao Đawit păng đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael đĭ jơhngơ̆m chơt hiôk 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei, hơri, reh brŏ, ot brŏ, teh hơgơ̆r iĕ, preh chhar păng hlôm keng hiôk chơt."
"And when they came to Chidon’s threshing floor, Uzza put out his hand to hold the ark, for the oxen stumbled.","Lăp lu sư truh tơ cham pơjuă 'ba Kiđôn, Usa hiŏng ti sư rôp hom pơgơ̆p, yua kơ rơmo kơtơih tơsĕr."
"Then the anger of the LORD was aroused against Uzza, and He struck him because he put his hand to the ark; and he died there before God.","Kră Yang hil dêh kơ Usa păng Kră Yang pơlôch hloi sư, yua kơ sư rôp 'bơm hom pơgơ̆p; na sư lôch hloi tơ noh 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei."
"And David became angry because of the LORD’s outbreak against Uzza; therefore that place is called Perez Uzza to this day.","Na Đawit ưh kơ lăp đon, yua kơ Kră Yang pơlôch Usa; sư krao anih noh Pêrês Usa, mă truh dang ei oei krao anăn 'noh."
"David was afraid of God that day, saying, “How can I bring the ark of God to me?”","Lăm 'năr 'noh, Đawit hli kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei na apinh khan: “Lơliơ Inh gơh iŏk Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei tơmơ̆t tơ hnam inh?”"
"So David would not move the ark with him into the City of David, but took it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.","Na Đawit ưh kơ tung iŏk Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei tơmơ̆t tơ lăm hnam sư tơ lăm pơlei Đawit, mă-lei tung ba Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei tơ lăm hnam Ôbêt Eđôm, bơngai Gitit."
"The ark of God remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obed-Edom and all that he had.","Hom pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lăm hnam Ôbêt Eđôm pêng khei Kră Yang tuh tơdrong pŭn hiôk lăm hnam Ôbêt Eđôm păng dôm tơmam sư đei."
"Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, with masons and carpenters, to build him a house.","Hiram, pơtao Tirơ, wơh bơngai năm tơ pơtao Đawit, hăm gơih ăn kơ sư 'long hơngo, bơngai man, bơngai jang 'long, wă pơm hnam pơtao ăn kơ sư."
"So David knew that the LORD had established him as king over Israel, for his kingdom was highly exalted for the sake of His people Israel.","Đawit băt kơ Kră Yang ăn kơ sư pơm pơtao lu bơngai Isơrael. Teh đak sư rai tih rai să yua kơ Isơrael kon pơlei Kră Yang."
"Then David took more wives in Jerusalem, and David begot more sons and daughters.","Lăm Jêrusalem Đawit đei iŏk lơ akăn plơ̆ng, păng pơjing kơ lơ kon drŏ-nglo kon drŏ-kăn."
"And these are the names of his children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon","'Nâu anăn lu kon sư pơjing tơ Jêrusalem: Sammua, Sôbap, Nathan, Sôlômôn"
"Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet","Iphar, Êlisua, Êlpêlek"
"Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia","Nôga, Nêphet, Japhia"
"Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.","Êlisama, Bêeliađa păng Êliphêlet."
"Now when the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to search for David. And David heard of it and went out against them.","Lăp kon pơlei Philistin kơtơ̆ng Đawit đe tuh pơgang 'bâu phu pôk pơm pơtao kơ đĭ-đăng lu bơngai Isơrael, na đĭ-đăng bơngai Philistin năm chă sư; pơtao Đawit kơtơ̆ng tơdrong noh, sư năm sơng hloi lu sư."
"Then the Philistines went and made a raid on the Valley of Rephaim.","Kon pơlei Philistin năm truh, blah pơrăm Thŭng Rêphaim."
"And David inquired of God, saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will You deliver them into my hand?” The LORD said to him, “Go up, for I will deliver them into your hand.”","Đawit krao apinh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei khan: “Inh hăm gơh năm blah kon pơlei Philistin ưh?

"So they went up to Baal Perazim, and David defeated them there. Then David said, “God has broken through my enemies by my hand like a breakthrough of water.” Therefore they called the name of that place Baal Perazim.","Na Đawit hăm lu buăl sư tŏk năm tơ Baal Phêrasim, na tơ noh Đawit blah lu linh Philistin jei sư; Đawit khan: “Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei đei yua ti inh blah pơchah lê̆ lu bơngai ayăt kơ inh, nhen thoi đak blŭng kơ bơnơ̆ pơchah.” Thoi noh na đe krao anih noh Baal Pêrasim."
"And when they left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.","Bơngai Philistin achăng hŭt lê̆ lu rup yang lu sư tơ anih 'noh; na Đawit athei soh pơđĭ lê̆ lăm ŭnh."
"Then the Philistines once again made a raid on the valley.","Lu bơngai Philistin năm pơrăm lăm thŭng dơnă."
"Therefore David inquired again of God, and God said to him, “You shall not go up after them; circle around them, and come upon them in front of the mulberry trees.","Na Đawit krao apinh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei dơ̆ng; Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei tơl nơ̆r sư: “Ih 'nĕ kơ năm tơpăt lu sư, athei năm dăr đơ̆ng rŏng na blah lu sư tơ anăp kơdrơ̆ng 'long hơngo bri."
"And it shall be, when you hear a sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, then you shall go out to battle, for God has gone out before you to strike the camp of the Philistines.”","Lăp ih kơtơ̆ng jơ̆ng sư nơnăm yak lăm kơdrơ̆ng 'long hơngo bri, lei ih năm blah hloi, yua kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei năm adrol kơ ih wă tơblah lu linh Philistin.”"
"So David did as God commanded him, and they drove back the army of the Philistines from Gibeon as far as Gezer.","Na Đawit pơm thoi nơ̆r Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei pơkă ăn; păng lu sư blah pơrăm lu linh Philistin đơ̆ng Gibeôn truh tơ Geser."
"Then the fame of David went out into all lands, and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations.","Anăn Đawit kơtơ̆ng ư-ang jơ̆p-jang kơ teh đak; Kră Yang pơm ăn kơ lu khŭl kon pơlei pơla hli kơ Đawit."
"David built houses for himself in the City of David; and he prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched a tent for it.","Đawit pơm hnam pơtao kơ sư kơdih lăm pơlei Đawit păng hơmet lê̆ minh anih wă 'măn Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei."
"Then David said, “No one may carry the ark of God but the Levites, for the LORD has chosen them to carry the ark of God and to minister before Him forever.”","Kơplah noh Đawit khan 'nguaih kơ bơngai Lêwi, ưh kơ đei bơngai bu gơh tung Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei, yua kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei rơih iŏk boih lu sư wă tung Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei păng bơ̆jang kơ Kră Yang ling-lang."

"Then David assembled the children of Aaron and the Levites","Đawit krao akŭm lu kon sâu Arôn păng Lêwi."

"And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites: for Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab.","Đawit krao 'bok soi Sađok, Abiathar păng lu bơngai Lêwi đei Uriel, Asaia, Jôel, Sêmaia, Êliel păng Aminađap."
"He said to them, “You are the heads of the fathers’ houses of the Levites; sanctify yourselves, you and your brethren, that you may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel to the place I have prepared for it.","Sư khan kơ đe noh: “Lu iĕm bơngai yŏng pơgơ̆r lăm adrĕch adrung Lêwi; iĕm athei hơmet akâu iĕm hăm lu 'nhŏng oh iĕm mă 'lơ̆ng rơgoh wă tung Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael ba tơ anih mă inh đei hơmet lê̆ boih."
"For because you did not do it the first time, the LORD our God broke out against us, because we did not consult Him about the proper order.”","Yua kơ adrol ki, lu iĕm ưh kơ tung ba hom Kră Yang yua kơ lu bơ̆n ưh kơ đei krao apinh Sư thoi Sư đei pơkă, na Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei hil mĭl pơrăm lê̆ lu bơ̆n.”"
"So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.","Na lu 'bok soi păng bơngai Lêwi hơmet akâu kơdih 'lơ̆ng rơgoh na tung ba Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael."
"And the children of the Levites bore the ark of God on their shoulders, by its poles, as Moses had commanded according to the word of the LORD.","Lu bơngai Lêwi iŏk 'long tơnung tung Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei tơ kơpal hơngiĕng, thoi Môis bơtho khan kiơ̆ kơ nơ̆r Kră Yang."

"Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, were to blow the trumpets before the ark of God; and Obed-Edom and Jehiah, doorkeepers for the ark.","Sêbania, Jôsaphat, Nêthanêl, Amasai, Sachari, Bênaia, păng Êliêser, lu 'bok soi, hlôm keng 'bơ̆t anăp Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei.

"So David, the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the house of Obed-Edom with joy.","Na, Đawit, lu kră bơngai Isơrael păng lu yŏng pơgơ̆r minh-rơbâu linh, năm tung ba Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei đơ̆ng hnam Ôbêt Eđôm hăm tơdrong hiôk chơt."
"And so it was, when God helped the Levites who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bulls and seven rams.","Yua kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei tơgŭm lu bơngai Lêwi tung ba Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang, na pơyơ̆r tơmam soi tơpơh tŏ rơmo tơno, păng tơpơh tŏ triu tơno."
"David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who bore the ark, the singers, and Chenaniah the music master with the singers.

"Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting and with the sound of the horn, with trumpets and with cymbals, making music with stringed instruments and harps.","Na đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael năm tung Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang hăm nơ̆r jreo tơkĕch hiôk chơt, kơtơ̆ng jơwa hlôm keng păng jơwa tơgiĕp preh chhar reh tĭng-nĭng păng brŏ dung."
"And it happened, as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the City of David, that Michal, Saul’s daughter, looked through a window and saw King David whirling and playing music; and she despised him in her heart.","Lăp Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang truh mơ̆t tơ lăm pơlei Đawit, na Mikal, kon drŏ-kăn Sôl, lăng đơ̆ng 'măng-'mŏk, 'bôh pơtao Đawit yŭn suang hiôk chơt, na lăm jơhngơ̆m sư areh ưh kơ lăp đon."
"So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tabernacle that David had erected for it.

"he sent Hadoram his son to King David, to greet him and bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him (for Hadadezer had been at war with Tou); and Hadoram brought with him all kinds of articles of gold, silver, and bronze.","Tou pơtao Hamat wơh kon drŏ-nglo sư Hadôram năm tơ pơtao Đawit kơkuh bơnê kơ sư yua tơblah hăm Hadadêser jei sư; Hadadêser kư̆m ngăl tơblah hăm Tou ling-lang.

"Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David’s sons were chief ministers at the king’s side.","Bênaia kon drŏ-nglo Jêhôiada pơgơ̆r lu bơngai Kêrêthit hăm lu Pêlithit; lu kon drŏ-nglo Đawit jing yŏng pơgơ̆r lăm tơdrong jang pơtao."
"It happened after this that Nahash the king of the people of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his place.","Đunh 'biơ̆ đơ̆ng noh Nahas pơtao Ammôn lôch. Kon drŏ-nglo sư pơm pơtao pơgơ̆r pơtrơp sư."
"Then David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And David’s servants came to Hanun in the land of the people of Ammon to comfort him.","Đawit khan: “Inh gô pơm 'lơ̆ng hăm Hanun kon drŏ-nglo Nahas, yua kơ 'bă sư pơm 'lơ̆ng hăm inh.” Na Đawit wơh lu bơngai năm hơpong wă pơlung sư, yua kơ đei tơdrong truh kơ 'bă sư.

"And the princes of the people of Ammon said to Hanun, “Do you think that David really honors your father because he has sent comforters to you? Did his servants not come to you to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land?”","Mă-lei lu yŏng linh Ammôn khan kơ Hanun: “Ih ngeh kơ Đawit wơh lu bơngai năm ngôi pơlung ih, wă pơyom kơ 'bă ih hă?

"Therefore Hanun took David’s servants, shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, at their buttocks, and sent them away.","Thoi noh Hanun rôp lu jơ̆ng 'bang Đawit hơkôih lê̆ sŏk kang, hăm kăt lê̆ ao sư minh puăt truh tơ kơiĕng đang kơ noh tơbrŏk lu sư wih."
"Then some went and told David about the men; and he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, “Wait at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return.”","Đe roi kơ Đawit tơdrong truh kơ đe noh, sư wơh bơngai năm sơng lu đe noh, yua kơ lu đe noh mơlâu dêh păng pơtao khan: “Lu iĕm oei tơ pơlei Jêrikô dĭng sŏk kang iĕm bluh 'mơ̆i na lu iĕm brŏk.”"
"When the people of Ammon saw that they had made themselves repulsive to David, Hanun and the people of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire for themselves chariots and horsemen from Mesopotamia, from Syrian Maacah, and from Zobah.","Lu bơngai Ammôn băt tơdrong sư pơm ăn kơ Đawit 'bâu chhok.

"So they hired for themselves thirty-two thousand chariots, with the king of Maacah and his people, who came and encamped before Medeba. Also the people of Ammon gathered together from their cities, and came to battle.","Lu sư apah pêng-jĭt 'bar-rơbâu gre aseh, bơngai chĕp gre aseh, pơtao Maaka hăm lu linh sư; lu sư năm pơm kơđông jê̆ tơ pơlei Mêdêba, lu đe Ammôn đơ̆ng lu pơlei lu sư năm akŭm băl păng lĕch năm tơblah."
"Now when David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the army of the mighty men.","Đawit kơtơ̆ng thoi noh na sư wơh Jôap hăm đĭ-đăng lu linh nuih pran sư."
"Then the people of Ammon came out and put themselves in battle array before the gate of the city, and the kings who had come were by themselves in the field.","Lu bơngai Ammôn lĕch năm tơblah 'bơ̆t 'măng jang pơlei, lu pơtao nai sư oei dan linh sư tơ lăm bri tơmăn."
"When Joab saw that the battle line was against him before and behind, he chose some of Israel’s best and put them in battle array against the Syrians.","Jôap 'bôh đe dă linh gah anăp gah rŏng sư, sư rơih lu linh hơgei đơ̆ng lăm bơngai Isơrael, năm găn tơblah hăm lu linh Siri."
"And the rest of the people he put under the command of Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in battle array against the people of Ammon.","Oei đei lu linh sư pơjao ăn kơ oh sư Abisai răp tơblah hăm lu bơngai Ammôn."
"Then he said, “If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the people of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will help you.","Jôap khan: “Mưh linh Siri pran hloh kơ ĭnh, ih năm dŏng inh; mă-lei mưh linh Ammôn pran hloh kơ ih, inh gô năm dŏng ih."
"Be of good courage, and let us be strong for our people and for the cities of our God. And may the LORD do what is good in His sight.”","Athei mă nuih pran kơtang bĕ tơblah ăn kơ kon pơlei pơla bơ̆n păng kơ pơlei Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei bơ̆n, Kră Yang gô pơm tơdrong kiơ 'lơ̆ng kiơ̆ thoi măt sư lăng lăp.”"
"So Joab and the people who were with him drew near for the battle against the Syrians, and they fled before him.","Thoi noh Jôap hăm lu linh hơdai sư năm blah lu linh Siri; lu linh Siri kơdâu đĭ 'bơ̆t anăp lu sư."
"When the people of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fleeing, they also fled before Abishai his brother, and entered the city. So Joab went to Jerusalem.","Khŭl linh Ammôn 'bôh lu linh Siri kơdâu boih, lu sư kư̆m kơdâu đơ̆ng anăp Abisai oh Jôap, lu sư mơ̆t lăm pơlei, na Jôap brŏk tơ pơlei Jêrusalem."
"Now when the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent messengers and brought the Syrians who were beyond the River, and Shophach the commander of Hadadezer’s army went before them.","Wă lu bơngai Siri 'bôh jei linh Isơrael lu sư thuơ boih, lu sư wơh bơngai năm sơng lu linh Siri gah to đak Krong Ơphrat đei Sophach yŏng linh Hadadêser jing bơngai ba trong lu sư."
"When it was told David, he gathered all Israel, crossed over the Jordan and came upon them, and set up in battle array against them. So when David had set up in battle array against the Syrians, they fought with him.","Mưh đe roi kơ Đawit tơdrong noh sư pơpôi akŭm đĭ-đăng lu linh bơngai Isơrael tŏk kơ đak Krong Jôrđăn năm tơblah, pơrĕng lu linh sư tơklă lu linh wă tơblah lu ayăt.

"Then the Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed seven thousand charioteers and forty thousand foot soldiers of the Syrians, and killed Shophach the commander of the army.","Lu linh Siri kơdâu kơ lu linh Isơrael Đawit pơlôch tơpơh-rơbâu 'nu linh hao gre aseh, puăn-jĭt rơbâu 'nu linh Siri yak jơ̆ng, pơlôch hloi Sôphach yŏng linh lu sư."
"And when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became his servants. So the Syrians were not willing to help the people of Ammon anymore.","Mưh lu pơtao kiơ̆ Hadadêser 'bôh lu sư thuơ kơ lu bơngai Isơrael, lu sư apinh pơgơ̆p hiôk-hian hăm Đawit kiơ̆ sư.

"It happened in the spring of the year, at the time kings go out to battle, that Joab led out the armed forces and ravaged the country of the people of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem. And Joab defeated Rabbah and overthrew it.","Bơyan choh pơtăm lăm sơnăm noh kơplah lu pơtao lĕch năm wă tơblah, Jôap ba lu linh pơrăm lăm char Ammôn, sư năm wang pơlei Rapba mă-lei Đawit oei tơ pơlei Jêrusalem. Jôap blah pơlei Rapba păng pơrăm đĭ-đăng."
"Then David took their king’s crown from his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it. And it was set on David’s head. Also he brought out the spoil of the city in great abundance.","Đawit plôh iŏk môk pơtao đơ̆ng kơ̆l pơtao lu sư, trăp pêng-jĭt puăn kĭ maih, yơ̆l kơpal kơ̆l pơtao lăm môk pơtao noh tah găr tơmo gĭt, đe pơyơ̆l môk pơtao noh tơ kơpal kơ̆l Đawit, sư đei blah tơgar iŏk tơmam đơ̆ng lăm pơlei lơ dêh."
"And he brought out the people who were in it, and put them to work with saws, with iron picks, and with axes. So David did to all the cities of the people of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.","Sư chông ba lu kon pơlei đơ̆ng pơlei noh, ăn kơ lu sư bơ̆jang hăm hơnuă, hăm hơbol bơsei păng sung bơsei.

"Now it happened afterward that war broke out at Gezer with the Philistines, at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite killed Sippai, who was one of the sons of the giant. And they were subdued.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ noh đei tơdrong tơblah hăm lu bơngai Philistin tơ pơlei Geser.

"Again there was war with the Philistines, and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.","Păng đei tơblah dơ̆ng hăm lu bơngai Philistin; Êlhanan kon drŏ-nglo Jair pơlôch Lahmi oh drŏ-nglo Gôliat minh 'nu bơngai Gitit.

"Yet again there was war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, with twenty-four fingers and toes, six on each hand and six on each foot; and he also was born to the giant.","Đei minh tơdrong tơblah dơ̆ng tơ pơlei Gat.

"So when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, David’s brother, killed him.","Sư blei hiap bơngai Isơrael mă-lei Jônathan kon drŏ-nglo Simêa 'nhŏng Đawit pơlôch sư."
"These were born to the giant in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.","Lu bơngai 'nâu lu kon sâu bơngai Rapha lăm pơlei Gat. Lu sư lôch kơ Đawit păng lu linh sư pơlôch."
"Now Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel.","Yang Satan iung pơm kơ Isơrael păng pơdrŭt Đawit wă kơ jô̆ kơ̆l bơngai Isơrael."
"So David said to Joab and to the leaders of the people, “Go, number Israel from Beersheba to Dan, and bring the number of them to me that I may know it.”","Đawit khan kơ Jôap păng lu yŏng pơgơ̆r linh sư: Năm jô̆ bĕ đĭ lu bơngai Isơrael, đơ̆ng pơlei Bêrsêba truh tơ char Đan. Brŏk roi kơ inh. Wă kơ inh băt dôm yơ lu sư."
"And Joab answered, “May the LORD make His people a hundred times more than they are. But, my lord the king, are they not all my lord’s servants? Why then does my lord require this thing? Why should he be a cause of guilt in Israel?”","Mă-lei Jôap khan: “Apinh Kră Yang pơthim kon pơlei pơla Sư minh-hrĕng wơ̆t lơ hloh! Ơ yŏng pơtao inh, ưh kơ trŏ đĭ-đăng lu sư jing kon pơlei ih hă? Yua kơ kiơ ih wă pơm tơdrong âu? Ih wă kơ bơngai Isơrael pơm yoch hă?”"
"Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed and went throughout all Israel and came to Jerusalem.","Mă-lei jei nơ̆r pơtao tơtă hloh kơ nơ̆r Jôap găn, na Jôap năm tơ jơ̆p-jang kơ dêh char Isơrael wơ̆t brŏk dơ̆ng tơ pơlei Jêrusalem"
"Then Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to David. All Israel had one million one hundred thousand men who drew the sword, and Judah had four hundred and seventy thousand men who drew the sword.","Jôap roi ăn gơsô̆ kơ̆l kon bơngai kơ pơtao Đawit.

"But he did not count Levi and Benjamin among them, for the king’s word was abominable to Joab.","Mă-lei tam mă đei jô̆ ôh bơngai Lêwi hăm Bênjamin yua kơ Jôap lăng krưp dêh kơ nơ̆r pơtao tơtă."
"And God was displeased with this thing; therefore He struck Israel.","Nơ̆r tơtă âu jơ̆ minh nơ̆r tơtă kơnê̆ dêh 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei na sư phak pơmat lu bơngai Isơrael."
"So David said to God, “I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing; but now, I pray, take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have done very foolishly.”","Đawit hơdrĭ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei na khan: “Inh pơm yoch tih dêh bơih inh pơm tơdrong âu. Apinh ih 'nĕ jô̆ kơ tơdrong yoch đơ̆ng đĭch đam Ih, yua kơ inh pơm hăm tơdrong kơhlôh dêh.”"
"Then the LORD spoke to Gad, David’s seer, saying","Kră Yang khan kơ Gat, bơngai khan lê̆ adrol kơ Đawit."
"“Go and tell David, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD: “I offer you three things; choose one of them for yourself, that I may do it to you.” ’ ”","“Năm khan bĕ kơ Đawit: Kră Yang khan thoi âu. Inh ăn kơ ih pêng tơdrong: Rơih iŏk bĕ minh lăm pêng tơdrong noh wă kơ Inh pơm.”"
"So Gad came to David and said to him, “Thus says the LORD: ‘Choose for yourself","Gat năm roi kơ Đawit. Kră Yang khan. ‘Ih athei rơih iŏk.’"
"either three years of famine, or three months to be defeated by your foes with the sword of your enemies overtaking you, or else for three days the sword of the LORD—the plague in the land, with the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the territory of Israel.’ Now consider what answer I should take back to Him who sent me.”","Pêng sơnăm pơngot rơwĕt dah pêng khei đei lu ayăt blah pơrăm đĭ, dah pêng năr đei đao gưm Kră Yang phak, đei tơdrong jĭ lôch hơbuh lăm char ih, linh jang 'lơ̆ng đơ̆ng Kră Yang pơrăm jơ̆p-jang dêh char Isơrael.

"And David said to Gad, “I am in great distress. Please let me fall into the hand of the LORD, for His mercies are very great; but do not let me fall into the hand of man.”","“Đawit khan kơ Gat.

"So the LORD sent a plague upon Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell.","Na Kră Yang ăn tơdrong jĭ lôch hơbuh truh tơ lu bơngai Isơrael; đei tơpơh-jĭt rơbâu 'nu drŏ-nglo Isơrael lôch."
"And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it. As he was destroying, the LORD looked and relented of the disaster, and said to the angel who was destroying, “It is enough; now restrain your hand.” And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.","Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei wơh linh jang 'lơ̆ng năm pơrăm pơlei Jêrusalem.

"Then David lifted his eyes and saw the angel of the LORD standing between earth and heaven, having in his hand a drawn sword stretched out over Jerusalem. So David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.","Đawit lăng 'bôh linh jang 'lơ̆ng Kră Yang dơ̆ng tŏk-bŏk teh hăm plĕnh. Ti sư chĕp đao yơ̆r tơ gah pơlei Jêrusalem.

"And David said to God, “Was it not I who commanded the people to be numbered? I am the one who has sinned and done evil indeed; but these sheep, what have they done? Let Your hand, I pray, O LORD my God, be against me and my father’s house, but not against Your people that they should be plagued.”","Đawit Krao Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei: “Hăm trŏ inh athei đe jô̆ kon pơlei?

"Therefore, the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David that David should go and erect an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.","Kơplah noh linh jang 'lơ̆ng Kră Yang khan kơ Gat athei khan kơ Đawit: Ih athei năm pơm minh pôm chơnang soi kơ Kră Yang tơ anih pơjuă 'ba Ôrnan bơngai Jêbus.”"
"So David went up at the word of Gad, which he had spoken in the name of the LORD.","Thoi noh Đawit tŏk năm kiơ̆ thoi Gat khan hăm anăn Kră Yang."
"Now Ornan turned and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves, but Ornan continued threshing wheat.","Ôrnan oei pơjuă 'ba, sư lăng tơ rŏng 'bôh linh jang 'lơ̆ng, puăn 'nu kon drŏ-nglo sư oei kơdâu ôn."
"So David came to Ornan, and Ornan looked and saw David. And he went out from the threshing floor, and bowed before David with his face to the ground.","Đawit năm tơ Ôrnan, Ôrnan lăng wă 'bôh Đawit sư lĕch đơ̆ng anih pơjuă 'ba păng drap bon kơkuh kơ Đawit."
"Then David said to Ornan, “Grant me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar on it to the LORD. You shall grant it to me at the full price, that the plague may be withdrawn from the people.”","Đawit khan kơ Ôrnan: “Tĕch ăn kơ inh anih pơjuă 'ba âu, inh wă man chơnang soi kơ Kră Yang 'bơ̆t âu wă kơ tơdrong lôch hơbuh huay pă truh kơ kon pơlei pơla. Inh răt kiơ̆ kơ ih lăp.”"
"But Ornan said to David, “Take it to yourself, and let my lord the king do what is good in his eyes. Look, I also give you the oxen for burnt offerings, the threshing implements for wood, and the wheat for the grain offering; I give it all.”","Ôrnan drơ̆ng Đawit: “Iŏk wăi.

"Then King David said to Ornan, “No, but I will surely buy it for the full price, for I will not take what is yours for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings with that which costs me nothing.”","Pơtao Đawit tơl Ôrnan. “Ưh ôh inh ưh kơ wă ôh iŏk tơmam ih wă pơyơ̆r kơ Kră Yang inh gô ăn jên tôm, inh ưh kơ gơh ôh gô pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'buh mă ưh kơ huach kiơ.”"
"So David gave Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the place.","Thoi noh Đawit ăn tơdrâu-hrĕng Seikơl maiha wă răt anih noh."
"And David built there an altar to the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called on the LORD; and He answered him from heaven by fire on the altar of burnt offering.","Đawit pơm minh pôm chơnang soi kơ Kră Yang tơ noh păng pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'buh păng pơyơ̆r tơmam soi apinh hiôk hiam, krao apinh Kră Yang, Kră Yang tơl tơwih kơ sư hăm ŭnh đơ̆ng plĕnh huŏng 'bơ̆t kơpal chơnang soi pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'buh."
"So the LORD commanded the angel, and he returned his sword to its sheath.","Kră Yang athei linh jang 'lơ̆ng, tah lê̆ đao lăm hơnglop sư."
"At that time, when David saw that the LORD had answered him on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he sacrificed there.","Kơplah Đawit 'bôh Kră Yang tơl tơwih boih nơ̆r sư krao apinh tơ anih pơjuă 'ba Ôrnan bơngai Jêbus, sư pơyơ̆r tơmam soi tơ noh."
"For the tabernacle of the LORD and the altar of the burnt offering, which Moses had made in the wilderness, were at that time at the high place in Gibeon.","Yua kơ lăm chăl noh bơsŭn anih akŭm Kră Yang mă Môis đei pơm tơ lăm char glă, păng chơnang soi tơmam soi 'buh tơ anih kơjung tơ pơlei Gibeôn"
"But David could not go before it to inquire of God, for he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the LORD.","Đawit ưh kơ gơh năm tơ noh wă krao apinh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua kơ sư hli kơ đao gưm linh jang 'lơ̆ng Kră Yang."
"Then David said, “This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of burnt offering for Israel.”","Na Đawit khan. “'Bơ̆t âu gô pơm hnam Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei; păng 'bơ̆t âu boih anih chơnang soi 'buh kơ lu bơngai Isơrael.”"
"So David commanded to gather the aliens who were in the land of Israel; and he appointed masons to cut hewn stones to build the house of God.","Đawit krao akŭm lu bơngai tơmoi oei lăm char Isơrael sư pơkă kơ lu bơngai teh blah tơmo wă pơm hnam Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei."
"And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails of the doors of the gates and for the joints, and bronze in abundance beyond measure","Pơtao Đawit ăn lơ bơsei wă pơm kơđĭnh pơm, măng jang, pơm lu gơwŏk sư ăn kong đei lơlap ưh kơ kĕ jô̆."
"and cedar trees in abundance; for the Sidonians and those from Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.","Sư ăn 'long hơngo kư̆m ưh kơ kĕ jô̆ ôh yua kơ lu bơngai Siđôn hăm lu bơngai Tirơ chơ ba lơ dêh 'long hơngo ăn kơ Đawit."
"Now David said, “Solomon my son is young and inexperienced, and the house to be built for the LORD must be exceedingly magnificent, famous and glorious throughout all countries. I will now make preparation for it.” So David made abundant preparations before his death.","Đawit khan: Sôlômôn kon drŏ-nglo inh oei tơdăm tam mă gơh jang ôh, mă pơm hnam Kră Yang athei pơm 'lơ̆ng rŏ krưp tơpă, đei tơdrong ư-ang, tơ jơ̆p-jang char, na inh gô chă hơmet lê̆ adrol.

"Then he called for his son Solomon, and charged him to build a house for the LORD God of Israel.","Sư krao Sôlômôn kon drŏ-nglo sư păng pơkă kơ sư athei pơm hnam kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael."
"And David said to Solomon: “My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build a house to the name of the LORD my God","Đawit khan kơ Sôlômôn: “Ơ dăm, jơhngơ̆m inh 'maih pơm hnam kơ Anăn Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei inh."
"but the word of the LORD came to me, saying, ‘You have shed much blood and have made great wars; you shall not build a house for My name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in My sight.","Mă-lei nơ̆r Kră Yang khan kơ inh: Ih pơlôch tuh pham lơ boih păng ih đei tơblah tih; ih ưh kơ gơh pơm hnam kơ Anăn Inh ôh, yua kơ ih pơlôch tuh pham lơ dêh 'bơ̆t anăp Inh lăm teh đak âu."
"Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies all around. His name shall be Solomon, for I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days.","Ih gô đei minh 'nu kon drŏ-nglo; sư gô jing minh 'nu bơngai drŏ-nglo hiôk rơnŭk, inh gô ăn kơ sư rơnŭk rơnua păng ăn pơdơh đơ̆ng đĭ-đăng ayăt tăp dăr kơ sư.

"He shall build a house for My name, and he shall be My son, and I will be his Father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.’","Sư boih gô pơm hnam kơ Anăn Inh.

"Now, my son, may the LORD be with you; and may you prosper, and build the house of the LORD your God, as He has said to you.","Dang ei ơ dăm ăn kơ Kră Yang oei hơdai hăm ih, tơgŭm ih lăm tơdrong pơm hnam kơkuh kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ih, kiơ̆ thoi Sư đei khan boih gah ih."
"Only may the LORD give you wisdom and understanding, and give you charge concerning Israel, that you may keep the law of the LORD your God.","Apinh Kră Yang ăn kơ ih tơdrong gơh hơgei hlôh wao wă kơ ih pơgơ̆r wei-lăng lu bơngai Isơrael wă kơ ih răk kiơ̆ tơdrong juăt Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ih."
"Then you will prosper, if you take care to fulfill the statutes and judgments with which the LORD charged Moses concerning Israel. Be strong and of good courage; do not fear nor be dismayed.","Thoi noh ih gô đei tơdrong kĕ jei, tơdah ih pơ'lơ̆ng wei răk pơm kiơ̆ tơdrong juăt păng nơ̆r tơtă Kră Yang athei Môis khan ăn kơ lu bơngai Isơrael.

"Indeed I have taken much trouble to prepare for the house of the LORD one hundred thousand talents of gold and one million talents of silver, and bronze and iron beyond measure, for it is so abundant. I have prepared timber and stone also, and you may add to them.","'Nâu inh gleh hrat chă wă kơ đei tơmam pơm Hnam Kră Yang, pêng-rơbâu puăn-hrĕng pơđăm-jĭt tân maih, pêng-jĭt puăn-rơbâu tân hu, kong hăm bơsei ưh kơ kĕ jô̆ ôh, inh kư̆m chă 'long lơ păng tơmo.

"David also commanded all the leaders of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying","Đawit khan pơkă kơ đĭ-đăng lu kră pơgơ̆r Isơrael athei tơgŭm kon drŏ-nglo sư Sôlômôn."
"“Is not the LORD your God with you? And has He not given you rest on every side?

"Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God. Therefore arise and build the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD and the holy articles of God into the house that is to be built for the name of the LORD.”","Dang ei đĭ jơhngơ̆m, đĭ bơhngol chơchă bĕ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu iĕm; iung bĕ păng pơm minh pôm anih 'lơ̆ng rơgoh kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei, lu iĕm tung ba bĕ Hom pơgơ̆p Kră Yang păng lu tơmam rơgoh 'lơ̆ng Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei tơmơ̆t lăm hnam mă lu iĕm pơm boih hăm Anăn Kră Yang.”"
"So when David was old and full of days, he made his son Solomon king over Israel.","Đawit đĭ kră, sơnăm sư đĭ sot bơih, na sư pơchĕp ăn kơ kon drŏ-nglo sư Sôlômôn pơm pơtao Isơrael."
"And he gathered together all the leaders of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.","Sư krao akŭm đĭ lu kră pơgơ̆r bơngai Isơrael, lu 'bok soi păng bơngai Lêwi."
"Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and above; and the number of individual males was thirty-eight thousand.","Bơngai Lêwi iŏk đơ̆ng pêng-jĭt sơnăm tơ kơpal, đe kư̆m jô̆ đĭ, đĭ-đăng đei pêng-jĭt tơhngam-rơbâu 'nu."

"There were more leaders found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar, and thus they were divided.

"These also cast lots just as their brothers the sons of Aaron did, in the presence of King David, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of the fathers’ houses of the priests and Levites.

"“All this,” said David, “the LORD made me understand in writing, by His hand upon me, all the works of these plans.”","Đawit pơma khan: “Đĭ-đăng lu 'nâu, inh đei đơ̆ng ti Kră Yang tơhlâu, păng ăn kơ inh hlôh băt đĭ-đăng rim tơdrong wă pơm.”"
"And David said to his son Solomon, “Be strong and of good courage, and do it; do not fear nor be dismayed, for the LORD God—my God—will be with you. He will not leave you nor forsake you, until you have finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD.","Đawit khan kơ Sôlômôn kon drŏ-nglo sư: “Mă pran kơjăp jơhngơ̆m đon na bơ̆jang; 'nĕ kơ hli, 'nĕ kơ bơ̆l hăl, yua kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei 'bă oei hơdai hăm kon; Sư ưh kơ đei layơ achăng hŭt kon, dĭng truh tơ tơiung hnam Kră Yang keh đang."
"Here are the divisions of the priests and the Levites for all the service of the house of God; and every willing craftsman will be with you for all manner of workmanship, for every kind of service; also the leaders and all the people will be completely at your command.”","Đei lu 'bok soi păng bơngai Lêwi, wă jang pơm hnam akŭm 'Bok Kei-Dei; đei lu sư gơh hơgei dôm tơdrong jang tơgŭm noh; lu 'bok pơgơ̆r păng đĭ-đăng kon pơlei, lu sư gô chu yom pơm kiơ̆ nơ̆r kon pơkă ngăl.”"
"Furthermore King David said to all the assembly: “My son Solomon, whom alone God has chosen, is young and inexperienced; and the work is great, because the temple is not for man but for the LORD God.","Đawit khan kơ đĭ-đăng tơpôl akŭm: “Sôlômôn, kon drŏ-nglo inh mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei đei rơih iŏk, oei hơ'lơ̆p, sư tam mă biơh băt tơdrong jang âu tih dêh, yua kơ pơm hnam ưh kơ trŏ pơm kơ bơngai ôh, mă-lei hnam 'noh pơm ăn kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei."
"Now for the house of my God I have prepared with all my might: gold for things to be made of gold, silver for things of silver, bronze for things of bronze, iron for things of iron, wood for things of wood, onyx stones, stones to be set, glistening stones of various colors, all kinds of precious stones, and marble slabs in abundance.","Inh đĭ jơhngơ̆m klơm klak hơmet tơmam wă pơm hnam Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei bơ̆n, maih kơ tơmam kiơ pơm hăm maih, hu kơ tơmam kiơ pơm hăm hu, kong kơ tơmam kiơ pơm hăm kong, bơsei kơ tơmam kiơ pơm hăm bơsei 'long kơ tơmam păng 'long tơmo rang păng lu tơmo gĭt hăm tơmo kok jơk tôm tĕch đak gôh găm."

"Then the leaders of the fathers’ houses, leaders of the tribes of Israel, the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the officers over the king’s work, offered willingly.","Thoi noh lu bơngai pơgơ̆r lăm adrĕch adrung, lu bơngai pơgơ̆r lăm adrĕch adrung Isơrael, lu yŏng pơgơ̆r minh-rơbâu linh păng minh-hrĕng linh, lu bơngai pơgơ̆r lăm tơdrong jang hnam pơtao lăp đon kơ pơyơ̆r."

"And whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of the LORD, into the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.","Bơngai bu đei tơmo gĭt, lei pơjao ăn kơ Jêhiêl adrĕch Gersôn, mă pơgơ̆r lăm hnam tah tơmam Kră Yang."
"Then the people rejoiced, for they had offered willingly, because with a loyal heart they had offered willingly to the LORD; and King David also rejoiced greatly.","Kon pơlei chơt hiôk gah tơdrong lu sư kơdih akâu đei pơyơ̆r, lu sư đĭ jơhngơ̆m pơyơ̆r kơ Kră Yang; păng pơtao Đawit kư̆m chơt hiôk dêh."
"Therefore David blessed the LORD before all the assembly; and David said: “Blessed are You, LORD God of Israel, our Father, forever and ever.","'Bơ̆t anăp đĭ-đăng tơpôl, Đawit bơnê kơ Kră Yang khan: Hơri bơnê kơ Ih ơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael 'bok lu nhôn, đơ̆ng dang ei truh tơ ning-mônh ưh kơ đei layơ tôch!"
"Yours, O LORD, is the greatness, The power and the glory, The victory and the majesty; For all that is in heaven and in earth is Yours; Yours is the kingdom, O LORD, And You are exalted as head over all.","Ơ Kră Yang Ih bơih, tih hloh mơsêh mơyang pran kơtang trŏ kơ hơri ư-ang, krưp rang mơnhal.

"Both riches and honor come from You, And You reign over all.

"“Now therefore, our God, We thank You And praise Your glorious name.","Dang ei, ơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu nhôn, lu nhôn bơnê kơ Ih păng hơri ư-ang anăn Ih."
"But who am I, and who are my people, That we should be able to offer so willingly as this? For all things come from You, And of Your own we have given You.","Mă-lei inh bu, păng kon pơlei inh kiơ, na mă gơh đei jơhngơ̆m pơyơ̆r thoi noh?

"For we are aliens and pilgrims before You, As were all our fathers; Our days on earth are as a shadow, And without hope.","Yua kơ 'bơ̆t anăp Ih lu nhôn păng lu yă 'bok nhôn jơ̆ bơngai tơmoi, chăl arih lu nhôn tơ kơpal teh nhen thoi ngôi ưh kơ đei anih wă hơmĕng."
"“O LORD our God, all this abundance that we have prepared to build You a house for Your holy name is from Your hand, and is all Your own.","Ơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu nhôn, dôm lu tơmam mă lu nhôn đei pơyơ̆r wă pơm hnam kơ Anăn 'Lơ̆ng Rơgoh Ih, tă kơ lĕch đơ̆ng ti Ih păng đĭ-đăng tă kơ tơmam ih ngăl."
"I know also, my God, that You test the heart and have pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things; and now with joy I have seen Your people, who are present here to offer willingly to You.","Ơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei inh, inh băt kơ Ih 'bôh nhen lăm jơhngơ̆m klơm klak kon bơngai păng Ih hiôk gah tơdrong 'lơ̆ng tơpăt.

"O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep this forever in the intent of the thoughts of the heart of Your people, and fix their heart toward You.","Ơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Abraham, Isăk păng Isơrael, yă 'bok lu nhôn apinh Ih ăn kơ kon pơlei ih wei răk ling-lang lăm Jơhngơ̆m đon 'lơ̆ng păng pơm ăn lăm Jơhngơ̆m lu sư chu kiơ̆ Ih."
"And give my son Solomon a loyal heart to keep Your commandments and Your testimonies and Your statutes, to do all these things, and to build the temple for which I have made provision.”","Apinh Ih ăn kơ Sôlômôn, kon drŏ-nglo inh, đĭ jơhngơ̆m wei răk lu nơ̆r tơtă khôi juăt păng nơ̆r Ih pơkă pơkăm kư̆m pơm tôm tơdrong jang wă, man tơiung hnam mă inh đei chă hơmet lê̆ tơmam bơih.”"
"Then David said to all the assembly, “Now bless the LORD your God.” So all the assembly blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed their heads and prostrated themselves before the LORD and the king.","Đawit khan kơ đĭ-đăng tơpôl: “Iĕm athei hơri bơnê kơkuh kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu iĕm.” Na đĭ-đăng khŭl tơpôl hơri bơnê hloi kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yă 'bok lu sư, lu sư kŭp kơ̆l drap kơkuh kơ Kră Yang, păng kơkuh kơ pơtao."
"And they made sacrifices to the LORD and offered burnt offerings to the LORD on the next day: a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.","Năr đơ̆ng rŏng, lu sư pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'buh ăn kơ Kră Yang.

"So they ate and drank before the LORD with great gladness on that day. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him before the LORD to be the leader, and Zadok to be priest.","lăm năr noh, lu sư sa et hiôk chơt 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang.

"Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.","Sôlômôn iung pơm pơtao Kră Yang pơtrơp kơ Đawit, 'bă Sư mơdrŏng tih; đĭ-đăng Isơrael chu kiơ̆ nơ̆r sư."
"All the leaders and the mighty men, and also all the sons of King David, submitted themselves to King Solomon.","Đĭ-đăng lu yŏng pơgơ̆r, păng lu bơngai nuih pran kơtang păng đĭ kơ lu kon drŏ-nglo pơtao Đawit pơkă wă chu yom pơm kiơ̆ pơtao Sôlômôn."
"So the LORD exalted Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed on him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.","Kră Yang pơm ăn kơ Sôlômôn đei pơyom 'bơ̆t anăp đĭ-đăng kon pơlei Isơrael; Sư ăn kơ dêh char Sôlômôn pơtao 'lơ̆ng rŏ hơbŏ krưp, ưh tam đei minh 'nu pơtao Isơrael ayơ adrol kơ sư mă đei thoi noh."
"Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.","Pơtao Đawit kon drŏ-nglo Jese, pơm pơtao pơgơ̆r đĭ-đăng lu bơngai Isơrael."
"And the period that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years he reigned in Hebron, and thirty-three years he reigned in Jerusalem.","Sư pơgơ̆r lu bơngai Isơrael lăm puăn-jĭt sơnăm, sư pơgơ̆r tơpơh sơnăm tơ Hêbrôn păng sư pơgơ̆r pêng-jĭt pêng sơnăm tơ Jêrusalem."
"So he died in a good old age, full of days and riches and honor; and Solomon his son reigned in his place.","Sư lôch, sơnăm sư đĭ kơjung, sư arih hrăp jơnap mơdrŏng tih păng đe pơyom. Sôlômôn, kon drŏ-nglo sư, pơtrơp sư pơm pơtao."
