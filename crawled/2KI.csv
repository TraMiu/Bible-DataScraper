"Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ Ahap lôch, lu bơngai Môap iung blah lu bơngai Isơrael."
"Now Ahaziah fell through the lattice of his upper room in Samaria, and was injured; so he sent messengers and said to them, “Go, inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover from this injury.”","Đei minh năr ei, tơ Pơlei Samari, Ahasia huŏng đơ̆ng 'măng-'mŏk hnam kơjung akâu sư rơka, jĭ dêh, na sư wơh bơngai jang kơ sư năm păng tơtă nơ̆r: “Năm jet apinh yang Baal Sêhup, yang Pơlei Ekrôn wă kơ băt inh gô klaih đơ̆ng jĭ 'nâu dah ưh?”"
"But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, “Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron?’","Mă-lei linh jang 'lơ̆ng Kră Yang khan kơ Êli bơngai Tisbit thoi âu: “Iung bĕ năm tơ'bơ̆p lu bơngai mă 'bok pơtao đe Samari wơh păng khan kơ lu sư: ‘Lăm Isơrael ưh kơ đei Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei hă na iĕm năm jet apinh yang Baal Sêhup, yang Pơlei Ekrôn noh?’"
"Now therefore, thus says the LORD: ‘You shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.’ ” So Elijah departed.","Yua kơ thoi noh, na Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei khan: ‘Ih ưh kơ đei iung đơ̆ng giơng ih 'bĭch noh ôh sĭt ih gô lôch.’ ” Thoi noh 'bok Êli yak năm hloi."
"And when the messengers returned to him, he said to them, “Why have you come back?”","Lu bơngai mă pơtao wơh noh wơ̆t brŏk tơ sư dơ̆ng, na pơtao jet lu sư: “Yua kơ kiơ iĕm wơ̆t brŏk?”"
"So they said to him, “A man came up to meet us, and said to us, ‘Go, return to the king who sent you, and say to him, “Thus says the LORD: ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.’ ” ’ ”","Lu sư tơl: “Đei minh 'nu bơngai tơ'bơ̆p nhôn păng khan kơ nhôn: ‘Iĕm brŏk bĕ tơ pơtao mă wơh iĕm 'noh păng iĕm roi kơ sư khan: Kră Yang khan bơih thoi âu: ‘Lăm lu bơngai Isơrael ưh kơ đei Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei hă na ih wơh athei năm jet yang Baal Sêhup, yang pơlei Ekrôn 'noh? Yua kơ noh, ih ưh kơ đei iung đơ̆ng giơng ih 'bĭch noh ôh, sĭt ih gô lôch?!”"
"Then he said to them, “What kind of man was it who came up to meet you and told you these words?”","Pơtao jet hloi lu sư: “Bơngai mă năm tơ'bơ̆p lu iĕm păng roi kơ iĕm tơdrong noh sư bơngai thoi yơ?”"
"So they answered him, “A hairy man wearing a leather belt around his waist.” And he said, “It is Elijah the Tishbite.”","Lu sư tơl: “Bơngai noh hrŭk ao akar sŏk sem bri păng tơ̆n tơlei tơ̆n akar.” Pơtao khan: “'Nei Êli bơngai Tisbit noh bơih.”"
"Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty men. So he went up to him; and there he was, sitting on the top of a hill. And he spoke to him: “Man of God, the king has said, ‘Come down!’ ”","Pơtao wơh hloi minh 'nu yŏng linh chông pơđăm-jĭt 'nu linh sư năm tơ Êli, kơplah noh Êli oei ngôi kơpal wĕch kông.

"So Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, “If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men.” And fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.","Mă-lei Êli tơl yŏng linh mă wei pơđăm-jĭt 'nu linh 'noh khan: “Dah inh bơngai Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua, apinh ŭnh đơ̆ng plĕnh jruh sa lê̆ ih hăm pơđăm-jĭt 'nu linh ih 'noh.” Na ŭnh đơ̆ng plĕnh jruh sa lê̆ yŏng linh ei păng pơđăm-jĭt 'nu linh sư hloi."
"Then he sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty men. And he answered and said to him: “Man of God, thus has the king said, ‘Come down quickly!’ ”","Pơtao wơh dơ̆ng yŏng linh nai hăm pơđăm-jĭt 'nu linh plơ̆ng năm tơ Êli, yŏng linh 'nâu khan kơ Êli: “Ơ bơngai mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua, pơtao khan kơ ih: ‘Jah jur mă tĕnh.’ ”"
"So Elijah answered and said to them, “If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men.” And the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.","Mă-lei Êli tơl yŏng linh ei: “Dah inh bơngai Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua, inh apinh ŭnh đơ̆ng plĕnh jruh sa lê̆ ih hăm pơđăm-jĭt 'nu linh ih noh hloi.

"Again, he sent a third captain of fifty with his fifty men. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and pleaded with him, and said to him: “Man of God, please let my life and the life of these fifty servants of yours be precious in your sight.","Pơtao Ahasia wơh dơ̆ng minh 'nu yŏng linh mă pêng năm hăm pơđăm-jĭt 'nu linh mă sư wei yŏng linh 'nâu tŏk truh tơ Êli tơ kơpal kông, sư sơtơ̆p kŭl-tăng 'bơ̆t anăp Êli, apinh thoi âu: “Nhôn đĭch đam ih ơ bơngai mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua, apinh ih lăng tơdrong arih inh păng tơdrong arih đĭ-đăng pơđăm-jĭt 'nu bơngai 'nâu gĭt găl."
"Look, fire has come down from heaven and burned up the first two captains of fifties with their fifties. But let my life now be precious in your sight.”","To ŭnh đơ̆ng plĕnh jruh chhông sa lê̆ 'bar 'nu yŏng linh păng 'bar khŭl linh bre sư bơih, mă-lei dang ei, apinh ih lăng tơdrong arih inh gĭt găl 'bơ̆t anăp ih.”"
"And the angel of the LORD said to Elijah, “Go down with him; do not be afraid of him.” So he arose and went down with him to the king.","Linh jang 'lơ̆ng Kră Yang khan kơ Êli: “Năm wăi ih jur năm tơ sư, 'nĕ kơ hli kiơ.” Thoi noh Êli jur năm kiơ̆ yŏng linh ei, năm tơ pơtao."
"Then he said to him, “Thus says the LORD: ‘Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of His word? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.’ ”","Sư khan kơ pơtao: “Kră Yang khan thoi âu: Ih wơh bơngai năm jet apinh yang Baal Sêhup, yang Pơlei Ekrôn, lăm Isơrael ưh kơ đei Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei mă ih wă jet apinh nơ̆r Sư bơih hă? Yua kơ noh bơih na ih ưh kơ đei iung đơ̆ng giơng ih 'bĭch noh ôh, sĭt ih gô lôch.”"
"So Ahaziah died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. Because he had no son, Jehoram became king in his place, in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah.","Thoi noh Ahasia lôch kiơ̆ thoi nơ̆r Kră Yang yua bơih Êli khan.

"Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?","Dôm lu tơdrong jang nai mă Ahasia đei pơm đe đei chih boih lăm sơ̆p hla bơar hơ'mon kơ chăl arih lu pơtao đe Isơrael."
"And it came to pass, when the LORD was about to take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.","Kră Yang wă pôk atŏk Êli hăm phŭt gơhnŏk huơ̆r, bre Êli păng Êlisê lĕch đơ̆ng Pơlei Gilgal."
"Then Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here, please, for the LORD has sent me on to Bethel.” But Elisha said, “As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you!” So they went down to Bethel.","Êli khan kơ Êlisê: “Inh apinh ih ngôi 'bơ̆t dâu; yua kơ Kră Yang wơh inh năm tơ Bethel.” Êlisê tơl sư: “Inh pơkă hăm Kră Yang mă arih ling-lang, păng pơkă hăm ih 'bok thây inh, inh ưh kơ layơ tơklah đơ̆ng ih ôh.” Thoi noh na bre sư năm hĭ tơ Bethel."
"Now the sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came out to Elisha, and said to him, “Do you know that the LORD will take away your master from over you today?” And he said, “Yes, I know; keep silent!”","Lu khŭl bơngai khan lê̆ adrol oei lăm pơlei Bethel năm jet Êlisê: “Ih hăm băt ưh dang ei Kră Yang wă pôk iŏk 'bok thây ih weh tơklah đơ̆ng ih? Sư tơl: “Inh băt; lu iĕm thĕng đĕch hŏ!"
"Then Elijah said to him, “Elisha, stay here, please, for the LORD has sent me on to Jericho.” But he said, “As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you!” So they came to Jericho.","Êli khan kơ Êlisê thoi âu: “Inh apinh ih ngôi 'bơ̆t dâu hŏ, yua kơ Kră Yang wơh inh năm tơ pơlei Jêrikô” Êlisê tơl dơ̆ng: “Inh pơkă hăm Kră Yang mă arih ling-lang păng pơkă hăm ih 'bok thây inh, inh ưh kơ layơ tơklah đơ̆ng ih ôh.” Thoi noh na bre sư năm hĭ tơ Pơlei Jêrikô."
"Now the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came to Elisha and said to him, “Do you know that the LORD will take away your master from over you today?” So he answered, “Yes, I know; keep silent!”","Lu khŭl bơngai khan lê̆ adrol oei lăm Pơlei Jêrikô năm tơ Êlisê, jet sư: “Ih hăm băt ưh năr âu Kră Yang wă pôk iŏk 'bok thây ih weh tơklah đơ̆ng ih? Sư tơl: “Inh băt; lu iĕm thĕng đĕch hŏ”"
"Then Elijah said to him, “Stay here, please, for the LORD has sent me on to the Jordan.” But he said, “As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you!” So the two of them went on.","Êli khan kơ sư: “Inh apinh ih ngôi 'bơ̆t dâu hŏ yua kơ Kră Yang wơh inh năm tơ đak krong Jôrđăn.” Êlisê tơl: “Inh pơkă hăm Kră Yang mă arih ling-lang păng pơkă hăm ih 'bok thây inh, inh ưh kơ layơ tơklah đơ̆ng ih ôh.” Thoi noh bre sư oei hơnơ̆ng năm hơdai đĕch."
"And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood facing them at a distance, while the two of them stood by the Jordan.","Đei pơđăm-jĭt 'nu lăm lu khŭl bơngai khan lê̆ adrol kiơ̆ bre sư, dơ̆ng tơ ataih kơ bre sư; bre Êli hăm Êlisê oei dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t cheng đak krong Jôrđăn."
"Now Elijah took his mantle, rolled it up, and struck the water; and it was divided this way and that, so that the two of them crossed over on dry ground.","Êli thar iŏk ao đaih sư, lôm huăt tơ đak krong, na đak krong tơklah 'bar na bre sư tŏk, nơnăm kơpal teh hrĕng."
"And so it was, when they had crossed over, that Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask! What may I do for you, before I am taken away from you?” Elisha said, “Please let a double portion of your spirit be upon me.”","Lăp bre sư tŏk hlôi bơih, Êli khan kơ Êlisê: “Roi kơ inh bĕ: Ih wă kơ inh pơm kơ ih tơdrong kiơ, adrol kơ Kră Yang pôk iŏk inh tŏk tơ plĕnh tơklah đơ̆ng ih” Êlisê tơl khan: “Ơ 'bok thây, apinh ăn kơ inh yang bơhngol đơ̆ng ih hơtŭt lăm inh thim 'bar wơ̆t kơ noh dơ̆ng.”"
"So he said, “You have asked a hard thing. Nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so for you; but if not, it shall not be so.”","Êli khan kơ sư: “Ih apinh minh tơdrong anat dêh, mă-lei dah ih 'bôh inh kơplah Kră Yang pôk iŏk inh tŏk tơ plĕnh tơklah đơ̆ng ih, lei sĭt gô đei thoi nơ̆r ih apinh; dah ưh lei nơ̆r ih apinh noh ưh kơ đei ôh.”"
"Then it happened, as they continued on and talked, that suddenly a chariot of fire appeared with horses of fire, and separated the two of them; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.","Kơplah bre sư oei nơnăm rah pơma dơnuh rah na 'bôh đei minh pôm gre aseh ŭnh păng aseh kư̆m ŭnh jur plah tơklah lê̆ bre sư; Êli phŭt gơhnŏk pôk ba sư tŏk tơ plĕnh."
"And Elisha saw it, and he cried out, “My father, my father, the chariot of Israel and its horsemen!” So he saw him no more. And he took hold of his own clothes and tore them into two pieces.","Êlisê lăng 'bôh na sư ôr hloi: “'Bă inh ơi, 'bă inh ơi!” Gre aseh păng linh Isơrael! Êlisê hnhoi dĭng khơ̆i ưh pă 'bôh Êli bơih; na sư hek ao sư phơ̆t tŏk-bŏk."
"He also took up the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan.","Êlisê dônh iŏk ao 'nguaih đêl huŏng đơ̆ng akâu Êli, na sư brŏk păng dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t jih đak krong Jôrđăn."
"Then he took the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and struck the water, and said, “Where is the LORD God of Elijah?” And when he also had struck the water, it was divided this way and that; and Elisha crossed over.","Sư iŏk ao 'nguaih đơ̆ng sư dônh 'noh sư huăt tơ đak păng khan: “Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Êli tơ yơ?” Lăp sư huăt tơ đak bơih đak tơklah 'bar pah, đơ̆ng noh Êlisê tŏk hĭ."
"Now when the sons of the prophets who were from Jericho saw him, they said, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” And they came to meet him, and bowed to the ground before him.","Kơplah lu khŭl bơngai khan lê̆ adrol oei lăm Pơlei Jêrikô, lu sư 'bôh Êlisê, na lu sư khan: “Yang Êli mơ̆t tơ Êlisê bơih.” Lu sư năm tơ'bơ̆p Êlisê păng drap bon 'bơ̆t anăp Êlisê."
"Then they said to him, “Look now, there are fifty strong men with your servants. Please let them go and search for your master, lest perhaps the Spirit of the LORD has taken him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley.” And he said, “You shall not send anyone.”","Păng khan kơ Êlisê: “Ơ 'bok thây, lăm lu đĭch đam ih âu đei pơđăm-jĭt 'nu bơngai nuih, apinh ih ăn lu sư năm chă yŏng tơ'ngla ih; băt jơ̆ Yang Bơhngol 'lơ̆ng Kră Yang anhăk ba sư klơ̆m hơtat lê̆ kơpal kông, dah klơ̆m hơtat lê̆ tơ thong ayơ bơih rŏ lăng?” Êlisê tơl: “'Nĕ kơ wơh lu sư năm.”"
"But when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, “Send them!” Therefore they sent fifty men, and they searched for three days but did not find him.","Mă-lei lu đe ei apinh pơgŏ 'bơ'bel dĭng sư mah mơlâu, na jing sư khan: “Lei wơh lu sư năm wăi” Na lu sư wơh hloi pơđăm-jĭt 'nu bơngai năm chă Êli lăm pêng năr, mă-lei lu sư chă, ưh kơ 'bôh ôh."
"And when they came back to him, for he had stayed in Jericho, he said to them, “Did I not say to you, ‘Do not go’?”","Lu sư wơ̆t brŏk tơ Êlisê, kơplah noh sư oei oei tơ Pơlei Jêrikô; na sư khan kơ lu đe ei: “Inh khan bơih kơ iĕm, athei iĕm 'nĕ kơ năm dah kiơ?”"
"Then the men of the city said to Elisha, “Please notice, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the ground barren.”","Kon pơlei Jêrikô khan kơ Êlisê: “Yŏng tơ'ngla inh, pơm pơlei 'bơ̆t anih 'nâu 'lơ̆ng dêh, thoi ih kư̆m 'bôh bơih, mă-lei đak đei hơkăm, păng teh pơtăm tơmam ưh kơ gơh.”"
"And he said, “Bring me a new bowl, and put salt in it.” So they brought it to him.","Êlisê tơl: “Ba ăn kơ inh pơnhan 'nao, tah 'boh lăm noh.” Lu đe ei ba ăn kơ Êlisê pơnhan 'boh noh."
"Then he went out to the source of the water, and cast in the salt there, and said, “Thus says the LORD: ‘I have healed this water; from it there shall be no more death or barrenness.’ ”","Na Êlisê năm truh tơ tu đak, sư tuh 'boh ei lăm tu đak noh, na khan: “Kră Yang khan thoi âu: ‘Inh pơklaih bơih đak 'nâu, đơ̆ng âu tơ anăp đak âu ưh pă pơm kơ kon bơngai lôch bơih, kư̆m huay pă pơm kơ nge lăm klak rơngăt dơ̆ng.’ ”"
"So the water remains healed to this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spoke.","Kiơ̆ thoi nơ̆r Êlisê đei pơma, đak noh jing 'lơ̆ng truh kơ dang ei."
"Then he went up from there to Bethel; and as he was going up the road, some youths came from the city and mocked him, and said to him, “Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!”","Êlisê weh đơ̆ng Pơlei Jêrikô noh, sư năm tơ Bethel.

"So he turned around and looked at them, and pronounced a curse on them in the name of the LORD. And two female bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the youths.","Êlisê hue lăng lu hơ'lơ̆p ei păng sư yua hăm anăn Kră Yang na hiap lu sư.

"Then he went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.","Đơ̆ng Bethel noh, Êlisê năm truh tơ kông Karmel; na đơ̆ng anih noh sư hơlơ̆k brŏk tơ Pơlei Samari."
"Now Jehoram the son of Ahab became king over Israel at Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.","Jôram sư kon drŏ-nglo Ahap, tŏk pơm pơtao char Isơrael tơ Pơlei Samari, lăm sơnăm mơjĭt-tơhngam, chăl Jêhôsaphat pơm pơtao char Juđa păng pơgơ̆r mơjĭt-'bar sơnăm."
"And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, but not like his father and mother; for he put away the sacred pillar of Baal that his father had made.","Sư pơm kơnê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, mă-lei sư ưh kơ lei-lăi thoi mĕ 'bă sư sơ̆ ôh, yua kơ sư hŭt lê̆ rup yang Baal đơ̆ng 'bă sư man pơdơ̆ng sơ̆."
"Nevertheless he persisted in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin; he did not depart from them.","Mă khan lei ră, sư kư̆m hưch hanh kiơ̆ tơdrong yoch Jêrôbôam, kon drŏ-nglo Nêbat, noh jơ̆ yoch mă hlôi pơm ăn kơ lu bơngai Isơrael pơm yoch. Sư ưh kơ chu achăng lê̆."
"Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheepbreeder, and he regularly paid the king of Israel one hundred thousand lambs and the wool of one hundred thousand rams.","Thoi noh Mêsa pơtao lu bơngai Môap, sư rong triu lơ, rim sơnăm sư ăn kơ pơtao Isơrael minh-hrĕng rơbâu tŏ triu kon păng minh-hrĕng rơbâu tŏ triu tơno đe ưh tam mă yuă sŏk sư."
"But it happened, when Ahab died, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.","Mă-lei, lăp Ahap lôch bơih, đei pơtao lu bơngai Môap iung blah pơtao đe Isơrael."
"So King Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time and mustered all Israel.","Thoi noh pơtao Jôram weh đơ̆ng Pơlei Samari, sư krao pơtơm đĭ-đăng lu bơngai Isơrael."
"Then he went and sent to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, saying, “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight against Moab?” And he said, “I will go up; I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.”","Sư wơh lu bơngai năm roi tơbăt ăn kơ Jêhôsaphat pơtao dêh Juđa khan: “Pơtao Môap tơblah hăm inh bơih, ih hăm gơh ưh ba năm blah lu bơngai Môap noh?

"Then he said, “Which way shall we go up?” And he answered, “By way of the Wilderness of Edom.”","Sư khan dơ̆ng: “Lei bơ̆n năm trong ayơ?” Jôram tơl: “Bơ̆n năm trong char glă Eđôm.”"
"So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom, and they marched on that roundabout route seven days; and there was no water for the army, nor for the animals that followed them.","Thoi noh, pơtao đe Isơrael, pơtao đe Juđa păng pơtao đe Eđôm wang năm đĭ-đăng, lu sư năm dăr trong char glă noh tơpơh năr kơ trong, na đak nhă ưh kơ đei wă ăn kơ lu khŭl linh păng khŭl sem dơrong kiơ̆ lu sư."
"And the king of Israel said, “Alas! For the LORD has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.”","Na pơtao đe Isơrael khan: “Kră Yang krao iŏk lu bơ̆n pêng 'nu pơtao 'nâu wă jao lê̆ lăm ti lu bơngai Môap bơih."
"But Jehoshaphat said, “Is there no prophet of the LORD here, that we may inquire of the LORD by him?” So one of the servants of the king of Israel answered and said, “Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.”","Mă-lei, Jêhôsaphat khan: “Tơ âu ưh kơ đei bơngai khan lê̆ adrol mă Kră Yang wă kơ bơ̆n gơnang kơ sư 'noh jet apinh Kră Yang tơgŭm bơ̆n hă?” Minh 'nu bơngai jang kơ pơtao đe Isơrael tơl thoi âu: “Tơ âu đei Êlisê, kon drŏ-nglo Saphat, bơngai mă đêl tuh đak ăn kơ Êli ôp ti.”"
"And Jehoshaphat said, “The word of the LORD is with him.” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.","Jêhôsaphat khan: “Nơ̆r Kră Yang pơma oei lăm sư.” Thoi noh, pơtao đe Isơrael, Jêhôsaphat, păng pơtao Eđôm jur năm hloi tơ Êlisê."
"Then Elisha said to the king of Israel, “What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father and the prophets of your mother.” But the king of Israel said to him, “No, for the LORD has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.”","Êlisê khan kơ pơtao Isơrael: “Ih hăm inh đei tơdrong kiơ?

"And Elisha said, “As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, surely were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I would not look at you, nor see you.","Na Êlisê khan: “Inh pơkă 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang tih hloh, Sư arih ling-lang Tơ'ngla mă inh bơ̆jang, tơdah inh ưh kơ chu yom kơ Jêhôsaphat, pơtao đe Juđa, inh ưh kơ wă lăng ih ôh, păng kư̆m ưh kơ wă sơng ih mơ̆n."
"But now bring me a musician.” Then it happened, when the musician played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.","Mă-lei dang ei, ba kơ inh minh 'nu bơngai gơh reh brŏ dung bĕ:” Kơplah bơngai ei oei reh brŏ dung na tơdrong mơsêh Kră Yang jur oei hơdai hăm Êlisê."
"And he said, “Thus says the LORD: ‘Make this valley full of ditches.’","Sư khan: “Kră Yang khan thoi âu: Sir hơlŭng mă lơ bĕ, sir jơ̆p kơ thŭng thong 'nâu”"
"For thus says the LORD: ‘You shall not see wind, nor shall you see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, so that you, your cattle, and your animals may drink.’","Yua kơ Kră Yang khan thoi âu: “Iĕm gô ưh kơ 'bôh kial, kư̆m ưh kơ 'bôh 'mi, mă-lei thŭng thong 'nâu gô 'bĕnh kơ đak na lu iĕm, khŭl rơmo triu iĕm, hăm aseh dôm sem dơrong iĕm, gô nhă đak 'noh."
"And this is a simple matter in the sight of the LORD; He will also deliver the Moabites into your hand.","Mă-lei Kră Yang lăng tơdrong noh iĕ đĕch. Sư gô jao hloi lu bơngai Môap lăm tơpang ti lu iĕm."
"Also you shall attack every fortified city and every choice city, and shall cut down every good tree, and stop up every spring of water, and ruin every good piece of land with stones.”","Gô jei iĕm pơrăm đĭ-đăng lu pơlei tih, kơđông kơjăp, lu pơlei tih rŏ kăl pơđĭ dôm lu 'long sa plei 'lơ̆ng, bơ̆ găn lê̆ lu tu đak păng iŏk tơmo hơtat pơrăm đĭ dôm lu chŭn teh 'lơ̆ng.”"
"Now it happened in the morning, when the grain offering was offered, that suddenly water came by way of Edom, and the land was filled with water.","Pơgê dơning, kơplah jơ đe pơyơ̆r tơmam soi, gip kơ đak ro đơ̆ng Eđôm truh tơ dêh ei đak 'bĕnh jơ̆p-jang."
"And when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, all who were able to bear arms and older were gathered; and they stood at the border.","Lăp lu bơngai Môap kơtơ̆ng băt lu pơtao noh năm wă blah lu sư, na lu sư krao akŭm pơpôi đĭ-đăng đơ̆ng 'lơ̆p truh tơ kră dôm lu bơngai mă gơh yua tơmam tơblah, năm dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t sơlam dêh char lu sư wă tơblah."
"Then they rose up early in the morning, and the sun was shining on the water; and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood.","Năr đơ̆ng rŏng, lu bơngai Môap iung đơ̆ng hrôih, 'năr pơchrang tơ đak, lu bơngai Môap 'bôh đak 'bơ̆t anăp lu sư 'breo thoi pham."
"And they said, “This is blood; the kings have surely struck swords and have killed one another; now therefore, Moab, to the spoil!”","Na lu sư ôr khan: “'Noh pham bơih, băt jơ̆ pêng 'nu pơtao tơblah tơ'bet băl tơduă bơih 'noh. Dang ei, ơ lu bơngai Môap, mơ̆t blah iŏk mŭk tơmam bĕ.”"
"So when they came to the camp of Israel, Israel rose up and attacked the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they entered their land, killing the Moabites.","Mă-lei lăp lu sư năm truh tơ anih linh Isơrael lu bơngai Isơrael iung blah lu bơngai Môap, lu bơngai Môap tơrơ, kơdâu 'bơ̆t anăp lu bơngai Isơrael.

"Then they destroyed the cities, and each man threw a stone on every good piece of land and filled it; and they stopped up all the springs of water and cut down all the good trees. But they left the stones of Kir Haraseth intact. However the slingers surrounded and attacked it.","Lu bơngai Isơrael blah pơrăm lơ lu pơlei tih, lu sư dônh tơmo hơtat 'bŭ lê̆ chŭn teh 'lơ̆ng, chĭt lê̆ dôm lu tu đak păng kăl pơđĭ dôm lu 'long 'lơ̆ng.

"And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew swords, to break through to the king of Edom, but they could not.","Pơtao lu bơngai Môap mơn kơdih sư tơblah pă kĕ bơih, na sư chông ba lu linh kiơ̆ sư tơpơh-hrĕng 'nu chĕp đao gưm wă pơih trong drŭt năm tơ pơtao Eđôm; mă-lei ưh kơ kĕ ôh."
"Then he took his eldest son who would have reigned in his place, and offered him as a burnt offering upon the wall; and there was great indignation against Israel. So they departed from him and returned to their own land.","Na sư iŏk kon tơdăm kơdră sư, bơngai mă wă pơgơ̆r pơtrơp đơ̆ng sư, pơyơ̆r sư pơm tơmam soi 'buh kơpal dur pơlei.

"A certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, saying, “Your servant my husband is dead, and you know that your servant feared the LORD. And the creditor is coming to take my two sons to be his slaves.”","Đei minh 'nu drŏ-kăn, sư 'noh akăn minh 'nu bơngai lăm lu bơngai khan lê̆ adrol năm nhơ̆m hơdrĭ 'bơ̆t anăp Êlisê: “Klo inh mă đĭch đam ih, sư lôch bơih; ih băt sư bơngai hli yom kơ Kră Yang.

"So Elisha said to her, “What shall I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?” And she said, “Your maidservant has nothing in the house but a jar of oil.”","Êlisê khan kơ duch ei: “Lei inh gơh tơgŭm ih kiơ?

"Then he said, “Go, borrow vessels from everywhere, from all your neighbors—empty vessels; do not gather just a few.","Êlisê khan kơ duch ei. “Ih chă mưng bô̆i hoh đơ̆ng bơngai anê̆ cham, ih 'nĕ kơ mưng tŏ sĕt hŏ!"
"And when you have come in, you shall shut the door behind you and your sons; then pour it into all those vessels, and set aside the full ones.”","Mưh ih brŏk kơnh, iĕm đe kon ih athei mơ̆t lăm hnam, tang lê̆ 'măng đơ̆ng noh tuh đak rơmă rim kơ bô̆i ei; mưh bô̆i ayơ 'bĕnh bơih, ming lê̆ sư pha hloi.”"
"So she went from him and shut the door behind her and her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured it out.","Duch ei chu hloi, sư đe kon sư mơ̆t lăm hnam tang chơkăl lê̆ 'măng; lu kon drŏ-nglo sư ba ăn kơ sư bô̆i. Na duch ei tuh đak rơmă rim kơ bô̆i ei."
"Now it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, “Bring me another vessel.” And he said to her, “There is not another vessel.” So the oil ceased.","Tuh 'bĕnh rim kơ bô̆i bơih, na khan kơ lu kon sư: “Ba ăn kơ inh minh pôm bô̆i plơ̆ng dơ̆ng.” Kon sư tơl khan: “Bô̆i pă đei 'nhŏ kơ minh pôm hloi bơih.” Na đak rơmă ôliwơ ei nhĕt pă đei ro dơ̆ng."
"Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, “Go, sell the oil and pay your debt; and you and your sons live on the rest.”","Kơplah ei, duch noh roi ăn kơ Êlisê bơngai mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua, na Êlisê khan kơ lu sư. “Ih tĕch bĕ đak rơmă ôliwơ na pơdrâu ăn tôm hĭ đêl iĕm hre đom ei, na oei rơkah noh ih iŏk yua 'me rong hnam dơnŏ ih.”"
"Now it happened one day that Elisha went to Shunem, where there was a notable woman, and she persuaded him to eat some food. So it was, as often as he passed by, he would turn in there to eat some food.","Minh năr ei, Êlisê Năm brih rok Pơlei Sunem, tơ ei đei minh 'nu yă mơdrŏng gơ̆t hĭ sư sŏng sa.

"And she said to her husband, “Look now, I know that this is a holy man of God, who passes by us regularly.","Yă ei khan kơ klo sư: “Inh băt bơngai mă juăt kơ năm tơ hnam bơ̆n 'noh sư bơngai 'lơ̆ng tơpăt thoi Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei wă."
"Please, let us make a small upper room on the wall; and let us put a bed for him there, and a table and a chair and a lampstand; so it will be, whenever he comes to us, he can turn in there.”","Bĕ ba pơm ăn kơ sư minh anih tơ kơpal pĕng đei tơnăr, tah lăm noh minh pôm giơng tep, minh pôm gơ'bang; minh pôm tang-dŏ hơ-oei, păng minh pôm ŭnh kơđeng.

"And it happened one day that he came there, and he turned in to the upper room and lay down there.","Minh năr ei, Êlisê năm truh tơ noh sư 'bĭch pơdơh 'bơ̆t anih kơpal ei, tep hloi tơ noh."
"Then he said to Gehazi his servant, “Call this Shunammite woman.” When he had called her, she stood before him.","Sư khan kơ Gêhasi bơngai đam sư: “Krao bĕ bơngai drŏ-kăn Pơlei Sunem noh” Gêhasi krao duch ei na duch ei năm hĭ, dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp Êlisê."
"And he said to him, “Say now to her, ‘Look, you have been concerned for us with all this care. What can I do for you? Do you want me to speak on your behalf to the king or to the commander of the army?’ ” She answered, “I dwell among my own people.”","Êlisê khan kơ đam sư: “Ih khan kơ duch 'noh: Ih hiơ̆k hơmet ăn kơ nhi dôm tơmam 'nâu bơih na nhi pơm kiơ wă tơgŭm ih?

"So he said, “What then is to be done for her?” And Gehazi answered, “Actually, she has no son, and her husband is old.”","Êlisê khan dơ̆ng kơ Gêhasi đam sư: “Lei ba wă tơgŭm lu sư kiơ?” Gêhasi tơl: “Duch âu sư ưh kơ đei kon drŏ-nglo ôh, na klo sư kư̆m đĭ kră bơih tăm.”"
"So he said, “Call her.” When he had called her, she stood in the doorway.","Êlisê khan: “Krao sư tơ âu:” Gêhasi krao duch ei, duch ei năm dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t 'măng."
"Then he said, “About this time next year you shall embrace a son.” And she said, “No, my lord. Man of God, do not lie to your maidservant!”","Êlisê khan kơ duch ei: “Sơnăm anăp, kơplah bơyan 'nâu mơ̆n ih gô pôk minh 'nu hơ'lơ̆p drŏ-nglo.” Duch ei tơl: “Ưh, ơ yŏng tơ'ngla inh, bơngai mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua, ih 'nĕ kơ pơma hơlĕnh pơ'brơh kơ inh đam drŏ-kăn ih.”"
"But the woman conceived, and bore a son when the appointed time had come, of which Elisha had told her.","Duch ei anăp na truh minh sơnăm đơ̆ng rŏng, kư̆m kơplah bơyan 'nei mơ̆n, sư hơiơch hĭ kơ minh 'nu kon drŏ-nglo, 'blep thoi nơ̆r Êlisê khan lê̆ kơ sư adrol."
"And the child grew. Now it happened one day that he went out to his father, to the reapers.","Truh tơ kon hơ'lơ̆p sư wơ̆ 'lŏ bơih, đei minh năr ei, sư năm tơ 'bă sư oei yuă 'ba hơdai hăm lu bôl buăl."

"And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, shut the door upon him, and went out.","Duch ei năm tơ'bĭch sư 'bơ̆t giơng bơngai mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua ei đơ̆ng noh sư lĕch, tang chơkăl lê̆ 'măng."
"Then she called to her husband, and said, “Please send me one of the young men and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God and come back.”","Đơ̆ng noh, duch ei krao klo sư, khan: “Inh apinh ih krao minh 'nu đam ba tơ âu păng iŏk minh pôm aseh lê̆ inh kơdâu krao Êlisê bơngai mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua, đang kơ krao sư, inh brŏk hloi tơ âu.”"
"So he said, “Why are you going to him today? It is neither the New Moon nor the Sabbath.” And she said, “It is well.”","Klo duch ei jet: “Năr 'nâu ưh kơ trŏ năr khei plơ̆ng ôh, kư̆m ưh kơ trŏ năr pơdơh Sa'bat mơ̆n. Thoi noh yua kơ kiơ wă năm tơ sư?” Duch ei tơl: “Huay ôh”"
"Then she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, “Drive, and go forward; do not slacken the pace for me unless I tell you.”","Duch ei athei đam sư hao aseh păng khan kơ đam sư: “Ih jah ba inh mă tĕnh tĕnh, dĭng mưh inh athei dơ̆ng lei ih dơ̆ng.”"
"And so she departed, and went to the man of God at Mount Carmel. So it was, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to his servant Gehazi, “Look, the Shunammite woman!","Thoi noh, duch ei năm truh tơ Êlisê bơngai mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua, tơ kông Karmel.

"Please run now to meet her, and say to her, ‘Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child?’ ” And she answered, “It is well.”","Ih kơdâu sơng sư năm!

"Now when she came to the man of God at the hill, she caught him by the feet, but Gehazi came near to push her away. But the man of God said, “Let her alone; for her soul is in deep distress, and the LORD has hidden it from me, and has not told me.”","Duch ei tŏk tơ kơpal kông tơkan năm jê̆ na kuăr jơ̆ng Êlisê bơngai mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua.

"So she said, “Did I ask a son of my lord? Did I not say, ‘Do not deceive me’?”","Na duch ei khan: “Inh ưh kơ pơ̆n 'mơ̆i wă apinh đei kon drŏ-nglo, ih hăm 'blŏk, inh khan kơ ih 'nĕ kơ chă hơlĕnh kơ inh?”"
"Then he said to Gehazi, “Get yourself ready, and take my staff in your hand, and be on your way. If you meet anyone, do not greet him; and if anyone greets you, do not answer him; but lay my staff on the face of the child.”","Êlisê khan kơ Gêhasi: “Iŏk tơlei tơ̆n, tơ̆n tơ kơiĕng ih, chĕp ba 'long jra inh 'nâu păng năm hloi dang ei, dah ih tơ'bơ̆p bu ih 'nĕ kơ pơma dơnuh, dah bu bu pơma dơnuh hăm ih, ih 'nĕ kơ tơl hŏ!

"And the mother of the child said, “As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” So he arose and followed her.","Mĕ bơngai 'lơ̆p ei khan: “Inh pơkă hăm Kră Yang mă arih ling-lang păng pơkă hăm ih, inh ưh kơ layơ tơklah đơ̆ng ih.” Na Êlisê gruih iung, kiơ̆ duch ei hloi."
"Now Gehazi went on ahead of them, and laid the staff on the face of the child; but there was neither voice nor hearing. Therefore he went back to meet him, and told him, saying, “The child has not awakened.”","Gêhasi năm adrol kơ bre sư păng dan 'long jra 'bơ̆t muh măt bơngai 'lơ̆p ei.

"And he went up and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands; and he stretched himself out on the child, and the flesh of the child became warm.","Đang kơ krao khan, sư tŏk tơ kơpal giơng, 'bĭch brom kơpal 'lơ̆p ei, 'bơ̆r sư tơ'bưh 'bơ̆t 'bơ̆r 'lơ̆p ei, măt sư tơ'bưh 'bơ̆t măt 'lơ̆p ei ti sư tơ'bưh 'bơ̆t ti 'lơ̆p ei mơ̆n, sư 'bĭch brom kơpal bơngai lôch ei, akâu 'lơ̆p ei tơtŏ hloi."
"He returned and walked back and forth in the house, and again went up and stretched himself out on him; then the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.","Êlisê jur, nơnăm 'ma 'ngiĕo lăm anih ei, đơ̆ng noh hơlơ̆k tŏk kơpal giơng lăm ei dơ̆ng tuch-luch sư, 'lơ̆p ei kơseh tơpơh 'măng păng măt sư lar hloi."
"And he called Gehazi and said, “Call this Shunammite woman.” So he called her. And when she came in to him, he said, “Pick up your son.”","Na Êlisê krao hloi Gêhasi, na khan: “Ih krao bơngai drŏ-kăn Pơlei Sunem noh tơ âu.” Gêhasi krao hĭ duch ei.

"So she went in, fell at his feet, and bowed to the ground; then she picked up her son and went out.","Duch ei năm truh, drap 'bơ̆t jơ̆ng sư, păng kŭp muh măt tơ teh, pôk iŏk kon sư na lĕch tơ 'nguaih."
"And Elisha returned to Gilgal, and there was a famine in the land. Now the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said to his servant, “Put on the large pot, and boil stew for the sons of the prophets.”","Êlisê wih tơ Gilgal.

"So one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered from it a lapful of wild gourds, and came and sliced them into the pot of stew, though they did not know what they were.","Minh 'nu lăm lu sư, lĕch năm tơ mir chă phĕ 'nhot, 'bôh plei hơmu bri, na sư phĕ hĭ hơmu bri ei, 'nŭng 'bơ̆t kiĕng ao sư, brŏk tơ hnam, kiĕt blah, tah lăm gŏ, kơplah ei oei ưh kơ băt noh plei kiơ."
"Then they served it to the men to eat.

"So he said, “Then bring some flour.” And he put it into the pot, and said, “Serve it to the people, that they may eat.” And there was nothing harmful in the pot.","Êlisê khan: “Lei ăn tơpŭng noh tơ âu.” Na sư iŏk tơpŭng ei tuh lăm gŏ păng athei đe noh: “Sŏ ăn kơ lu sư sa bĕ.” Thoi noh, lăm gŏ 'nhot ei pă đei hơkăm kiơ bơih."
"Then a man came from Baal Shalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley bread, and newly ripened grain in his knapsack. And he said, “Give it to the people, that they may eat.”","Đei minh 'nu bơngai đơ̆ng Baal Salisa truh, ba ăn kơ Êlisê bơngai 'Bok Kei-Dei yua noh 'bar-jĭt tŏ 'bĕng mi păng minh hnŏng ba bơyan yuă blŭng-a.

"But his servant said, “What?

"So he set it before them; and they ate and had some left over, according to the word of the LORD.","Thoi noh, Gêhasi chu nơ̆r Êlisê, iŏk 'bĕng ei dan 'bơ̆t anăp lu sư lu sư sa phĭ, đơ̆ng noh oei rơkah 'blep thoi nơ̆r Kră Yang đei khan bơih."
"Now Naaman, commander of the army of the king of Syria, was a great and honorable man in the eyes of his master, because by him the LORD had given victory to Syria.

"And it happened, when the king of Israel read the letter, that he tore his clothes and said, “Am I God, to kill and make alive, that this man sends a man to me to heal him of his leprosy?

"So it was, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, “Why have you torn your clothes? Please let him come to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.”","Êlisê kơtơ̆ng băt pơtao đe Isơrael hek ao sư kơdih, sư wơh bơngai năm khan kơ pơtao đe Isơrael: “Yua kơ kiơ ih hek lê̆ ao ih kơdih?

"Then Naaman went with his horses and chariot, and he stood at the door of Elisha’s house.","Thoi noh, Naaman hao gre aseh năm tơ noh, dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t 'măng hnam Êlisê."
"And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, “Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be restored to you, and you shall be clean.”","Êlisê wơh bơngai jang kơ sư khan kơ Naaman thoi âu: “Năm tơ đak krong Jôrđăn môch hum akâu ih tơpơh wơ̆t, lei rơka jĭ chin ih dih gô klaih rơgoh đĭ.”"
"But Naaman became furious, and went away and said, “Indeed, I said to myself, ‘He will surely come out to me, and stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, and wave his hand over the place, and heal the leprosy.’","Mă-lei Naaman hil, sư năm rah jŏk rah: “Inh tơchĕng hli kơ akâu sư kơdih hloi năm sơng inh, dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t ei krao apinh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei, iŏk ti sư pel hloi 'bơ̆t rơka jĭ chin, hơli 'ma 'ngiĕo, pơklaih jĭ chin inh."
"Are not the Abanah and the Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean?” So he turned and went away in a rage.","Đak krong Abana păng đak krong Pharpar, 'bar tŏ đak krong tơ Đamas 'noh ưh kơ 'lơ̆ng hloh kơ lu đak krong tơ Isơrael hă?

"And his servants came near and spoke to him, and said, “My father, if the prophet had told you to do something great, would you not have done it? How much more then, when he says to you, ‘Wash, and be clean’?”","Mă-lei lu đĭch đam sư năm jê̆ sư, khan kơ sư: “Ơ 'bă, dah bơngai khan lê̆ adrol athei ih pơm tơdrong tơnat ih ưh kơ pơm hă?

"So he went down and dipped seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.","Na Naaman jur hĭ lăm đak krong Jôrđăn păng môch tơpơh wơ̆t kiơ̆ thoi Êlisê bơngai mă 'Bok Kei-Dei yua noh athei sư.

"And he returned to the man of God, he and all his aides, and came and stood before him; and he said, “Indeed, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, except in Israel; now therefore, please take a gift from your servant.”","Naaman hăm đĭ-đăng bơngai mă kiơ̆ sư wơ̆t dơ̆ng tơ Êlisê păng khan thoi âu: “Dang ei inh băt bơih, jơ̆p-jang lăm teh đak ưh kơ đei yang nai hloh kơ Kră Yang 'Bok kei-Dei lu bơngai Isơrael, thoi noh apinh ih iŏk tơmam inh bơngai mă đĭch đam ih 'nâu.”"
"But he said, “As the LORD lives, before whom I stand, I will receive nothing.” And he urged him to take it, but he refused.","Mă-lei Êlisê tơl khan: “Inh pơkă hăm Anăn Kră Yang mă arih ling-lang, tơ'ngla mă inh bơ̆jang, inh ưh kơ iŏk yă kiơ ôh.” Naaman lung athei Êlisê iŏk, mă-lei Êlisê pơjăng ưh kơ iŏk."
"So Naaman said, “Then, if not, please let your servant be given two mule-loads of earth; for your servant will no longer offer either burnt offering or sacrifice to other gods, but to the LORD.","Naaman khan dơ̆ng: “Tơdah ih ưh kơ iŏk kiơ inh apinh ih asong inh kôch iŏk hơya 'bar bai teh lăp kơ 'bar tŏ aseh iĕ chơ kĕ; yua kơ đơ̆ng âu tơ anăp inh bơngai mă đĭch đam ih, ưh pă pơyơ̆r kơ yang nai ôh dôm tơmam soi 'buh pơkhôi dah tơmam soi nai 'nguaih kơ Kră Yang."
"Yet in this thing may the LORD pardon your servant: when my master goes into the temple of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow down in the temple of Rimmon—when I bow down in the temple of Rimmon, may the LORD please pardon your servant in this thing.”","Apinh Kră Yang mơnat pă jô̆ yo kơ inh minh tơdrong 'nâu đĕch: Rim wơ̆t yŏng tơ'ngla inh, mơ̆t lăm hnam yang Rimôn wă kơkuh kơ yang ei, dui ba kơkŏng ti inh, na mưh sư kơkuh, inh kư̆m drap kơkuh thoi sư mơ̆n.

"Then he said to him, “Go in peace.” So he departed from him a short distance.","Êlisê khan: Năm bĕ, yak kơ ih mă 'lơ̆ng rŏ, hiôk-hian! Lăp Naaman hlôi weh đơ̆ng Êlisê, ataih 'biơ̆ bơih."
"But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, “Look, my master has spared Naaman this Syrian, while not receiving from his hands what he brought; but as the LORD lives, I will run after him and take something from him.”","Na Gêhasi đam Êlisê, bơngai mă 'Bok Kei-Dei yua, sư pơma lăm to khan: “To, tơ'ngla inh mơnat ăn huay kơ jô̆ yo Naaman, bơngai Aram, sư ưh kơ iŏk tơmam kiơ đơ̆ng Naaman ăn kơ sư, Inh pơkă 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang mă arih ling-lang, Inh gô druh 'moi Naaman, păng khŏm iŏk tơmam kiơ kiơ đơ̆ng sư 'mơ̆i.”"
"So Gehazi pursued Naaman. When Naaman saw him running after him, he got down from the chariot to meet him, and said, “Is all well?”","Thoi noh, Gêhasi druh 'moi Naaman!

"And he said, “All is well. My master has sent me, saying, ‘Indeed, just now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the mountains of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of garments.’ ”","Gêhasi tơl: “Tôm tơdrong oei hiôk-hian mơ̆n, yŏng tơ'ngla inh athei roi kơ ih.

"So Naaman said, “Please, take two talents.” And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and handed them to two of his servants; and they carried them on ahead of him.","Naaman khan: “He bĕ, iŏk 'bar talâng hu 'nâu,” sư pơlŭt athei Gêhasi iŏk 'bar hlak jên hu, păng 'bar blah ao tah lăm 'bar tŏ kơdŭng 'bi ăn kơ bre đam sư athei ăn kơ Gêhasi."
"When he came to the citadel, he took them from their hand, and stored them away in the house; then he let the men go, and they departed.","Lăp truh 'bơ̆t jơ̆ng kông bơih, Gêhasi iŏk 'bar tŏ 'bi đơ̆ng ti bre đam Naaman, tah lê̆ lăm hnam sư kơdih, na lê̆ bre ei brŏk."
"Now he went in and stood before his master. Elisha said to him, “Where did you go, Gehazi?” And he said, “Your servant did not go anywhere.”","Na sư hăt hot năm hloi tơ Êlisê yŏng tơ'ngla sư, Êlisê jet sư khan; “ơ Gêhasi ih brŏk đơ̆ng yơ noh hei?” Sư tơl: “Inh ưh kơ đei năm tơ yơ ôh”"
"Then he said to him, “Did not my heart go with you when the man turned back from his chariot to meet you? Is it time to receive money and to receive clothing, olive groves and vineyards, sheep and oxen, male and female servants?","Mă-lei, Êlisê khan dơ̆ng: “'Bơ̆t bơngai 'noh jur đơ̆ng gre aseh năm tơkan sơng ih hei, bơhngol inh ưh kơ oei hăm ih tơ noh hă?

"Therefore the leprosy of Naaman shall cling to you and your descendants forever.” And he went out from his presence leprous, as white as snow.","Yua kơ thoi noh bơih, jĭ chin Naaman gô hơpoh tơ ih păng adrĕch adrung ih ling-lang ưh kơ layơ tôch.” Gêhasi weh hloi đơ̆ng Êlisê, 'bơm hloi chin tơbôk thoi prĕl."
"And the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, “See now, the place where we dwell with you is too small for us.","Lu bơngai khan lê̆ adrol khan kơ Êlisê thoi âu: “Lăng deh hnam lu nhôn âu oei iĕ hrăt-hrot dêh kơ lu nhôn."
"Please, let us go to the Jordan, and let every man take a beam from there, and let us make there a place where we may dwell.” So he answered, “Go.”","Apinh ih ăn kơ lu nhôn năm tơ đak krong Jôrđăn đĭ-đăng nhôn wang kăl 'long na pơm hnam lu nhôn oei 'bơ̆t tơter đak krong noh.” Êlisê tơl: “Năm wăi!”"

"So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down trees.","Thoi noh sư năm hĭ hăm lu đĭch đam sư. Truh tơ krong Jôrđăn, lu sư 'nao pơtơm wă kăl 'long."
"But as one was cutting down a tree, the iron ax head fell into the water; and he cried out and said, “Alas, master! For it was borrowed.”","Mă-lei đei minh 'nu tŏk-bŏk sư oei kăl 'long, pla sung sư tơgloh, huŏng lăm đak; sư ôr: “Ơ yŏng tơ'ngla inh! Ôi sung 'nâu inh mưng sung đe tăm dơ̆ng.”"
"So the man of God said, “Where did it fall?” And he showed him the place. So he cut off a stick, and threw it in there; and he made the iron float.","Êlisê bơngai 'Bok Kei-Dei yua jet: “Sung huŏng tơklă ayơ?” Bơngai ei tơhlâu ăn anih sư huŏng Êlisê koh minh hơjăl 'long, hrang tơklă pla sung huŏng noh, pơm kơ pla sung trơl đông kơpal đak"
"Therefore he said, “Pick it up for yourself.” So he reached out his hand and took it.","păng athei: “Iŏk sung ih wăi!” Na bơngai noh 'mơn iŏk pla sung 'noh hloi."
"Now the king of Syria was making war against Israel; and he consulted with his servants, saying, “My camp will be in such and such a place.”","Thoi noh pơtao đe Aram tơblah hăm lu bơngai Isơrael. Pơtao hăm lu yŏng linh, lu đĭch đam sư pơđâu băl: “Inh gô pơm kơđông inh tơ anih âu, anih to.”"
"And the man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, “Beware that you do not pass this place, for the Syrians are coming down there.”","Êlisê bơngai Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua, năm roi ăn kơ pơtao đe Isơrael thoi âu: “Kơchăng hŏ 'nĕ kơ năm rok anih noh, đei lu linh đe Aram oei răp tơ noh.”"
"Then the king of Israel sent someone to the place of which the man of God had told him. Thus he warned him, and he was watchful there, not just once or twice.","Thoi noh pơtao đe Isơrael wơh bơngai năm truh tơ anih mă Êlisê bơngai Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua đei tơbăt păng roi kơ sư adrol bơih; khan athei sư krăng kơchăng lơ wơ̆t thoi noh, sư kơchăng ling-lang."
"Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was greatly troubled by this thing; and he called his servants and said to them, “Will you not show me which of us is for the king of Israel?”","Jơhngơ̆m pơtao đe Aram rŭng răng kơ tơdrong noh, na krao lu đĭch đam sư păng khan: Liơ iĕm ưh kơ roi ăn kơ inh, bơngai bu mơ̆t pơtao đe Isơrael?"
"And one of his servants said, “None, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom.”","Minh 'nu lăm đĭch đam sư tơl: “Ơ pơtao, yŏng tơ'ngla inh, lăm lu nhôn ưh kơ đei bu mơ̆t pơtao đe Isơrael ôh; Êlisê to, sư 'bok khan lê̆ adrol mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua lăm lu đe Isơrael, sư tơbăt ăn kơ pơtao đe Isơrael dôm nơ̆r ih pơma hơdrô̆ lăm anih tep ih.”"
"So he said, “Go and see where he is, that I may send and get him.” And it was told him, saying, “Surely he is in Dothan.”","Pơtao athei: “Năm bĕ iĕm chă sư wă kơ băt sư oei tơ yơ, na lê̆ inh ăn linh năm rôp sư.” Đei bơngai năm roi hĭ kơ pơtao. “To sư oei tơ Pơlei Dôthan.”"
"Therefore he sent horses and chariots and a great army there, and they came by night and surrounded the city.","Thoi noh, na pơtao athei linh sư lơ, hao aseh, păng hao gre aseh năm tơ Pơlei Đôthan, lu sư truh tơ ei kơmăng na wang tăp kơ pơlei ei."
"And when the servant of the man of God arose early and went out, there was an army, surrounding the city with horses and chariots. And his servant said to him, “Alas, my master! What shall we do?”","Truh tơ pơgê, đĭch đam, Êlisê bơngai mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua, iung đơ̆ng hrôih, lĕch tơ jih 'bôh khŭl linh lơ, hăm aseh, gre aseh hloi, oei wang tăp kơ pơlei ei.

"So he answered, “Do not fear, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.”","Êlisê khan: “'Nĕ kơ hli đei lu bơngai oei hăm bơ̆n lơ hloh kơ bơngai oei hăm lu sư.”"
"And Elisha prayed, and said, “LORD, I pray, open his eyes that he may see.” Then the LORD opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw. And behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.","Đơ̆ng noh, Êlisê krao khan thoi âu: “Ơ Kră Yang apinh ih pơih ăn măt đĭch đam inh wă kơ sư gơh 'bôh.” Kră Yang pơih ăn măt đam noh, na sư 'bôh rơwơ̆nh rơwănh kơ aseh 'bĕnh kơ kông păng gre aseh ŭnh tăp tang kơ Êlisê."
"So when the Syrians came down to him, Elisha prayed to the LORD, and said, “Strike this people, I pray, with blindness.” And He struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.","Linh đe Aram jur wă pơm kơ Êlisê na sư krao khan kơ Kră Yang thoi âu: “Apinh ih pơm kơ măt lu linh ayăt 'nâu bơbôl ưh kơ bang.” Thoi noh Kră Yang pơm hloi kơ măt lu linh ei bơbôl ưh kơ bang, kiơ̆ thoi nơ̆r Êlisê krao khan."
"Now Elisha said to them, “This is not the way, nor is this the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek.” But he led them to Samaria.","Êlisê khan kơ lu sư: “'Nâu ưh kơ trŏ kơ trong kư̆m ưh kơ trŏ kơ pơlei ôh.

"So it was, when they had come to Samaria, that Elisha said, “LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see.” And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and there they were, inside Samaria!","Lăp lu sư mơ̆t hlom lăm pơlei Samari bơih, Êlisê krao khan: “Ơ Kră Yang, apinh ih pơih măt lu sư ăn kơ lu sư hơdah.” Kră Yang pơih hloi măt lu sư, ăn kơ lu sư hơdah na lu sư 'bôh lu sư oei tŏk-bŏk Pơlei Samari."
"Now when the king of Israel saw them, he said to Elisha, “My father, shall I kill them? Shall I kill them?”","Pơtao đe Isơrael 'bôh lu sư, na pơma dơnuh hăm Êlisê khan: “Ơ 'bă wă pơlôch lu sư dah ưh? Wă pơlôch lu sư dah ưh?”"
"But he answered, “You shall not kill them. Would you kill those whom you have taken captive with your sword and your bow? Set food and water before them, that they may eat and drink and go to their master.”","Êlisê khan: “'Nĕ kơ pơlôch!

"Then he prepared a great feast for them; and after they ate and drank, he sent them away and they went to their master. So the bands of Syrian raiders came no more into the land of Israel.","Na sư hơmet ăn kơ lu đe noh et sa tih; lăp lu sư et sa đang bơih, sư achăng lu đe ei brŏk, na lu sư brŏk tơ yŏng lu sư.

"And it happened after this that Ben-Hadad king of Syria gathered all his army, and went up and besieged Samaria.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ lu tơdrong noh, Ben Hadat, pơtao đe Aram, pơpôi akŭm đĭ-đăng lu linh sư năm wang pơlei Samari."
"And there was a great famine in Samaria; and indeed they besieged it until a donkey’s head was sold for eighty shekels of silver, and one-fourth of a kab of dove droppings for five shekels of silver.","Lăm Pơlei Samari hơtai đei pơngot tih, kơplah đe wang pơlei noh đunh, dĭng mah minh pôm kơ̆l aseh iĕ đe tĕch truh tơhngam-jĭt hlak jên hu, ĭch kơtơp dang minh puăt getchai lit, kư̆m tĕch pơđăm hlak jên hu."
"Then, as the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried out to him, saying, “Help, my lord, O king!”","Kơplah pơtao đe Isơrael nơnăm chă dăr rok kơpal dur pơlei, đei minh 'nu drŏ-kăn krao sư ôr khan: “Ô yŏng tơ'ngla inh, pơtao inh, inh apinh ih dŏng inh.”"
"And he said, “If the LORD does not help you, where can I find help for you? From the threshing floor or from the winepress?”","Pơtao khan: “Dah Kră Yang ưh kơ dŏng ih, lei inh wă dŏng ih hăm kiơ? Yua kơ ưh pă đei kiơ lăm anih preh 'ba, kư̆m ưh pă đei kiơ lăm anih hmĕt đak hơmu bơih.”"
"Then the king said to her, “What is troubling you?” And she answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give your son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.’","Pơtao jet: “Ih đei tơdrong kiơ?” Duch ei tơl: “Bơngai drŏ-kăn âu khan kơ inh: Ăn kon drŏ-nglo ih, bơ̆n pơm 'nhĕm sa năr 'nâu na dơning sa kon drŏ-nglo inh."
"So we boiled my son, and ate him. And I said to her on the next day, ‘Give your son, that we may eat him’; but she has hidden her son.”","Thoi noh, nhôn pai sa kon drŏ-nglo inh. Wă năr dơning dơ̆ng, inh khan kơ sư: Iŏk kon drŏ-nglo ih dơ̆ng wă kơ bơ̆n pai sa! Mă-lei sư ôn lê̆ kon drŏ-nglo sư,”"
"Now it happened, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he tore his clothes; and as he passed by on the wall, the people looked, and there underneath he had sackcloth on his body.","Kơtơ̆ng duch ei roi thoi noh, pơtao hek ao sư kơdih.

"Then he said, “God do so to me and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat remains on him today!”","Pơtao ôr rơ̆n pơma pơkă khan: “Dah inh ưh kơ kăt ako Êlisê kon drŏ-nglo Saphat lei apinh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei sek tơlang, phak inh mă trăp hloh.”"
"But Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. And the king sent a man ahead of him, but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, “Do you see how this son of a murderer has sent someone to take away my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door. Is not the sound of his master’s feet behind him?”","Êlisê oei ngôi lăm hnam sư kơdih, păng lu kră pơlei kư̆m oei ngôi tăp dăr kơ sư, na pơtao wơh bơih bơngai năm pơlôch Êlisê.

"And while he was still talking with them, there was the messenger, coming down to him; and then the king said, “Surely this calamity is from the LORD; why should I wait for the LORD any longer?”","Tŏk-bŏk sư oei pơma thoi ei na lu sư 'bôh blư bơngai mă pơtao wơh ei truh, kư̆m blu pơtao truh mơ̆n, pơtao khan kơ 'bok Êlisê thoi âu: “Đei tơdrong răm truh 'nâu lĕch đơ̆ng Kră Yang.

"Then Elisha said, “Hear the word of the LORD. Thus says the LORD: ‘Tomorrow about this time a seah of fine flour shall be sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, at the gate of Samaria.’ ”","Na Êlisê khan: “Mơ̆ng bĕ nơ̆r Kră Yang khan thoi âu: Năr dơning kư̆m kơplah jơ 'nâu mơ̆n, 'bơ̆t 'măng dur Pơlei Samari tơpŭng minh hnŏng iĕ, gô tĕch minh sêikơl jên hu, păng 'ba 'bar hnŏng iĕ, kư̆m tĕch minh sêikơl jên hu mơ̆n."
"So an officer on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God and said, “Look, if the LORD would make windows in heaven, could this thing be?” And he said, “In fact, you shall see it with your eyes, but you shall not eat of it.”","Yŏng linh mă jê̆ pơtao, sư tơl nơ̆r Êlisê bơngai mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua: “Mă khan Kră Yang pơih dôm lu 'măng-'mŏk tơ plĕnh ti, tơdrong noh gơh đei hă?” Êlisê tơl: “Măt ih gô 'bôh tơdrong noh, mă-lei ih ưh kơ đei sa ôh.”"
"Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate; and they said to one another, “Why are we sitting here until we die?","'Bơ̆t 'măng dur đei puăn 'nu bơngai jĭ chin, lu sư pơma dơnuh băl: “Bơ̆n hrăn ngôi kơ kiơ 'bơ̆t dâu dĭng truh kơ lôch?”"
"If we say, ‘We will enter the city,’ the famine is in the city, and we shall die there. And if we sit here, we die also. Now therefore, come, let us surrender to the army of the Syrians.

"And they rose at twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians; and when they had come to the outskirts of the Syrian camp, to their surprise no one was there.","Thoi noh, kơplah drơ̆m kơsơ̆ lu sư năm tơ anih linh Aram; kơplah lu sư truh 'bơ̆t anih noh ưh kơ đei 'bôh bu 'bơ̆t ei."
"For the Lord had caused the army of the Syrians to hear the noise of chariots and the noise of horses—the noise of a great army; so they said to one another, “Look, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians to attack us!”","Yua kơ Kră Yang hlôi pơm kơ lu linh Aram kơtơ̆ng jơwa gre aseh păng aseh mơdrâp mơdrăp, păng kơtơ̆ng jơwa khŭl linh lơ na lu sư pơma dơnuh: “Ei, pơtao đe Isơrael mưng iŏk lu pơtao đe Hêtit păng pơtao đe Êyiptơ wă blah bơ̆n.”"
"Therefore they arose and fled at twilight, and left the camp intact—their tents, their horses, and their donkeys—and they fled for their lives.","Lu sư iung hloi, kơdâu ôn kơplah drơ̆m kơsơ̆, achăng lê̆ anih aseh păng aseh iĕ, lê̆ anih lu sư oei thoi hmă; lu sư ôn wă kơ hlot akâu gơh arih đĕch."
"And when these lepers came to the outskirts of the camp, they went into one tent and ate and drank, and carried from it silver and gold and clothing, and went and hid them; then they came back and entered another tent, and carried some from there also, and went and hid it.","Lăp lu bơngai jĭ chin truh 'bơ̆t anih ei, lu sư mơ̆t sŏng sa lăm ei, thoi noh, lu sư iŏk hu, maih păng hơbĕn ao năm ôn lê̆.

"Then they said to one another, “We are not doing right. This day is a day of good news, and we remain silent. If we wait until morning light, some punishment will come upon us. Now therefore, come, let us go and tell the king’s household.”","Kơplah ei, lu sư pơma dơnuh băl khan: “Bơ̆n pơm thoi âu ưh kơ trŏ; năr âu đei tơdrong 'lơ̆ng tơdrong 'nă hal, dah bơ̆n wă thĕng đĕch, dĭng 'brưch pơgê hơdah, lei lu bơ̆n gô glăi, bĕ bơ̆n jah năm roi tơdrong 'nâu kơ pơtao.”"
"So they went and called to the gatekeepers of the city, and told them, saying, “We went to the Syrian camp, and surprisingly no one was there, not a human sound—only horses and donkeys tied, and the tents intact.”","Na lu sư năm hloi, krao lu linh gak 'măng dur pơlei, roi kơ lu sư: “Nhôn năm truh tơ kơđông linh Aram, rơhiăng ưh kơ 'bôh bơngai bu, kư̆m ưh kơ đei kơtơ̆ng 'bơ̆r bu mơ̆n, 'bôh lăp lu aseh, lu aseh iĕ oei chô̆ păng lu bơsŭn achăng lê̆ thoi so.”"
"And the gatekeepers called out, and they told it to the king’s household inside.","Na linh gak 'măng krao hloi bơngai năm roi tơbăt mơ̆t lăm hnam pơtao."
"So the king arose in the night and said to his servants, “Let me now tell you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry; therefore they have gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, ‘When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city.’ ”","Pơtao iung kơmăng, khan kơ lu đĭch đam sư: “Ĭnh wă roi tơbăt ăn kơ lu iĕm tơdrong kiơ mă lu bơngai Aram chă đon wă pơm kơ lu bơ̆n.

"And one of his servants answered and said, “Please, let several men take five of the remaining horses which are left in the city. Look, they may either become like all the multitude of Israel that are left in it; or indeed, I say, they may become like all the multitude of Israel left from those who are consumed; so let us send them and see.”","Minh 'nu đĭch đam pơtao khan: “Ơ pơtao, apinh ih wơh hơdôm 'nu drŏ-nglo năm rôp pơđăm tŏ aseh mă oei oei lăm pơlei, ăn bơngai hao, năm lăng lăng tơ ei, mă ưh lu sư kư̆m wă lôch thoi bơngai Isơrael mă oei lôch och och bơih 'nâu.”"
"Therefore they took two chariots with horses; and the king sent them in the direction of the Syrian army, saying, “Go and see.”","Thoi noh, lu sư iŏk 'bar tŏ gre aseh, tah aseh năm, pơtao athei lu sư năm kiơ̆ 'moi khŭl linh Aram păng pơkă khan: “Năm bĕ lăng lăng wă kơ băt thoi yơ tơpă.”"
"And they went after them to the Jordan; and indeed all the road was full of garments and weapons which the Syrians had thrown away in their haste. So the messengers returned and told the king.","Lu sư 'moi lu linh Aram truh tơ đak krong Jôrđăn, lu sư 'bôh hơbĕn ao păng tơmam lu sư hŭt lê̆ thơ̆r thăr glơch glach tôch môch kơ trong, kơplah lu sư hăt hot kơdâu ôn 'noh.

"Then the people went out and plundered the tents of the Syrians. So a seah of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD.","Đơ̆ng noh kon pơlei pơla lĕch đơ̆ng lăm pơlei tơkan iŏk tơmam đơ̆ng lăm kơđông linh đe Aram.

"Now the king had appointed the officer on whose hand he leaned to have charge of the gate. But the people trampled him in the gate, and he died, just as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him.","Pơtao đei ăn bơih kơ yŏng linh, bơngai mă oei lăm anih pơtao noh, ăn sư gak 'măng dur pơlei, mă-lei kon pơlei juă ok ba sư 'bơ̆t 'măng dur ei, na sư lôch hloi, thoi nơ̆r Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei mă Êlisê đei khan lê̆ adrol, kơplah pơtao năm tơ'bơ̆p sư."
"So it happened just as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, “Two seahs of barley for a shekel, and a seah of fine flour for a shekel, shall be sold tomorrow about this time in the gate of Samaria.”","Dôm tơdrong đei truh thoi nơ̆r Êlisê bơngai mă 'Bok Kei-Dei yua đei khan kơ pơtao thoi âu: “Năr dơning kư̆m kơplah jơ 'nâu mơ̆n, 'bơ̆t 'măng jang Pơlei Samari, 'bar hnŏng 'ba tĕch minh sêikơl jên hu păng minh hnŏng tơpŭng kư̆m tĕch minh sêikơl jên hu mơ̆n."
"Then that officer had answered the man of God, and said, “Now look, if the LORD would make windows in heaven, could such a thing be?” And he had said, “In fact, you shall see it with your eyes, but you shall not eat of it.”","Yŏng linh kư̆m tơl Êlisê bơngai mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua: “Mă khan Kră Yang pơih dôm lu 'măng-'mŏk tơ plĕnh ti ră, tơdrong 'nei gơh đei hă?” Na Êlisê khan dơ̆ng: “Măt ih gô 'bôh tơdrong 'noh, mă-lei ih ưh kơ đei sa ôh.”"
"And so it happened to him, for the people trampled him in the gate, and he died.","Na tơdrong mă đei truh 'noh 'blep thoi noh tơpă; yua kơ lu kon pơlei juă pơhlơ̆r lê̆ yŏng linh ei 'bơ̆t 'măng jang pơlei, păng sư lôch hloi."
"Then Elisha spoke to the woman whose son he had restored to life, saying, “Arise and go, you and your household, and stay wherever you can; for the LORD has called for a famine, and furthermore, it will come upon the land for seven years.”","Êlisê khan kơ bơngai drŏ-kăn mĕ bơngai 'lơ̆p drŏ-nglo đêl sư tơiung arih ki 'noh: “Iung bĕ, chông hnam dơnŏ ih jăk tơ anih ayơ mă iĕm gơh oei, yua kơ Kră Yang wă ăn kơ dêh char Isơrael pơngot rơwĕt lăm tơpơh sơnăm.”"
"So the woman arose and did according to the saying of the man of God, and she went with her household and dwelt in the land of the Philistines seven years.","Thoi noh, na bơngai drŏ-kăn ei iung hloi, chu kiơ̆ nơ̆r Êlisê bơngai 'Bok Kei-Dei yua, sư hăm hnam dơnŏ sư jăk oei tơ dêh Philistin tơpơh sơnăm."
"It came to pass, at the end of seven years, that the woman returned from the land of the Philistines; and she went to make an appeal to the king for her house and for her land.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ tơpơh sơnăm noh, bơngai drŏ-kăn ei lĕch đơ̆ng dêh Philistin brŏk tơ Pơlei sư, sư năm apinh pơtao wă kơ sư gơh đei iŏk dơ̆ng hnam păng mir chŭn sư so."
"Then the king talked with Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, saying, “Tell me, please, all the great things Elisha has done.”","Kơplah 'noh, pơtao oei pơma dơnuh hăm Gêhasi đam Êlisê bơngai mă 'Bok Kei-Dei yua pơtao jet: “Ih athei roi ăn kơ ĭnh tôm tơdrong tih mă Êlisê pơm bơih.”"
"Now it happened, as he was telling the king how he had restored the dead to life, that there was the woman whose son he had restored to life, appealing to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, “My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life.”","Gêhasi oei roi ăn kơ pơtao mơ̆ng thoi yơ Êlisê hlôi tơiung arih minh 'nu bơngai đơ̆ng lôch, na blư bơngai drŏ-kăn mĕ bơngai 'lơ̆p mă đêl Êlisê tơiung arih noh truh, sư apinh pơtao ăn kơ sư gơh đei iŏk dơ̆ng hnam păng mir chŭn sư.

"And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed a certain officer for her, saying, “Restore all that was hers, and all the proceeds of the field from the day that she left the land until now.”","Pơtao jet hloi duch ei, na duch ei roi ăn kơ sư tơdrong noh.

"Then Elisha went to Damascus, and Ben-Hadad king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, “The man of God has come here.”","Êlisê năm truh tơ pơlei Đamas. Kơplah noh Ben Hadat pơtao Aram jĭ. Đei bơngai roi ăn kơ pơtao khan: “Bơngai Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua, 'nao truh tơ âu.”"
"And the king said to Hazael, “Take a present in your hand, and go to meet the man of God, and inquire of the LORD by him, saying, ‘Shall I recover from this disease?’ ”","“Pơtao athei Hasael: Chĕp ba minh pôm tơmam pơyơ̆r năm sơng Êlisê bơngai Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua, gơnang kơ sư krao apinh jet Kră Yang: “Ĭnh hăm wă kĕ klaih đơ̆ng jĭ dah ưh?”"
"So Hazael went to meet him and took a present with him, of every good thing of Damascus, forty camel-loads; and he came and stood before him, and said, “Your son Ben-Hadad king of Syria has sent me to you, saying, ‘Shall I recover from this disease?’ ”","Thoi noh, Hasael năm sơng Êlisê bơngai mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua, chông ba puăn-jĭt tŏ aseh lăk-đa, chơ ba dôm tơmam mă 'lơ̆ng ngơ-ngei đơ̆ng pơlei Đamas noh, wă ăn kơ Êlisê bơngai mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua, sư năm tơ'bơ̆p Êlisê, na khan: “Kon drŏ-nglo ih Ben Hadat, pơtao đe Aram, sư wơh inh năm tơ ih sư wă apinh khan: “Ĭnh hăm wă kĕ klaih đơ̆ng jĭ 'nâu dah ưh?”"
"And Elisha said to him, “Go, say to him, ‘You shall certainly recover.’ However the LORD has shown me that he will really die.”","Êlisê tơl: “Ih brŏk roi ăn kơ sư bĕ: Ơ pơtao sĭt ih gô klaih đơ̆ng jĭ, mă khan thoi ei Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei tơbăt ăn kơ ĭnh sư noh gô lôch.”"
"Then he set his countenance in a stare until he was ashamed; and the man of God wept.","Êlisê, bơngai mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua pơglăn pơnhen tơ Hasael đunh dĭng mah sư mơlâu, đơ̆ng noh Êlisê khĭk khơ̆k nhơ̆m."
"And Hazael said, “Why is my lord weeping?” He answered, “Because I know the evil that you will do to the children of Israel: Their strongholds you will set on fire, and their young men you will kill with the sword; and you will dash their children, and rip open their women with child.”","Hasael jet: “Ơ yŏng tơ'ngla ĭnh, yua kơ kiơ ih nhơ̆m?” Êlisê tơl: “Yua kơ ĭnh băt ih gô pơm kơnê̆ pơrăm lu bơngai Isơrael, ih gô soh chhông lu pơlei tih kơjăp noh, pơlôch lu bơngai drŏ-nglo oei hơmuh hơmŏng pơlôch hăm đao, juă pơhlơ̆r lu hơ'lơ̆p iĕ, păng roch klak lu bơngai drŏ-kăn oei anăp.”"
"So Hazael said, “But what is your servant—a dog, that he should do this gross thing?” And Elisha answered, “The LORD has shown me that you will become king over Syria.”","Hasael tơl: “Đam ih noh bu?

"Then he departed from Elisha, and came to his master, who said to him, “What did Elisha say to you?” And he answered, “He told me you would surely recover.”","Hasael weh hloi đơ̆ng Êlisê păng brŏk tơ yŏng tơ'ngla sư; yŏng tơ'ngla sư jet: “Êlisê roi ăn kơ ih liơ?” Sư tơl: “Êlisê roi ăn kơ ĭnh khan ih gô praih hiôk.”"
"But it happened on the next day that he took a thick cloth and dipped it in water, and spread it over his face so that he died; and Hazael reigned in his place.","Năr dơning Hasael iŏk khăn djrŭ lăm đak, iŏk khăn noh klơ̆p lê̆ muh măt Ben Hadat, na 'bok ei lôch hloi.

"Now in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Jehoshaphat having been king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat began to reign as king of Judah.","Lăm sơnăm mă pơđăm, chăl Jôram, kon drŏ-nglo Ahap, pơgơ̆r dêh Isơrael, na Jêhôram kon drŏ-nglo Jêhôsaphat pơgơ̆r dêh Juđa."
"He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.","Kơplah Jêhôram tŏk pơm pơtao, sư 'nao pêng-jĭt 'bar sơnăm; sư pơgơ̆r tơhngam sơnăm tơ Pơlei Jêrusalem."
"And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife; and he did evil in the sight of the LORD.","Sư năm kiơ̆ trong lu pơtao Isơrael, lei-lăi thoi pơtao Ahap pơm bơih yua kơ akăn sư 'noh kon pơtao Ahap.

"Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah, for the sake of His servant David, as He promised him to give a lamp to him and his sons forever.","Mă-lei, Kră Yang mơnat yua kơ Đawit đĭch đam sư, na sư ưh kơ wă pơlôch pơrăm lê̆ adrĕch adrung Juđa ôh, yua kơ Sư pơkă wă 'măn minh pôm ŭnh kơđeng ăn kơ Đawit păng adrĕch adrung sư ling-lang khŏm khŏm."
"In his days Edom revolted against Judah’s authority, and made a king over themselves.","Lăm chăl Jêhôram, đei lu bơngai Eđôm iung blah lu bơngai Juđa păng pôk ăn đei pơtao kơdih."
"So Joram went to Zair, and all his chariots with him. Then he rose by night and attacked the Edomites who had surrounded him and the captains of the chariots; and the troops fled to their tents.","Yua kơ thoi noh Jêhôram năm tơ Pơlei Sar, anhăk ba đĭ-đăng gre aseh linh sư.

"Thus Edom has been in revolt against Judah’s authority to this day. And Libnah revolted at that time.","Thoi noh, lu bơngai Eđôm blah đe Juđa, lu sư ưh kơ wă chu bơngai Juđa pơgơ̆r truh tơ dang ei. Hơdai kơplah noh mơ̆n Pơlei Lipna kư̆m iung blah mơ̆n."
"Now the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?","Lu tơdrong hơ'mon gah Jêhôram, hơ'mon tôm tơdrong đêl sư pơm đe đei chih lăm sơ̆p hla bơar hơ'mon gah lu pơtao."
"So Joram rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David. Then Ahaziah his son reigned in his place.","Jêhôram lôch, brŏk pơdơh tơ yă 'bok sư, đe 'bŭ hơdai hăm yă 'bok sư tơ Pơlei Đawit. Đơ̆ng noh, Ahasia kon drŏ-nglo sư pơtrơp đêl anih sư."
"In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, began to reign.","Lăm sơnăm mă mơjĭt-'bar, chăl Jôram kon drŏ-nglo Ahap pơtao đe Isơrael pơgơ̆r, na Ahasia kon drŏ-nglo Jêhôram pơtao đe Juđa tŏk pơm pơtao."
"Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athaliah the granddaughter of Omri, king of Israel.","Ahasia sư 'bar-jĭt sơnăm kơplah sư tŏk pơm pơtao păng sư pơgơ̆r minh sơnăm tơ Pơlei Jêrusalem.

"And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the LORD, like the house of Ahab, for he was the son-in-law of the house of Ahab.","Sư năm kiơ̆ trong adrĕch adrung Ahap, pơm kơnê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang lei-lăi thoi Ahap hlôi pơm bơih, yua kơ sư ŏng pơtao Ahap."
"Now he went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.","Ahasia sư năm hơdai hăm Jôram kon drŏ-nglo Ahap, năm truh tơ Pơlei Ramôt Gileat wă tơblah hăm Hasael pơtao đe Aram, lu sư tơblah noh, pơtao Jôram rơka."
"Then King Joram went back to Jezreel to recover from the wounds which the Syrians had inflicted on him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.","Na sư wơ̆t brŏk tơ Pơlei Jêsreel hơmet rơka đêl linh Aram prah 'bơm sư tơ pơlei Ramôt, 'bơ̆t năr sư tơblah hăm Hasael, pơtao đe Aram.

"And Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets, and said to him, “Get yourself ready, take this flask of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth Gilead.","Êlisê bơngai khan lê̆ adrol, sư krao minh 'nu lăm lu khŭl bơngai khan lê̆ adrol na khan: “Iŏk tơlei tơ̆n, tơ̆n kơiĕng ih bĕ, chĕp get đak 'bâu phu 'nâu, năm tơ Pơlei Ramôt Galaat."
"Now when you arrive at that place, look there for Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, and go in and make him rise up from among his associates, and take him to an inner room.","Mưh ih truh tơ noh, ih athei chă Jêhu kon drŏ-nglo Jêhôsaphat, sâu Nimsi; na ih gô mơ̆t, athei sư iung weh đơ̆ng 'nhŏng oh sư, păng ih chông sư mơ̆t lăm anih hrĕp hơdrô̆"
"Then take the flask of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, ‘Thus says the LORD: “I have anointed you king over Israel.” ’ Then open the door and flee, and do not delay.”","Ih iŏk get đak 'bâu phu, tuh kơpal kơ̆l sư păng khan: “Kră Yang khan thoi âu: Inh tuh đak 'bâu phu ăn kơ ih pơm pơtao Isơrael.” Đơ̆ng noh ih athei pơih 'măng lĕch weh hloi, 'nĕ kơ hiơ̆ hŏ."
"So the young man, the servant of the prophet, went to Ramoth Gilead.","Na bơngai tơdăm noh, sư bơngai khan lê̆ adrol oei mơlôh năm truh tơ Pơlei Ramôt Gileat."
"And when he arrived, there were the captains of the army sitting; and he said, “I have a message for you, Commander.” Jehu said, “For which one of us?” And he said, “For you, Commander.”","Kơplah sư truh, lu 'bok tih khŭl linh oei hơ-oei akŭm pơđâu sư khan kơ Jêhu: “Ơ 'bok kuan tih, inh đei tơdrong wă pơma dơnuh hăm ih!

"Then he arose and went into the house. And he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, “Thus says the LORD God of Israel: ‘I have anointed you king over the people of the LORD, over Israel.","Thoi noh, Jêhu gruih iung mơ̆t lăm hnam, na bơngai tơdăm ei tuh đak 'bâu phu kơpal kơ̆l sư păng khan: “Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael khan thoi âu: Inh rơih iŏk ih ăn kơ đe tuh đak 'bâu phu ăn kơ ih pơm pơtao đe Isơrael wei-lăng kon pơlei Kră Yang."
"You shall strike down the house of Ahab your master, that I may avenge the blood of My servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.","Ih gô blah pơlôch adrĕch Ahap yŏng tơ'ngla ih păng Inh gô pơm 'mong pơrăm yă Jêsebel đêl pham bơngai mă sư pơlôch, lu bơngai khan lê̆ adrol, đĭch đam ĭnh, hăm pham đĭ-đăng đĭch đam Kră Yang."

"So I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah.","păng ĭnh pơm kơ adrĕch Ahap lei-lăi thoi adrĕch Jêrôbôam kon drŏ-nglo Nêba păng lei-lăi thoi adrĕch Baasa kon drŏ-nglo Ahija."
"The dogs shall eat Jezebel on the plot of ground at Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her.’ ” And he opened the door and fled.","Kŏ gô sa akâu yă Jêsebel lăm char glă Jêsreel, ưh kơ đei bu 'bŭ sư.” Na bơngai tơdăm ei pơih 'măng păng kơdâu weh hloi."
"Then Jehu came out to the servants of his master, and one said to him, “Is all well?

"Then each man hastened to take his garment and put it under him on the top of the steps; and they blew trumpets, saying, “Jehu is king!”","Lu sư wang hăt hot iŏk hơbĕn ao kơdih lơ̆k tơ ala jơ̆ng Jêhu lơ̆k rok lu kơnao kung. Đơ̆ng noh lu sư hlôm tơgiĕp păng ôr re khan: “Jêhu pơm pơtao!”"
"So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had been defending Ramoth Gilead, he and all Israel, against Hazael king of Syria.","Thoi noh Jêhu kon drŏ-nglo Jêhôsaphat, sâu Nimsi, sư chă đon wă blah pơtao Jôram.

"But King Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds which the Syrians had inflicted on him when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, “If you are so minded, let no one leave or escape from the city to go and tell it in Jezreel.”","Mă-lei, Jôram hlôi wih bơih tơ Jêsreel wă hơmet jĭ rơka sư đêl linh đe Aram prah 'bơm sư 'bơ̆t sư tơblah Hasael pơtao đe Aram, na Jêhu khan: “Dah lu iĕm lăp đon, 'nĕ kơ ăn minh 'nu bu lĕch klĕnh đơ̆ng pơlei âu năm roi ăn kơ Pơlei Jesreel.”"
"So Jehu rode in a chariot and went to Jezreel, for Joram was laid up there; and Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram.","Thoi noh, Jêhu hao gre aseh năm tơ Pơlei Jêsreel Jôram oei păn tơ noh. Ahasia pơtao đe Juđa kư̆m jur tơ noh năm lăng Jôram."
"Now a watchman stood on the tower in Jezreel, and he saw the company of Jehu as he came, and said, “I see a company of men.” And Joram said, “Get a horseman and send him to meet them, and let him say, ‘Is it peace?’ ”","Lĭnh gak dơ̆ng kơpal hnam thôt lăm pơlei Jêsreel 'bôh khŭl linh Jêhu truh na sư ôr re khan: “Inh 'bôh khŭl linh năm tơ âu.” Jôram khan athei: “Năm wơh minh 'nu linh hao aseh năm sơng lu sư tơ noh păng jet khan: Hăm hiôk-hian ưh?”"
"So the horseman went to meet him, and said, “Thus says the king: ‘Is it peace?’ ” And Jehu said, “What have you to do with peace? Turn around and follow me.” So the watchman reported, saying, “The messenger went to them, but is not coming back.”","Thoi noh, đe wơh minh 'nu linh hao aseh năm sơng Jêhu păng roi ăn kơ sư khan: “Pơtao jet: Hăm oei hiôk-hian ưh?” Jêhu tơl: “Tơdrong hiôk-hian 'bơm kiơ kơ ih?

"Then he sent out a second horseman who came to them, and said, “Thus says the king: ‘Is it peace?’ ” And Jehu answered, “What have you to do with peace?

"So the watchman reported, saying, “He went up to them and is not coming back; and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi, for he drives furiously!”","Lĭnh gak roi dơ̆ng khan: “Bơngai mă đe wơh noh sư năm truh tơ ei bơih, mă ưh kơ 'bôh brŏk.

"Then Joram said, “Make ready.” And his chariot was made ready. Then Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot; and they went out to meet Jehu, and met him on the property of Naboth the Jezreelite.","Na Jôram khan: “Iŏk kơ ĭnh gre aseh bĕ;” Na đe iŏk gre aseh ăn kơ sư hao năm; Jôram pơtao đe Isơrael păng Ahasia pơtao đe Juđa, bre sư hao gre aseh sư kơdih kơdih năm sơng Jêhu na lu sư tơ'bơ̆p Jêhu 'bơ̆t teh mir Nabôt bơngai Pơlei Jêsreel."
"Now it happened, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, “Is it peace, Jehu?” So he answered, “What peace, as long as the harlotries of your mother Jezebel and her witchcraft are so many?”","Lăp 'bôh Jêhu na Jôram jet: “Ơ Jêhu, hăm trŏ kơ ih năm wă kơ hiôk-hian?” Mă-lei, Jêhu tơl khan: “Na!

"Then Joram turned around and fled, and said to Ahaziah, “Treachery, Ahaziah!”","Jôram gơwĕch gre aseh sư kơdâu weh ôn păng roi kơ Ahasia băt: “Đe chă đon wă blah bơ̆n.”"
"Now Jehu drew his bow with full strength and shot Jehoram between his arms; and the arrow came out at his heart, and he sank down in his chariot.","Jêhu iŏk hră sư gŭt prah Jôram 'brơ̆m 'bơm 'bơ̆t sơlam 'bar pah hơngiĕng, klĕch jrok tơ plei nuih sư, na sư pơ̆k lôch hloi lăm gre aseh sư."
"Then Jehu said to Bidkar his captain, “Pick him up, and throw him into the tract of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember, when you and I were riding together behind Ahab his father, that the LORD laid this burden upon him","Na Jêhu khan kơ Bithan kuan wei sư: “Iŏk atâu sư 'nâu klơ̆m lê̆ lăm mir Nabôt Pơlei Jêsreel; ih hăm 'blŏk, minh 'măng ki ba đih hao gre aseh kiơ̆ 'moi Ahap, 'bă sư, na Kră Yang khan lê̆ gah sư"
"‘Surely I saw yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons,’ says the LORD, ‘and I will repay you in this plot,’ says the LORD. Now therefore, take and throw him on the plot of ground, according to the word of the LORD.”","“Kră Yang khan: Tơpă năr brei Inh 'bôh bơih pham Nabôt păng pham lu kon drŏ-nglo sư: Inh gô pơm plơ̆ kơ ih tơ mir 'nâu mơ̆n.

"But when Ahaziah king of Judah saw this, he fled by the road to Beth Haggan. So Jehu pursued him, and said, “Shoot him also in the chariot.” And they shot him at the Ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. Then he fled to Megiddo, and died there.","Lăp Ahasia pơtao đe Juđa 'bôh tơdrong noh na kơdâu ôn tơklă Pơlei Bet Hagan.

"And his servants carried him in the chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in the City of David.","Lu đĭch đam sư tah atâu sư lăm gre aseh na chơ ba brŏk tơ pơlei Jêrusalem păng 'bŭ lăm bơsat hơdai hăm lu yă 'bok sư tơ Pơlei Đawit sơ̆."
"In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab, Ahaziah had become king over Judah.","(Ahasia tŏk pơm pơtao đe Juđa 'bơ̆t sơnăm mă mơjĭt-mônh, chăl pơtao Jôram, kon drŏ-nglo Ahap pơgơ̆r đe Isơrael.)"
"Now when Jehu had come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she put paint on her eyes and adorned her head, and looked through a window.","Kơplah Jêhu năm truh tơ pơlei Jêsreel.

"Then, as Jehu entered at the gate, she said, “Is it peace, Zimri, murderer of your master?”","Lăp Jêhu năm mơ̆t trong 'măng dur pơlei na yă ei khan: “Ơ Simri, bơngai pơlôch yŏng tơ'ngla inh oei liĕm akâu hiôk-hian mơ̆n?”"
"And he looked up at the window, and said, “Who is on my side? Who?” So two or three eunuchs looked out at him.","Jêhu ngơk lăng tơ 'măng-'mŏk na jet: “Tơ kơpal 'noh, bu gah ĭnh? Bu? Na 'bar pêng 'nu kuan krĕo nger lăng tơ sư."
"Then he said, “Throw her down.” So they threw her down, and some of her blood spattered on the wall and on the horses; and he trampled her underfoot.","Sư athei: “Iĕm tơlơ̆ hơtat sư tơ teh jah.” Lu sư tơlơ̆ hơtat hloi yă ei tơ teh, na pham sư tơprah tơ tơnăr hnam, tơ akâu aseh, đơ̆ng noh aseh yak pơjuă akâu sư."
"And when he had gone in, he ate and drank. Then he said, “Go now, see to this accursed woman, and bury her, for she was a king’s daughter.”","Jêhu mơ̆t lăm hnam, sŏng sa đang bơih na sư khan: “Iĕm năm lăng drŏ-kăn kơlĕl răm 'noh hei năm! Păng iĕm 'bŭ hơmet sư, yua kơ sư kon pơtao.”"
"So they went to bury her, but they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands.","Thoi noh lu đĭch đam wă năm 'bŭ sư; mă-lei lu sư 'bôh oei pă pôm kơ̆l, na 'bar pah jơ̆ng păng 'bar pah tơpang ti đĕch bơih 'bơ̆t dei."
"Therefore they came back and told him. And he said, “This is the word of the LORD, which He spoke by His servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, ‘On the plot of ground at Jezreel dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezebel","Lu sư wơ̆t roi ăn kơ Jêhu yŏng tơ'ngla sư.

"and the corpse of Jezebel shall be as refuse on the surface of the field, in the plot at Jezreel, so that they shall not say, “Here lies Jezebel.” ’ ”","Păng atâu sư noh gô hĕch hoch nhen mơ̆r 'bơ̆t teh, tơ lăm mir chŭn Pơlei Jêsreel, dĭng đe mă pă gơh khan: “'Nâu bơih Jêsebel.”"
"Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote and sent letters to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to those who reared Ahab’s sons, saying","Tơ Samari, đei tơpơh-jĭt 'nu kon drŏ-nglo Ahap oei lăm Pơlei Samari.

"Now as soon as this letter comes to you, since your master’s sons are with you, and you have chariots and horses, a fortified city also, and weapons","“Tơ anih lu iĕm đei lu kon drŏ-nglo yŏng tơ'ngla iĕm, đei lơ gre, đei aseh hai, đei khêl đao tơmam tơblah păng đei lơ pơlei tih kơjăp tăm.

"choose the best qualified of your master’s sons, set him on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s house.","iĕm athei rơih iŏk lăm lu kon drŏ-nglo yŏng tơ'ngla iĕm, bơngai ayơ mă tơpăt tôm tơdrong gơh hơgei hloh, pôk sư oei 'bơ̆t tang-dŏ 'bă sư, đơ̆ng noh iung tơblah yua kơ adrĕch adrung yŏng tơ'ngla iĕm.”"
"But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, “Look, two kings could not stand up to him; how then can we stand?”","Mă-lei lu sư hli tơrơ dêh, păng khan: “'Nhŏ kơ 'bar 'nu pơtao ưh kơ kĕ dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp sư, tơma nhôn khan tơblah sư kĕ liơ 'nei?”"
"And he who was in charge of the house, and he who was in charge of the city, the elders also, and those who reared the sons, sent to Jehu, saying, “We are your servants, we will do all you tell us; but we will not make anyone king. Do what is good in your sight.”","Kuan wei hnam pơtao păng lu kuan wei pơlei păng lu kră pơlei, păng bơngai bơtho wei-lăng kon drŏ-nglo Ahap, pơtruh nơ̆r roi kơ Jêhu khan: “Lu nhôn jơ̆ đĭch đam ih; lu nhôn gô pơm tôm tơdrong ih athei nhôn pơm, lu nhôn ưh kơ wă chă rơih bu pơm pơtao ôh, ih pơm bĕ tơdrong kiơ, kiơ̆ kơ ih tơchĕng khan lăp trŏ.”"
"Then he wrote a second letter to them, saying: If you are for me and will obey my voice, take the heads of the men, your master’s sons, and come to me at Jezreel by this time tomorrow. Now the king’s sons, seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who were rearing them.","Jêhu chih kơthơ wơ̆t mă 'bar khan: “Dah iĕm mơ̆t gah ĭnh păng 'maih wă chu kiơ̆ mơ̆ng ĭnh athei, lei iĕm athei chơ̆ng kơ̆l lu kon drŏ-nglo yŏng tơ'ngla iĕm; đơ̆ng noh năr dơning, kư̆m kơplah jơ 'nâu mơ̆n, iĕm athei chĕp ba kơ̆l noh năm tơ ĭnh tơ Pơlei Jêsreel.” Thoi noh, lu kon drŏ-nglo pơtao, đĭ-đăng tơpơh-jĭt 'nu oei tơ lăm hnam lu bơngai yŏng mơng lăm pơlei tih ei ngăl, đe bơtho, 'me rong lu sư."
"So it was, when the letter came to them, that they took the king’s sons and slaughtered seventy persons, put their heads in baskets and sent them to him at Jezreel.","Lu đe ei đei iŏk kơthơ noh, na rôp hĭ tơpơh-jĭt 'nu kon drŏ-nglo pơtao, pơlôch đĭ, đơ̆ng noh tah lê̆ kơ̆l lu sư lăm bai, ba truh tơ Jêhu tơ Pơlei Jêsreel."
"Then a messenger came and told him, saying, “They have brought the heads of the king’s sons.” And he said, “Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until morning.”","Đei bơngai đe wơh năm truh tơ ei roi ăn kơ sư khan: “Đe chĕp ba kơ̆l lu kon drŏ-nglo pơtao noh tơ âu bơih.” Jêhu tơl: “Iĕm dan 'bơ̆t 'măng dur pơlei, dan pơm 'bar pôi, lê̆ 'bơ̆t dei dĭng truh pơgê dơning.”"
"So it was, in the morning, that he went out and stood, and said to all the people, “You are righteous. Indeed I conspired against my master and killed him; but who killed all these?","Pơgê đơ̆ng rŏng, sư lĕch, dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp đĭ-đăng kon pơlei, na khan: “Lu iĕm ưh kơ 'bơm, ưh kơ pơm yoch ôh.

"Know now that nothing shall fall to the earth of the word of the LORD which the LORD spoke concerning the house of Ahab; for the LORD has done what He spoke by His servant Elijah.”","Lei na dang ei, bơ̆n athei băt lăm dôm nơ̆r Kră Yang đei khan bơih gah adrĕch Ahap, ưh kơ đei nơ̆r ayơ huŏng tơ teh; yua kơ Kră Yang pơkeh bơih nơ̆r sư pơkă mă sư yua 'bơ̆r Êli đĭch đam sư pơma.”"
"So Jehu killed all who remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men and his close acquaintances and his priests, until he left him none remaining.","Jêhu kư̆m pơlôch đĭ lu adrĕch Ahap mă oei oei lăm Pơlei Jêsreel, pơlôch hloi kuan tih, lu buăl juăt sư ngơ-ngei, păng lu 'bok soi tơm sư, ưh pă đei lê̆ minh 'nu bu hloi."
"And he arose and departed and went to Samaria. On the way, at Beth Eked of the Shepherds","Đơ̆ng noh, Jêhu iung năm tơ Pơlei Samari. Tơ rok trong, tơ Pơlei Bet Êket, bơsŭn bơngai wei triu"
"Jehu met with the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, “Who are you?” So they answered, “We are the brothers of Ahaziah; we have come down to greet the sons of the king and the sons of the queen mother.”","sư tơ'bơ̆p hĭ lu 'nhŏng oh Ahasia pơtao đe Juđa, sư jet: “Lu iĕm bu?” Lu sư tơl: “Lu nhôn 'nhŏng oh Ahasia, nhôn wă jur năm ngôi tơ lu kon drŏ-nglo pơtao hăm lu kon drŏ-nglo mĕ pơtao."
"And he said, “Take them alive!” So they took them alive, and killed them at the well of Beth Eked, forty-two men; and he left none of them.","Na Jêhu athei lu đam sư: “Năm rôp lu sư, rôp arih.” Đe rôp lu sư, arih, đĭ-đăng puăn-jĭt 'bar 'nu; đơ̆ng noh pơlôch lu sư 'bơ̆t jê̆ đak sơlŭng, Pơlei Bet Êket bơsŭn bơngai wei triu.

"Now when he departed from there, he met Jehonadab the son of Rechab, coming to meet him; and he greeted him and said to him, “Is your heart right, as my heart is toward your heart?” And Jehonadab answered, “It is.” Jehu said, “If it is, give me your hand.” So he gave him his hand, and he took him up to him into the chariot.","Lăp Jêhu yak weh đơ̆ng noh, sư tơ'bơ̆p Jêhônadap, kon drŏ-nglo Rêkap tŏk-bŏk oei năm sơng sư.

"And when he came to Samaria, he killed all who remained to Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed them, according to the word of the LORD which He spoke to Elijah.","Lăp sư mơ̆t lăm Pơlei Samari bơih, sư pơlôch pơđĭ lu bơngai lăm adrĕch Ahap lăm Pơlei Samari dĭng mah adrĕch 'nei goh hloi, thoi nơ̆r Kră Yang khan kơ Êli bơih."
"Then Jehu gathered all the people together, and said to them, “Ahab served Baal a little, Jehu will serve him much.","Jêhu pơpôi đĭ-đăng kon pơlei păng khan kơ lu sư: “Ahap kơkuh jang kơ yang gah Baal tŏ sĕt dêh: Inh Jêhu gô kơkuh jang ăn kơ yang Baal lơ hloh.”"
"Now therefore, call to me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests. Let no one be missing, for I have a great sacrifice for Baal. Whoever is missing shall not live.” But Jehu acted deceptively, with the intent of destroying the worshipers of Baal.","Dang ei na akŭm pơpôi ăn kơ ĭnh dôm lu bơngai khan lê̆ adrol yang Baal noh bĕ lu bơngai kơkuh kơ sư păng đĭ-đăng lu 'bok soi sư.

"Then Jehu sent throughout all Israel; and all the worshipers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left who did not come. So they came into the temple of Baal, and the temple of Baal was full from one end to the other.","Jêhu wơh lu bơngai năm jơ̆p-jang char Isơrael roi tơbăt athei đĭ-đăng đĭch đam mă jang kơ yang Baal khŏm năm truh.

"And he said to the one in charge of the wardrobe, “Bring out vestments for all the worshipers of Baal.” So he brought out vestments for them.","Na Jêhu khan kơ bơngai wei ao kơ̆m giĕng, chă asong ao kơ̆m giĕng 'noh kơ đĭch đam jang kơ yang Baal 'noh bĕ. Na bơngai ei chă asong lu sư ao 'noh."
"Then Jehu and Jehonadab the son of Rechab went into the temple of Baal, and said to the worshipers of Baal, “Search and see that no servants of the LORD are here with you, but only the worshipers of Baal.”","Jêhu păng Jêhônadap, kon drŏ-nglo Rêkap mơ̆t lăm hnam yang Baal, khan kơ lu bơngai kơkuh kơ yang Baal: “Iĕm chă lăng mă nhen, tơ âu hăm đei bơngai ayơ đĭch đam Kră Yang ưh?

"So they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had appointed for himself eighty men on the outside, and had said, “If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escapes, whoever lets him escape, it shall be his life for the life of the other.”","Lu sư mơ̆t wă pơyơ̆r dôm tơmam soi, păng tơmam soi 'buh pơkhôi.

"Now it happened, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, “Go in and kill them; let no one come out!” And they killed them with the edge of the sword; then the guards and the officers threw them out, and went into the inner room of the temple of Baal.","Lăp lu sư pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'buh pơkhôi đang bơih, Jêhu khan kơ lu linh gak păng lu yŏng tih linh: “Mơ̆t pơlôch lu sư bĕ, pơlôch pơđĭ, 'nĕ kơ ăn bu gơh lĕch.” Thoi noh na lu sư pơlôch lu đe ei hăm đao gưm, lu bơngai gak păng lu yŏng tih linh klơ̆m lê̆ atâu lu đe ei tơ 'nguaih, na mơ̆t lăm anih hnam yang Baal."
"And they brought the sacred pillars out of the temple of Baal and burned them.","Lu sư yuih lê̆ gơ'bang soi đơ̆ng lăm hnam yang Baal; na soh lê̆."
"Then they broke down the sacred pillar of Baal, and tore down the temple of Baal and made it a refuse dump to this day.","Teh pơchah lê̆ rup man yang Baal, hăm yuih lê̆ hnam sư, pơm kơ anih noh jing anih chă bơyơ̆ng 'bâu ôm, truh tơ dang ei"
"Thus Jehu destroyed Baal from Israel.","Jêhu pơrăm yang Baal pơtôch lê̆ đơ̆ng lu bơngai Isơrael."
"However Jehu did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin, that is, from the golden calves that were at Bethel and Dan.","Mă-lei, sư ưh kơ achăng lê̆ ôh tơdrong yoch Jêrôbôam, kon drŏ-nglo Nêbat noh bơih mă hlôi pơm kơ lu bơngai Isơrael pơm yoch.

"But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart; for he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam, who had made Israel sin.","Mă-lei Jêhu ưh kơchăng đĭ jơhngơ̆m pơm kiơ̆ tơdrong juăt Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael, sư ưh kơ weh achăng lê̆ đơ̆ng tơdrong yoch Jêrôbôam, bơngai mă pơhlŭ lu bơngai Isơrael pơm yoch."
"In those days the LORD began to cut off parts of Israel; and Hazael conquered them in all the territory of Israel","Kơplah noh sơ̆, Kră Yang pơm tơhiong pơoch lê̆ teh lăm char Isơrael, pơm kơ Hasael blah iŏk jei tơ jơ̆p-jang lăm char Isơrael."
"from the Jordan eastward: all the land of Gilead—Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh—from Aroer, which is by the River Arnon, including Gilead and Bashan.","Blah tơgar iŏk đĭ-đăng tơring đơ̆ng đak krong Jôrđăn dĭng truh tơ gah hơlĕch, đĭ dêh gah Gileat, teh khŭl bơngai Gat, Rubên, păng adrĕch Manase, đơ̆ng Pơlei Arôe, 'bơ̆t thong đak Arnôn truh tơ dêh Gileat păng dêh Basan."
"Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?","Dôm lu tơdrong jang Jêhu, tơdrong jang nai dơ̆ng, păng tơdrong nuih kơtang sư, đei đe chih lăm sơ̆p hla bơar tơdrong hơ'mon gah lu pơtao đe Isơrael."
"So Jehu rested with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria. Then Jehoahaz his son reigned in his place.","Sư lôch thoi tep hiôk kiơ̆ lu yă 'bok sư, đe 'bŭ sư tơ Pơlei Samari; Jêhôahas, kon drŏ-nglo sư, pơm pơtao pơtrơp đơ̆ng sư."
"And the period that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years.","Jêhu pơgơ̆r lu đe Isơrael đunh đei 'bar-jĭt tơhngam sơnăm tơ Pơlei Samari."
"When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal heirs.","Lăp yă Athalia, mĕ pơtao Ahasia 'bôh kon drŏ-nglo sư lôch bơih, sư iung blah hloi, pơlôch đĭ-đăng adrĕch pơtao."
"But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king’s sons who were being murdered; and they hid him and his nurse in the bedroom, from Athaliah, so that he was not killed.","Mă-lei Jêhôseba kon drŏ-kăn pơtao Jêhôram, sư noh mŏ Ahasia, rôp tơtông Jôas, kon drŏ-nglo Ahasia đơ̆ng lăm lu kon tơdăm pơtao mă yă Athalia wă pơlôch, đơ̆ng noh ôn lê̆ sư lăm anih tep, oei hăm yă mă rong sư păng ôn lê̆ sư wă kơ Athalia chă ưh kơ 'bôh; yua kơ thoi noh na đe huay kơ đei pơlôch sư."
"So he was hidden with her in the house of the LORD for six years, while Athaliah reigned over the land.","Sư oei hăm Jehôseba, ôn tơ hnam Kră Yang lăm tơdrâu sơnăm kơplah Athalia pơgơ̆r dêh char Juđa."
"In the seventh year Jehoiada sent and brought the captains of hundreds—of the bodyguards and the escorts—and brought them into the house of the LORD to him. And he made a covenant with them and took an oath from them in the house of the LORD, and showed them the king’s son.","Sơnăm mă tơpơh, 'bok soi Jêhôiada athei bơngai krao lu 'bok tih mă pơgơ̆r minh-hrĕng 'nu linh gah khŭl linh Karit păng lu linh mă kiơ̆ wei pơtao noh năm tơ sư lăm hnam akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang.

"Then he commanded them, saying, “This is what you shall do: one-third of you who come on duty on the Sabbath shall be keeping watch over the king’s house","Sư athei lu đe ei: “'Nâu tơdrong mă lu iĕm gô pơm; truh năr pơdơh Sa'bat, iŏk klah asong pơm pêng khŭl minh khŭl lu iĕm gô wei anih pơtao"
"one-third shall be at the gate of Sur, and one-third at the gate behind the escorts. You shall keep the watch of the house, lest it be broken down.","minh khŭl iĕm gô gak 'măng dur Sur, na minh khŭl iĕm gô gak 'bơ̆t 'măng jang tơ rŏng lu bơngai wei pơkao, hnam pơtao găn ưh kơ ăn bu mơ̆t lăm noh."
"The two contingents of you who go off duty on the Sabbath shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD for the king.","Đơ̆ng noh dơ̆ng, 'bar khŭl lăm lu iĕm, keh kơ gak năr pơdơh Sa'bat, gô gak wei pơtao, gak wei hnam akŭm Kră Yang."
"But you shall surround the king on all sides, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whoever comes within range, let him be put to death. You are to be with the king as he goes out and as he comes in.”","Lu iĕm gô wei tăp dăr kơ pơtao, rim 'nu iĕm athei chĕp khêl đao; bu mah mơ̆t lăm iĕm athei pơlôch sư hloi. “Mưh pơtao lĕch, mơ̆t, iĕm athei kiơ̆ sư.”"
"So the captains of the hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. Each of them took his men who were to be on duty on the Sabbath, with those who were going off duty on the Sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.","Lu 'bok yŏng mă wei minh-hrĕng 'nu linh, lu sư pơm kiơ̆ nơ̆r 'bok soi Jêhôiada athei.

"And the priest gave the captains of hundreds the spears and shields which had belonged to King David, that were in the temple of the LORD.","'Bok soi ei ăn kơ lu yŏng linh dôm lu đao hơlă păng khêl Đawit sơ̆, đơ̆ng lăm Hnam akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang."
"Then the escorts stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, all around the king, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, by the altar and the house.","Lu linh mă kiơ̆ wei pơtao noh, rim 'nu lu sư chĕp tơmam tơblah kơdih kơdih, lu sư pơrĕng tăp dăr wă wei pơtao, iŏk đơ̆ng gah gơal truh tơ yă-nơ̆m kơ Hnam akŭm ei tăp dăr kơ chơnang soi păng hnam akŭm."
"And he brought out the king’s son, put the crown on him, and gave him the Testimony; they made him king and anointed him, and they clapped their hands and said, “Long live the king!”","Jêhôiada chông hloi kon tơdăm pơtao noh lĕch, pơyơ̆l ăn kơ sư môk pơtao, păng ăn kơ sư sơ̆p hla bơar tơdrong juăt.

"Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the escorts and the people, she came to the people in the temple of the LORD.","Lăp yă Athalia kơtơ̆ng 'bơ̆r lu linh păng 'bơ̆r lu kon pơlei, na sư năm hloi tơ kon pơlei lăm Hnam akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang."
"When she looked, there was the king standing by a pillar according to custom; and the leaders and the trumpeters were by the king. All the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets. So Athaliah tore her clothes and cried out, “Treason! Treason!”","Yă ei lăng 'bôh pơtao dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anih kơjung kiơ̆ thoi tơdrong juăt kơ̆m giĕng hmă, đei lu yŏng linh păng đei lu bơngai hlôm tơgiĕp dơ̆ng jê̆ sư păng đĭ-đăng kon pơlei lăm dêh char sư hiôk chơt hlôm tơgiĕp ngăl.

"And Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the army, and said to them, “Take her outside under guard, and slay with the sword whoever follows her.” For the priest had said, “Do not let her be killed in the house of the LORD.”","'Bok soi Jêhôiada athei lu yŏng khŭl linh: “Dui tơlĕch yă âu đơ̆ng lăm linh noh bĕ dah bu kiơ̆ sư, bơ̆n athei pơlôch hăm đao gưm.” Yua kơ 'bok soi khan bơih: “'Nĕ kơ pơlôch sư lăm Hnam akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang.”"
"So they seized her; and she went by way of the horses’ entrance into the king’s house, and there she was killed.","Đe rôp chông yă ei tơ hnam pơtao sư kơplah sư oei rok trong năm mơ̆t tơ anih pơtao 'bơ̆t trong 'măng jang 'măn kơ aseh mơ̆t, na đe pơlôch sư tơ noh."
"Then Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD, the king, and the people, that they should be the LORD’s people, and also between the king and the people.","Jêhôiada pơjing tơdrong pơgơ̆p pơkă hơlam Kră Yang hăm pơtao păng kon pơlei wă kơ lu sư jing kon pơlei Kră Yang. Sư kư̆m pơjing tơdrong pơgơ̆p pơtao hăm kon pơlei mơ̆n."
"And all the people of the land went to the temple of Baal, and tore it down. They thoroughly broke in pieces its altars and images, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD.","Đĭ-đăng kon pơlei lăm dêh char sư năm tơ anih hnam yang Baal, na yuih pơrăm lê̆ đĭ, teh pơchah lê̆ chơnang soi păng pôlôch lê̆ Mathan 'bok soi gah yang Baal 'bơ̆t anăp, Đơ̆ng noh Jêhôiada athei bơngai gak wei Hnam Akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang."
"Then he took the captains of hundreds, the bodyguards, the escorts, and all the people of the land; and they brought the king down from the house of the LORD, and went by way of the gate of the escorts to the king’s house. Then he sat on the throne of the kings.","Sư chông lu yŏng linh mă wei minh-hrĕng 'nu lĭnh, khŭl linh Karit, lu linh mă wei pơtao, păng đĭ-đăng kon pơlei lăm dêh char ei; sư ba pơtao jur đơ̆ng Hnam Akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang năm tơ hnam pơtao trong 'măng jang mă lu linh gak hnam pơtao noh, Na pơtao Jôas hơ-oei hloi 'bơ̆t tang-dŏ pơtao."
"So all the people of the land rejoiced; and the city was quiet, for they had slain Athaliah with the sword in the king’s house.","Đĭ-đăng kon pơlei chơt hiôk ngăl, păng pơlei ei gơh hiôk hơđơ̆ng, đơ̆ng rŏng kơ đe pơlôch yă Athalia hăm đao gưm 'bơ̆t anih hnam pơtao."
"Jehoash was seven years old when he became king.","Jôas, sư 'nao tơpơh sơnăm kơplah sư tŏk pơm pơtao."
"In the seventh year of Jehu, Jehoash became king, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zibiah of Beersheba.","Sơnăm mă tơpơh, chăl Jêhu pơgơ̆r, Jôas tŏk pơm pơtao păng pơgơ̆r puăn-jĭt sơnăm lăm Pơlei Jêrusalem. Mĕ sư yă Sibia, Pơlei Bêrsêba."
"Jehoash did what was right in the sight of the LORD all the days in which Jehoiada the priest instructed him.","Jôas pơm 'lơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang đĭ chăl arih yua kơ 'bok soi Jêhôiada bơtho sư."
"But the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.","Mă-lei, sư ưh kơ hŭt lê̆ hnam kơkuh kơ yang pơm tơ anih kơjung, lu kon pơlei oei hơnơ̆ng kơ soi sơmah kơ yang păng soh tơ kơpal anih 'bâu phu kơjung noh."
"And Jehoash said to the priests, “All the money of the dedicated gifts that are brought into the house of the LORD—each man’s census money, each man’s assessment money—and all the money that a man purposes in his heart to bring into the house of the LORD","Jôas khan kơ lu 'bok soi: “Dôm jên tơmam 'lơ̆ng rơgoh đe juăt kơ ba 'măn tơ Hnam Akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang, mă jên thuê̆ đêl hơgăt kơ rim kơ̆l kon bơngai mă jên đơ̆ng rim 'nu đei pơyơ̆r lăm năr akŭm kiơ̆ kơ jơhngơ̆m hiôk"
"let the priests take it themselves, each from his constituency; and let them repair the damages of the temple, wherever any dilapidation is found.”","apinh lu 'bok soi, athei chă iŏk jên noh đơ̆ng lu bơngai mă pơyơ̆r, đơ̆ng noh yua jên ei hơmet ming hnam akŭm 'bơ̆t yơ mă pơchah tơphĕ.”"
"Now it was so, by the twenty-third year of King Jehoash, that the priests had not repaired the damages of the temple.","Mă-lei truh sơnăm mă 'bar-jĭt pêng, chăl Jôas pơgơ̆r, lu 'bok soi ưh kơ hơmet ming Hnam kư̆m dơ̆ng."
"So King Jehoash called Jehoiada the priest and the other priests, and said to them, “Why have you not repaired the damages of the temple? Now therefore, do not take more money from your constituency, but deliver it for repairing the damages of the temple.”","Na Jôas krao hloi 'bok soi Jêhôiada păng lu 'bok soi nai, na jet: “Liơ iĕm ưh kơ chă hơmet ming Hnam akŭm dơ̆ng?

"And the priests agreed that they would neither receive more money from the people, nor repair the damages of the temple.","Lu 'bok soi drơ̆ng ưh pă ra jên đơ̆ng kon pơlei bơih păng lu sư kư̆m drơ̆ng ưh pă drơ̆ng pŭ iŏk tơdrong jang wă hơmet ming Hnam akŭm bơih."
"Then Jehoiada the priest took a chest, bored a hole in its lid, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into the house of the LORD; and the priests who kept the door put there all the money brought into the house of the LORD.","'Bok soi Jêhôiada iŏk hloi minh pôm hom kuer bơlôh 'bơ̆t tơnglơ̆p sư, đơ̆ng noh dan 'bơ̆t jê̆ chơnang soi gah 'ma kơ 'măng mơ̆t lăm Hnam akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang Lu 'bok soi wei 'măng Hnam akŭm, tah lê̆ đĭ-đăng jên mă đơ̆ng đe pơyơ̆r lăm Hnam akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang, lăm hom ei ngăl."
"So it was, whenever they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king’s scribe and the high priest came up and put it in bags, and counted the money that was found in the house of the LORD.","Lăp 'bôh jên lăm hom ei lơ bơih, bơngai mă chih hla bơar lăm anih pơtao păng 'bok soi tơm năm iŏk, tơlĕch jên mă đei lăm hnam akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang na jô̆ păng tah chô̆ hơmet lê̆ lăm 'bi."
"Then they gave the money, which had been apportioned, into the hands of those who did the work, who had the oversight of the house of the LORD; and they paid it out to the carpenters and builders who worked on the house of the LORD","Đơ̆ng noh, bre sư jao jên mă đêl jô̆ bơih noh 'bơ̆t ti lu bơngai jang wei-lăng hiơ̆k bơngơ̆t gah tơdrong jang wă hơmet ming Hnam akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang.

"and to masons and stonecutters, and for buying timber and hewn stone, to repair the damage of the house of the LORD, and for all that was paid out to repair the temple.","apah lu thơ̆ man păng thơ̆ teh tơmo, lăm tơdrong jang hơmet Hnam akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang ngăl.

"However there were not made for the house of the LORD basins of silver, trimmers, sprinkling-bowls, trumpets, any articles of gold or articles of silver, from the money brought into the house of the LORD.","Mă-lei, đe ưh kơ yua jên mă pơyơ̆r ăn kơ Hnam akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang noh na răt tơmam yua lăm hnam akŭm thoi pơnhan hu, kơthao dah săng kăt brai ŭnh kơđeng, tơgiĕp, dah tơmam nai, pơm hăm maih dah hăm hu tah yua lăm hnam akŭm"
"But they gave that to the workmen, and they repaired the house of the LORD with it.","yua kơ đe ăn jên ei kơ lu bơngai jang tơdrong wă hơmet ming hnam akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang đĕch."
"Moreover they did not require an account from the men into whose hand they delivered the money to be paid to workmen, for they dealt faithfully.","Lu bơngai mă chĕp jên chă asong lu đe thơ̆ jang noh, đe ưh kơ athei sư chih jô̆ lăng yua kơ lu đe ei jang tơpăt tơnăp ngăl."
"The money from the trespass offerings and the money from the sin offerings was not brought into the house of the LORD. It belonged to the priests.","Jên gah tơmam soi huai iŏk tơdrong glăi, păng jên gah tơmam soi huai iŏk tơdrong yoch, đe ưh kơ chĕp tah tơmơ̆t lăm hnam akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang; jên ei 'măn kơ 'bok soi."
"Hazael king of Syria went up and fought against Gath, and took it; then Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.","Hơtai noh, Hasael pơtao đe Aram năm blah tơgar iŏk teh Pơlei Gat đơ̆ng noh sư kư̆m chĕp linh wă blah tơgar Pơlei Jêrusalem hai dơ̆ng."
"And Jehoash king of Judah took all the sacred things that his fathers, Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own sacred things, and all the gold found in the treasuries of the house of the LORD and in the king’s house, and sent them to Hazael king of Syria. Then he went away from Jerusalem.","Jôas, pơtao đe Juđa, iŏk đĭ dôm tơmam 'lơ̆ng rơgoh lu 'bok kơdră sư sơ̆ 'bok Jêhôsaphat, Jêhôram, păng Ahasia, lu sư noh pơtao đe Juđa, tơmam noh lu sư hlôi 'măn lê̆ 'lơ̆ng rơgoh, Jôas kư̆m iŏk tơmam 'lơ̆ng rơgoh sư kơdih păng iŏk đĭ maih lăm hnam mong tơmam lăm hnam akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang păng đơ̆ng hnam pơtao, na pơyơ̆r ăn kơ Hasael pơtao đe Aram, yua kơ tơdrong noh, na Hasael chu weh đơ̆ng Pơlei Jêrusalem."

"For Jozachar the son of Shimeath and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, struck him. So he died, and they buried him with his fathers in the City of David. Then Amaziah his son reigned in his place.","Jôsaka, kon drŏ-nglo Simêat păng Jêhôsabat, kon drŏ-nglo Sômer, bre sư noh đĭch đam Jôas, bre sư pơlôch Jôas.

"And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin.

"So Jehoahaz pleaded with the LORD, and the LORD listened to him; for He saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed them.","Jêhôahas krao apinh Kră Yang na Kră Yang mơ̆ng nơ̆r sư; yua kơ Kră Yang 'bôh pơtao đe Aram pơgŏ pơđep kon Pơlei Isơrael dêh."
"Then the LORD gave Israel a deliverer, so that they escaped from under the hand of the Syrians; and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents as before.","Kră Yang ăn kơ Isơrael minh 'nu bơngai dŏng pơklaih lu sư, kon pơlei Isơrael klaih đơ̆ng ti lu đe Aram păng gơh oei lăm anih hnam lu sư kơdih thoi adrol sơ̆ dơ̆ng"
"Nevertheless they did not depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who had made Israel sin, but walked in them; and the wooden image also remained in Samaria.","Mă-lei, lu sư kuă kơ achăng lê̆ ôh tơdrong yoch Jêrôbôam, tơdrong mă pơtao noh hlôi pơm bơih kơ đe Isơrael pơm yoch; lu sư oei hơnơ̆ng kơ pơm yoch đĕch; dĭng mah rup man yang Asêra oei pơdơ̆ng lê̆ dơ'nhơ̆ng lăm pơlei Samari."
"For He left of the army of Jehoahaz only fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand foot soldiers; for the king of Syria had destroyed them and made them like the dust at threshing.","Lăm đĭ-đăng khŭl linh Jêhôahas, Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei oei lê̆ lăi lăp pơđăm-jĭt 'nu linh hao aseh păng mơjĭt tŏ gre aseh tơblah păng mơjĭt-rơbâu 'nu linh yak jơ̆ng, yua kơ pơtao đe Aram đei pơrăm lu linh đe Isơrael păng juă bơhlơ̆r lu sư, nhen thoi teh rơpŭk tơ anih đe pơjuă 'ba."

"So Joash rested with his fathers. Then Jeroboam sat on his throne. And Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.","Jêhôas lôch thoi tep hiôk hăm lu 'bok kơdră sư sơ̆, đơ̆ng noh Jêrôbôam pơgơ̆r pơtrơp đêl sư. Jêhôas đe 'bŭ sư tơ Pơlei Samari hơdai hăm lu pơtao đe Isơrael."
"Elisha had become sick with the illness of which he would die. Then Joash the king of Israel came down to him, and wept over his face, and said, “O my father, my father, the chariots of Israel and their horsemen!”","Êlisê jĭ, yua kơ jĭ 'noh na sư lôch, Jêhôas, pơtao đe Isơrael năm lăng sư kơplah sư oei jĭ, nhơ̆m 'bơ̆t anăp sư păng khan: “Ơ 'bă inh ơi!

"And Elisha said to him, “Take a bow and some arrows.” So he took himself a bow and some arrows.","Na Êlisê khan kơ sư: “Iŏk hră hăm 'brơ̆m bĕ” Jêhôas iŏk hĭ hră hăm 'brơ̆m."
"Then he said to the king of Israel, “Put your hand on the bow.” So he put his hand on it, and Elisha put his hands on the king’s hands.","Êlisê khan dơ̆ng kơ pơtao Isơrael: “Gŭt bĕ hră ih.” Na pơtao gŭt hĭ hră hloi. Đơ̆ng noh Êlisê dan ti sư kơpal ti pơtao ei"
"And he said, “Open the east window”; and he opened it. Then Elisha said, “Shoot”; and he shot. And he said, “The arrow of the LORD’s deliverance and the arrow of deliverance from Syria; for you must strike the Syrians at Aphek till you have destroyed them.”","na khan: “Pơih 'măng-'mŏk gah hơlĕch bĕ.” Na Jêhôas pơih hĭ 'măng.

"Then he said, “Take the arrows”; so he took them. And he said to the king of Israel, “Strike the ground”; so he struck three times, and stopped.","Êlisê khan dơ̆ng: “Iŏk minh hơchô̆ 'brơ̆m bĕ!” Na Jêhôas iŏk 'brơ̆m. Êlisê khan dơ̆ng: “Huăt bĕ 'brơ̆m tơ teh.” Jêhôas huăt tơ teh pêng wơ̆t, đơ̆ng noh pơdơh."
"And the man of God was angry with him, and said, “You should have struck five or six times; then you would have struck Syria till you had destroyed it! But now you will strike Syria only three times.”","Êlisê bơngai mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua noh hil kơ sư, khan kơ pơtao: “Dah ih huăt pơđăm tơdrâu wơ̆t, lei ih blah char Aram dĭng răm đĭ; mă-lei 'nâu ih gô blah lu bơngai char Aram lăp pêng wơ̆t đĕch.”"
"Then Elisha died, and they buried him. And the raiding bands from Moab invaded the land in the spring of the year.","Na Êlisê lôch, đe 'bŭ sư. Lăm char noh truh lăm sơnăm 'nao đei khŭl linh đe Môap ngăl mơ̆t wă blah dêh char sư."
"So it was, as they were burying a man, that suddenly they spied a band of raiders; and they put the man in the tomb of Elisha; and when the man was let down and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived and stood on his feet.","Kơplah, đe năm 'bŭ minh 'nu bơngai lôch, 'bôh khŭl linh ei wă tơblah, na lu sư atat lê̆ atâu ei lăm bơsat Êlisê na kơdâu ôn.

"And Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.","Hasael, pơtao đe Aram pơgŏ pơđep lu đe Isơrael dĭng truh đĭ chăl Jêhôahas pơgơ̆r."
"But the LORD was gracious to them, had compassion on them, and regarded them, because of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not yet destroy them or cast them from His presence.","Mă-lei Kră Yang mơnat tơgŭm wei-lăng lu sư yua kơ Sư pơkă bơih hăm Abraham, Isăk păng Jakôp.

"Now Hazael king of Syria died. Then Ben-Hadad his son reigned in his place.","Lăp Hasael, pơtao đe Aram lôch. Ben Hadat, kon drŏ-nglo sư, pơgơ̆r pơtrơp đêl sư."
"And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz recaptured from the hand of Ben-Hadad, the son of Hazael, the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times Joash defeated him and recaptured the cities of Israel.","Jêhôas kon drŏ-nglo Jêhôahas iŏk lê̆ dơ̆ng đơ̆ng Ben Hadat, kon drŏ-nglo Hasael, sư iŏk lê̆ lu pơlei mă Ben Hadat iŏk bơih đơ̆ng Jêhôahas, 'bă sư.

"In the second year of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel, Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, became king.","Lăm sơnăm mă 'bar, chăl Jêhôas, kon drŏ-nglo Jêhôahas, pơtao đe Isơrael pơgơ̆r, na Amasia, kon drŏ-nglo Jôas pơtao đe Juđa, tŏk pơm pơtao."
"He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.","Kơplah sư tŏk pơm pơtao sư 'nao 'bar-jĭt pơđăm sơnăm păng sư pơgơ̆r 'bar-jĭt tơsĭn sơnăm lăm pơlei Jêrusalem, mĕ sư anăn Jêhôadin, bơngai Pơlei Jêrusalem."
"And he did what was right in the sight of the LORD, yet not like his father David; he did everything as his father Joash had done.","Sư pơm 'lơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, mă-lei sư ưh kơ thoi Đawit, 'bok kơdră sư sơ̆; sư pơm tơdrong rok thoi Jôas 'bă sư đei pơm."
"However the high places were not taken away, and the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.","Mă-lei, sư ưh kơ teng hŭt lê̆ hnam kơkuh kơ yang tơ anih kơjung, kon pơlei oei nŏng kơ soi sơmah păng soh 'long 'bâu phu 'bơ̆t hnam kơkuh kơ yang tơ anih kơjung ei đĕch."
"Now it happened, as soon as the kingdom was established in his hand, that he executed his servants who had murdered his father the king.","Lăp dêh char sư pơgơ̆r pran kơjăp bơih, na sư pơlôch lu đĭch đam mă hlôi pơlôch 'bă sư sơ̆."
"But the children of the murderers he did not execute, according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, in which the LORD commanded, saying, “Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor shall children be put to death for their fathers; but a person shall be put to death for his own sin.”","Mă-lei sư ưh kơ pơlôch ôh lu kon, bơngai pơlôch đe noh, kiơ̆ thoi nơ̆r mă đe đei chih bơih tơ lăm sơ̆p hla bơar tơdrong juăt Môis: “Lăm tơdrong Kră Yang đei tơtă bơih, đe ưh kơ pơlôch mĕ 'bă yua kơ kon yoch, kư̆m ưh kơ pơlôch kon yua kơ mĕ 'bă pơm yoch; rim 'nu đe gô pơlôch yua kơ tơdrong yoch sư kơdih."
"He killed ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt, and took Sela by war, and called its name Joktheel to this day.","Amasia pơlôch mơjĭt-rơbâu 'nu linh Eđôm tơ lăm thong 'Boh, blah iŏk pơlei Sêla păng đe krao pơlei noh anăn Jôktheel truh tơ dang ei."
"Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come, let us face one another in battle.”","Thoi noh Amasia wơh bơngai năm tơ Jêhôas, kon drŏ-nglo Jêhôahas, sâu Jêhu, pơtao đe Isơrael, na khan: “Năm tơ âu, bơ̆n tơblah băl lăng.”"
"And Jehoash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, “The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son as wife’; and a wild beast that was in Lebanon passed by and trampled the thistle.","Jêhôas pơtao đe Isơrael wơh bơngai pơtruh nơ̆r kơ Amasia pơtao đe Juđa: “'Long jơla lăm char Liban wơh athei năm pơtruh nơ̆r kơ 'long hơngo lăm bri Liban thoi âu: Ăn kon adruh ih pơm akăn kon tơdăm inh.

"You have indeed defeated Edom, and your heart has lifted you up. Glory in that, and stay at home; for why should you meddle with trouble so that you fall—you and Judah with you?”","Ih blah bơih adrĕch lu đe Eđôm jei ih păng jơhngơ̆m 'bĕnh kơ tơdrong pơang.

"But Amaziah would not heed. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went out; so he and Amaziah king of Judah faced one another at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah.","Mă-lei Amasia ưh kơ 'maih mơ̆ng, thoi noh Jêhôas pơtao đe Isơrael năm hloi, đơ̆ng noh bre sư Amasia, pơtao Juđa tơblah băl tơ Bêt Sêmes lăm char Juđa."
"And Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man fled to his tent.","Linh đe Isơrael blah lê̆ lu đe Juđa thuơ, rim 'nu lu sư kơdâu ôn, brŏk tơ anih hnam lu sư kơdih."
"Then Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash, the son of Ahaziah, at Beth Shemesh; and he went to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate—four hundred cubits.","Tơ Bêt Sêmes, Jêhôas pơtao đe Isơrael rôp arih Amasia pơtao đe Juđa kon drŏ-nglo Jôas, sâu Ahasia; đơ̆ng noh năm tơ Pơlei Jêrusalem teng pơchah lê̆ dur Jêrusalem đơ̆ng 'măng jang Êphraim truh tơ 'măng jang Mum, ataih kơjung sư truh tơ 'bar-hrĕng hlok."
"And he took all the gold and silver, all the articles that were found in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the king’s house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.","Sư iŏk lu maih, hu, pơnhan păng dôm tơmam yua lăm Hnam akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang păng dôm lu tơmam gĭt lăm hnam pơtao; sư kư̆m rôp pơgơ̆t lê̆ bơngai đơ̆ng lăm ei pơm bơnă, đơ̆ng noh weh brŏk tơ Pơlei Samari."
"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did—his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah—are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?","Dôm lu tơdrong roi hơ'mon nai gah Jêhôas, dôm tơdrong jang đêl sư pơm tơdrong nuih kơtang sư, tơdrong sư tơblah hăm Amasia pơtao đe Juđa, đe đei chih lê̆ boih tơ lăm sơ̆p hla bơar hơ'mon gah lu pơtao Isơrael"
"So Jehoash rested with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. Then Jeroboam his son reigned in his place.","Jêhôas lôch thoi tep hăm 'bok kơdră sư sơ̆, păng đe 'bŭ sư tơ Pơlei Samari hơdai hăm lu pơtao đe Isơrael; đơ̆ng noh, Jêrôbôam, kon drŏ-nglo sư tŏk pơm pơtao pơtrơp đơ̆ng sư."
"Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel.","Amasia, kon drŏ-nglo Jôas; pơtao đe Juđa oei arih mơjĭt-pơđăm sơnăm dơ̆ng đơ̆ng rŏng kơ Jêhôas kon drŏ-nglo Jêhôahas pơtao đe Isơrael lôch 'noh."

"And they formed a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there.","Tơ Pơlei Jêrusalem đei bơngai chă đon wă blah pơtao Amasia. Na sư kơdâu ôn tơ Lakis. Mă-lei đe athei bơngai druh 'moi rôp sư tơ Lakis păng pơlôch sư tơ noh."

"And all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.","Đĭ-đăng kon Pơlei Juđa iŏk Asaria 'nao mơjĭt-tơdrâu sơnăm pôk pơm pơtao pơtrơp kơ Amasia, 'bă sư."
"He built Elath and restored it to Judah, after the king rested with his fathers.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ 'bă sư Amasia lôch thoi tep hiôk hăm lu 'bok kơdră sư bơih, na Asaria pơjing pơlei Êlat păng pơđâu iŏk pơlei ei tơwih ăn kơ đe Juđa pơm tơ'ngla pơgơ̆r."
"In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel, became king in Samaria, and reigned forty-one years.","Sơnăm mă mơjĭt-pơđăm, chăl Amasia kon drŏ-nglo Jôas, pơtao đe Juđa pơgơ̆r, Jêrôbôam kon drŏ-nglo Jêhôas tŏk pơm pơtao đe Isơrael tơ pơlei Samari.

"And he did evil in the sight of the LORD; he did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin.","Sư pơm kơnê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, sư ưh kơ achăng lê̆ ôh tơdrong yoch Jêrôbôam kon drŏ-nglo Nêbat pơm kơ Isơrael pơm yoch."
"He restored the territory of Israel from the entrance of Hamath to the Sea of the Arabah, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which He had spoken through His servant Jonah the son of Amittai, the prophet who was from Gath Hepher.","Sư pơdrâu iŏk đơ̆ng hơdral dêh char Isơrael đơ̆ng 'bơ̆t trong mơ̆t tơ Pơlei Libo Hamat truh tơ đak Dơsĭ Araba, kiơ̆ thoi nơ̆r Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei đe Isơrael khan kơ Jôna đĭch đam Sư kon drŏ-nglo Amitai 'bok khan lê̆ adrol mă oei tơ Pơlei Gat Hepher."
"For the LORD saw that the affliction of Israel was very bitter; and whether bond or free, there was no helper for Israel.","Yua kơ Kră Yang 'bôh bơih lu bơngai Isơrael đei tơdrong pơmat-tat ơh sơ'ngon dêh, lăm Isơrael mă bơngai rơngei, dah đĭch pă đei bu dŏng tơgŭm."
"And the LORD did not say that He would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven; but He saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.","Lei na Kră Yang Sư ưh kơ đei khan wă sut lê̆ anăn Isơrael đơ̆ng lăm teh âu, thoi noh sư yua hloi ti Jêrôbôam kon drŏ-nglo Jêhôas dŏng pơklaih lu sư."
"Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did—his might, how he made war, and how he recaptured for Israel, from Damascus and Hamath, what had belonged to Judah—are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?","Lu tơdrong roi hơ'mon nai gah Jêrôbôam, lu tơdrong đêl sư pơm, tơdrong nuih kơtang sư, tơdrong sư tơblah păng pơdrâu iŏk dơ̆ng ăn kơ lu bơngai Isơrael Pơlei Đamas păng Hamat sơ̆ ki đêl Juđa iŏk, dôm tơdrong 'nei đe đei chih tơ lăm sơ̆p hla bơar hơ'mon gah lu pơtao đe Isơrael?"

"Then the LORD struck the king, so that he was a leper until the day of his death; so he dwelt in an isolated house. And Jotham the king’s son was over the royal house, judging the people of the land.","Kră Yang phak pơtao Amasia, pơm kơ sư jĭ chin dĭng truh tơ năr sư lôch, kơplah sư oei arih, sư oei tơ ataih kơ kon pơlei pơm hnam hơdrô̆ sư.

"So Menahem rested with his fathers. Then Pekahiah his son reigned in his place.","Mênahem lôch thoi tep hiôk hăm lu 'bok kơdră sư. Na Pêkahia, kon drŏ-nglo sư, tŏk pơm pơtao pơgơ̆r pơtrơp sư."
"In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekahiah the son of Menahem became king over Israel in Samaria, and reigned two years.","Lăm sơnăm mă pơđăm-jĭt chăl Asaria pơm pơtao đe Juđa, Pêkahia kon drŏ-nglo Mênahem tŏk pơm pơtao pơgơ̆r đe Isơrael lăm Pơlei Samari, sư pơgơ̆r lăm 'bar sơnăm."
"And he did evil in the sight of the LORD; he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin.","Sư pơm kơnê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, sư ưh kơ achăng lê̆ ôh tơdrong yoch Jêrôbôam kon drŏ-nglo Nêbat, noh tơdrong yoch mă pơm ăn kơ Isơrael pơm yoch."
"Then Pekah the son of Remaliah, an officer of his, conspired against him and killed him in Samaria, in the citadel of the king’s house, along with Argob and Arieh; and with him were fifty men of Gilead. He killed him and reigned in his place.","Pêka kon drŏ-nglo Rêmalia, yŏng linh pơtao, chă đon wă pơm kơnê̆ kơ sư, hơdai hăm pơđăm-jĭt 'nu đơ̆ng tơring Gileat, blah kơđông kơjăp tơ Pơlei Samari, pơlôch sư hơdai hăm Argôp, Arie na sư tŏk pơm pơtao tơplih Pêkahia."
"Now the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did, indeed they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.","Lu tơdrong jang Pêkahia păng dôm tơdrong jang sư mă pơm boih, đei chih ngăl boih tơ lăm sơ̆p hla bơar tơdrong hơ'mon gah lu pơtao đe Isơrael."
"In the fifty-second year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekah the son of Remaliah became king over Israel in Samaria, and reigned twenty years.","Lăm sơnăm mă pơđăm-jĭt 'bar, chăl Asaria, pơtao đe Juđa pơgơ̆r, na Pêka, kon drŏ-nglo Rêmalia, tŏk pơm pơtao đe Isơrael lăm Pơlei Samari păng sư pơgơ̆r 'bar-jĭt sơnăm."
"And he did evil in the sight of the LORD; he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin.","Sư pơm kơnê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, sư ưh kơ achăng lê̆ tơdrong yoch Jêrôbôam, kon drŏ-nglo Nêbat, noh tơdrong yoch mă đei pơm kơ lu bơngai Isơrael pơm yoch."
"In the days of Pekah king of Israel, Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria came and took Ijon, Abel Beth Maachah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali; and he carried them captive to Assyria.","Lăm chăl Pêka, pơm pơtao đe Isơrael, Tiglat Pileser, pơtao đe Asiri năm tơgar iŏk pơlei Ijôn, Abel Bêt Maaka, Janôa, Kêđes, Hasor, tơring Gileat tơring Galilê păng tơring Naptali hai dơ̆ng.

"Then Hoshea the son of Elah led a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and struck and killed him; so he reigned in his place in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.","Hôsêa kon drŏ-nglo Êlah, chă đon blah Pêka, kon drŏ-nglo Rêmalia păng pơlôch sư đơ̆ng noh tŏk pơm pơtao tơplih sư.

"Now the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, indeed they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.","Dôm lu tơdrong hơ'mon nai gah Pêka, đĭ-đăng lu tơdrong jang sư pơm, đei chih ngăl boih lăm sơ̆p hla bơar hơ'mon gah lu pơtao đe Isơrael."
"In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, Jotham the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, began to reign.","Lăm sơnăm mă 'bar chăl Pêka, kon drŏ-nglo Rêmalia, pơtao đe Isơrael, na Jôtham kon drŏ-nglo Ussia, pơtao đe Juđa, tŏk pơm pơtao."
"He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok.","Kơplah sư tŏk pơm pơtao, sư 'nao 'bar-jĭt pơđăm sơnăm, sư pơgơ̆r mơjĭt-tơdrâu sơnăm lăm Pơlei Jêrusalem. Mĕ sư anăn Jêrusa kon drŏ-kăn Sađŏk."
"And he did what was right in the sight of the LORD; he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done.","Sư pơm 'lơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, sư pơm dôm tơdrong 'bă sư Ussia hlôi pơm bơih."
"However the high places were not removed; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places. He built the Upper Gate of the house of the LORD.","Mă-lei, sư ưh kơ yuih lê̆ hnam kơkuh kơ yang đe pơm tơ anih kơjung, kon pơlei oei nŏng soi sơmah păng soh 'long 'bâu phu tơ noh.

"Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?","Dôm lu tơdrong hơ'mon nai gah Jôtham păng đĭ-đăng tơdrong jang sư pơm đe chih lê̆ boih tơ lăm sơ̆p hla bơar hơ'mon gah lu pơtao đe Juđa."
"In those days the LORD began to send Rezin king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah against Judah.","Kơplah noh, Kră Yang ăn kơ Rêsin, pơtao Aram păng Pêka, kon drŏ-nglo Rêmalia, năm wang blah Juđa."
"So Jotham rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David his father. Then Ahaz his son reigned in his place.","Jôtham lôch thoi tep hiôk hăm lu 'bok kơdră sư sơ̆, đe 'bŭ sư jê̆ lu 'bok kơdră sư, tơ Pơlei Đawit. Ahas, kon drŏ-nglo sư, tŏk pơm pơtao pơgơ̆r pơtrơp sư."
"In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah, Ahaz the son of Jotham, king of Judah, began to reign.","Lăm sơnăm mă mơjĭt-tơpơh, chăl Pêka, kon drŏ-nglo Rêmalia pơgơ̆r, na Ahas, kon drŏ-nglo Jôtham, tŏk pơm pơtao đe Juđa."
"Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and he did not do what was right in the sight of the LORD his God, as his father David had done.","Ahas sư 'nao 'bar-jĭt sơnăm kơplah sư tŏk pơm pơtao; sư pơgơ̆r mơjĭt-tơdrâu sơnăm tơ Pơlei Jêrusalem.

"But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel; indeed he made his son pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD had cast out from before the children of Israel.","Mă-lei sư năm kiơ̆ trong lu pơtao đe Isơrael, sư pơyơ̆r kon drŏ-nglo sư pơm tơmam soi 'buh pơkhôi, pơm tơdrong kơnê̆ 'mê̆-'mach thoi lu adrĕch adrung nai đei pơm, mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei puh lê̆ lu sư đơ̆ng lu bơngai Isơrael."
"And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.","Sư kư̆m soi sơmah păng soh 'long 'bâu phu tơ lu anih kơkuh kơ yang đe pơm tơ kơpal groi păng ala tơnơm 'long kơdrơ̆ng."
"Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, came up to Jerusalem to make war; and they besieged Ahaz but could not overcome him.","Kơplah ei, Rêsin, pơtao đe Aram păng Pêka, kon drŏ-nglo Ramalia, pơtao đe Isơrael bre sư năm, wă tơblah hăm Pơlei Jêrusalem; lu sư bơwang Ahas, mă-lei lu sư ưh kơ kĕ kơ pơtao ei."
"At that time Rezin king of Syria captured Elath for Syria, and drove the men of Judah from Elath. Then the Edomites went to Elath, and dwell there to this day.","'Blep kơplah noh, pơtao đe Eđôm blah iŏk Pơlei Êlat pơdrâu kơ Eđôm; sư blah puh lê̆ lu bơngai Juđa đơ̆ng pơlei Êlat, na lu bơngai Eđôm năm tơ Pơlei Êlat, oei hloi tơ noh dĭng truh dang ei."
"So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria, saying, “I am your servant and your son. Come up and save me from the hand of the king of Syria and from the hand of the king of Israel, who rise up against me.”","Ahas wơh bơngai năm tơ Tiglat Pilêser, pơtao đe Asiri, sư khan: “Inh âu bơngai đam ih, kon drŏ-nglo ih; apinh ih dŏng pơklaih inh đơ̆ng tơpang ti pơtao đe Aram păng pơtao đe Isơrael blah inh.”"
"And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasuries of the king’s house, and sent it as a present to the king of Assyria.","Ahas kư̆m iŏk hu, maih đơ̆ng lăm Hnam akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang păng đơ̆ng lăm hnam mong tơmam lăm hnam pơtao, chĕp ba tơmam noh ăn kơ pơtao đe Asiri."
"So the king of Assyria heeded him; for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus and took it, carried its people captive to Kir, and killed Rezin.","Pơtao đe Asiri drơ̆ng iŏk nơ̆r Ahas apinh, sư năm blah Pơlei Đamas păng tơgar iŏk pơlei 'noh, rôp ba kon pơlei sư pơm bơnă tơ Pơlei Kir păng pơlôch lê̆ pơtao Rêsin."
"Now King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus; and King Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the design of the altar and its pattern, according to all its workmanship.","Na Ahas năm tơ pơlei Đamas wă sơng Tiglat Pilêser pơtao đe Asiri.

"Then Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus. So Urijah the priest made it before King Ahaz came back from Damascus.","Uria pơm minh pôm chơnang soi rok thoi đêl đe pơm, mă pơtao Ahas đơ̆ng pơlei Đamas hlôi gơih ăn kơ sư noh; Uria pơm keh chơnang soi ei adrol kơ pơtao brŏk."
"And when the king came back from Damascus, the king saw the altar; and the king approached the altar and made offerings on it.","Lăp pơtao brŏk đơ̆ng Pơlei Đamas, 'bôh chơnang soi, na sư tơkan năm jê̆ păng pơyơ̆r tơmam soi kơpal chơnang soi ei."
"So he burned his burnt offering and his grain offering; and he poured his drink offering and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings on the altar.","Sư soh pơyơ̆r kơpal chơnang soi ei tơmam soi 'buh pơkhôi păng tơmam soi phe 'ba, tuh tơmam soi huch sa păng tơtreh pham tơmam soi bơnê kơpal chơnang soi."
"He also brought the bronze altar which was before the LORD, from the front of the temple—from between the new altar and the house of the LORD—and put it on the north side of the new altar.","Chơnang soi đe pơm păng kong dan 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, sư iŏk lê̆ đơ̆ng anih mă đe dan chơnang soi ei 'bơ̆t 'măng Hnam akŭm, sơlam chơnang soi 'nao hăm hnam Kră Yang, đơ̆ng noh iŏk dan tơ gah yă-nơ̆m kơ chơnang soi sư 'nao pơm."
"Then King Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, “On the great new altar burn the morning burnt offering, the evening grain offering, the king’s burnt sacrifice, and his grain offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, their grain offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle on it all the blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the sacrifice. And the bronze altar shall be for me to inquire by.”","Đơ̆ng noh, pơtao Ahas athei 'bok soi Uria khan: “Ih gô soh kơpal chơnang soi tih 'nâu tơmam soi 'buh pơkhôi rim pơgê păng tơmam soi phe 'ba tơ gơsơ̆ păng tơmam soi 'buh tơmam soi phe 'ba đơ̆ng pơtao 'mơ̆i păng tơmam soi 'buh đơ̆ng đĭ kon pơlei lăm char păng tơmam soi lu sư pơyơ̆r phe 'ba păng tơmam soi et huch Ih athei tơtreh pham lu tơmam soi 'buh kơpal chơnang tih noh.

"Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that King Ahaz commanded.","'Bok soi Uria pơm kiơ̆ dôm tơdrong đêl pơtao Ahas bơtho sư."
"And King Ahaz cut off the panels of the carts, and removed the lavers from them; and he took down the Sea from the bronze oxen that were under it, and put it on a pavement of stones.","Đơ̆ng noh, pơtao Ahas teng yuih lê̆ lu gre pơm păng kong păng hŭt lê̆ lu kơthŭng đak đêl dan kơpal gre ei păng iŏk tơjur lê̆ bơng đak đơ̆ng kơdŭ rơmo đe pơm păng kong, na lê̆ sư 'bơ̆t hơnơ̆l tơmo."
"Also he removed the Sabbath pavilion which they had built in the temple, and he removed the king’s outer entrance from the house of the LORD, on account of the king of Assyria.","Yua kơ sư wă kơ lăp đon pơtao đe Asiri, na sư kư̆m teng yuih lê̆ khăn dăng kuă kơ tŏ kơ trong đơ̆ng Hnam akŭm truh tơ 'măng dur, 'măn ăn kơ pơtao năm lăm năr pơdơh Sa'bat."
"Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?","Dôm lu tơdrong roi hơ'mon nai gah Ahas, păng đĭ-đăng tơdrong jang đêl sư pơm, đe đei chih lê̆ tơ lăm sơ̆p hla bơar hơ'mon roi gah lu pơtao đe Juđa."
"So Ahaz rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David. Then Hezekiah his son reigned in his place.","Đơ̆ng noh, Ahas lôch thoi tep hiôk hăm lu 'bok kơdră sư sơ̆, đe 'bŭ sư jê̆ lu 'bok kơdră sư tơ Pơlei Đawit.

"In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, Hoshea the son of Elah became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned nine years.","Lăm sơnăm mă mơjĭt-'bar, chăl Ahas, pơtao đe Juđa pơgơ̆r, na Hôsêa kon drŏ-nglo Êlah, tŏk pơm pơtao đe Isơrael, lăm Pơlei Samari; sư pơgơ̆r tơsĭn sơnăm."
"And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, but not as the kings of Israel who were before him.","Sư pơm kơnê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, mă-lei ưh kơ dang lu pơtao đe Isơrael adrol kơ sư ôh."
"Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against him; and Hoshea became his vassal, and paid him tribute money.","Salmaneser, pơtao đe Asiri năm blah pơtao Hôsêa, Hôsêa jing pơtao bơ̆jang kơ Salmaneser păng chu kiơ̆, ra ăn kơ Salmanese jên."
"And the king of Assyria uncovered a conspiracy by Hoshea; for he had sent messengers to So, king of Egypt, and brought no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year. Therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.","Mă-lei pơtao đe Asiri 'bôh Hôsêa chă đon wă blơ̆ sư; yua kơ Hôsêa đei wơh bơngai năm tơ Sô, pơtao đe Êyiptơ, păng sư kuă kơ ra ăn kơ pơtao đe Asiri thoi juăt ăn rim sơnăm; na pơtao đe Asiri rôp sư, tah sư tơ lăm hnam phak."
"Now the king of Assyria went throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria and besieged it for three years.","Đơ̆ng noh pơtao đe Asiri mơ̆t blah pơrăm jơ̆p-jang dêh char sư, wang Pơlei Samari lăm pêng sơnăm."
"In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria took Samaria and carried Israel away to Assyria, and placed them in Halah and by the Habor, the River of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.","Lăm sơnăm mă tơsĭn, chăl Hôsêa; pơtao đe Asiri blah iŏk Pơlei Samari, chông ba kon pơlei Isơrael tơ char Asiri, ăn lu sư oei 'bơ̆t Pơlei Hala păng 'bơ̆t đak krong Habôr tơ char Gôsan păng oei tơ lơ lu pơlei lăm dêh char Mêđi."
"For so it was that the children of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and they had feared other gods","Tơdrong 'nâu truh yua kơ kon pơlei Isơrael đei pơm yoch boih hăm Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu sư, Tơ'ngla mă hlôi dui iŏk lu sư lĕch đơ̆ng dêh Êyiptơ; păng đơ̆ng pơtao Pharaôn pơtao đe Êyiptơ pơgŏ pơđep lu sư.

"and had walked in the statutes of the nations whom the LORD had cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they had made.","yak kiơ̆ tơdrong juăt lu adrĕch adrung mă Kră Yang hlôi puh tơweh lu sư đơ̆ng anăp lu bơngai Isơrael păng yak kiơ̆ tơdrong juăt mă lu pơtao đe Isơrael hơmet bơih."
"Also the children of Israel secretly did against the LORD their God things that were not right, and they built for themselves high places in all their cities, from watchtower to fortified city.","Kon pơlei Isơrael oei ôn klĕnh pơm dôm lu tơdrong ưh kơ trŏ tơplơ̆ hăm Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu sư, pơdơ̆ng pơjing lu anih kơjung kơkuh kơ lu yang nai lăm jơ̆p kơ pơlei lu sư, đơ̆ng pơlei iĕ truh kơ pơlei tih kơjăp."
"They set up for themselves sacred pillars and wooden images on every high hill and under every green tree.","Lu sư pơdơ̆ng kơdih lu gơ̆ng tơmo păng kơkuh kơ rup yang Asêra kơpal kông groi păng ala tơm 'long kơdrơ̆ng."
"There they burned incense on all the high places, like the nations whom the LORD had carried away before them; and they did wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger","Tơ noh lu sư soh pơyơ̆r tơmam soi kơpal kông, thoi lu adrĕch adrung mă Kră Yang đei puh tơweh boih đơ̆ng lu sư; lu sư pơm kơnê̆ păng tơblĕk Kră Yang."
"for they served idols, of which the LORD had said to them, “You shall not do this thing.”","Lu sư kơkuh kơ lu rup yang mă Kră Yang khă bơih lu sư: “Lu iĕm 'nĕ kơkuh kơ lu sư.”"
"Yet the LORD testified against Israel and against Judah, by all of His prophets, every seer, saying, “Turn from your evil ways, and keep My commandments and My statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by My servants the prophets.”","Mă-lei Kră Yang yua 'bơ̆r lu bơngai khan lê̆ adrol păng băt lê̆ adrol na lu sư bơtho khan kơ lu bơngai Isơrael păng lu bơngai Juđa băt: “Weh bĕ đơ̆ng trong kơnê̆ lu iĕm, athei wei răk nơ̆r Inh tơtă, păng wei răk tơdrong juăt Inh, kiơ̆ thoi dôm tơdrong juăt Inh tơtă mă Inh yua bơih 'bơ̆r lu bơngai khan lê̆ adrol bơngai đĭch đam Inh na bơtho kơ lu yă 'bok lu iĕm.”"
"Nevertheless they would not hear, but stiffened their necks, like the necks of their fathers, who did not believe in the LORD their God.","Mă-lei lu sư arăng kơ̆l ưh kơ wă mơ̆ng, lei-lăi thoi lu yă 'bok lu sư ưh kơ đei đon lui kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu sư."
"And they rejected His statutes and His covenant that He had made with their fathers, and His testimonies which He had testified against them; they followed idols, became idolaters, and went after the nations who were all around them, concerning whom the LORD had charged them that they should not do like them.","Lu sư sơngah achăng lê̆ dôm tơdrong juăt păng tơdrong Kră Yang pơgơ̆p pơkă hăm lu yă 'bok lu sư păng dôm lu nơ̆r tơbăt wă kơ lu sư kơchăng.

"So they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, made for themselves a molded image and two calves, made a wooden image and worshiped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.","Lu sư achăng hŭt lê̆ đĭ-đăng dôm nơ̆r Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu sư tơtă, lu sư man kơdih 'bar tŏ rup rơmo kon păng pơm rup yang Asêra păng kơkuh kơ đĭ-đăng lu yang kơpal rơwơ̆ng, păng kơkuh kơ yang Baal."
"And they caused their sons and daughters to pass through the fire, practiced witchcraft and soothsaying, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke Him to anger.","Lu sư 'buh kon drŏ-nglo kon drŏ-kăn lu sư lăm ŭnh pơm tơmam soi sơmah kơ yang, lui kiơ̆ kơ pơjâu tơwir păng pơjâu lăng ti lu sư tĕch akâu lu sư kơdih pơm kơnê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, wă tơblĕk Kră Yang."
"Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them from His sight; there was none left but the tribe of Judah alone.","Yua kơ thoi noh Kră Yang hil mĭl dêh kơ lu bơngai Isơrael, puh tơweh lu sư đơ̆ng anăp Kră Yang ưh pă đei bu dơ̆ng oei pă khŭl Juđa đĕch bơih."
"Also Judah did not keep the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.","Khŭl Juđa kư̆m lei-lăi ưh kơ chu răk dôm nơ̆r Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu sư tơtă mơ̆n; na lu sư pơm kiơ̆ tơdrong juăt mă lu bơngai Isơrael chă pơjing kơdih."
"And the LORD rejected all the descendants of Israel, afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of plunderers, until He had cast them from His sight.","Lei na Kră Yang achăng lê̆ đĭ adrĕch Isơrael, pơm kơ lu sư pơmat-tat păng jao lu sư tơ lăm ti lu bơngai iŏk tơgar, dĭng đe chông phak lu sư ataih đơ̆ng muh măt Kră Yang."
"For He tore Israel from the house of David, and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king. Then Jeroboam drove Israel from following the LORD, and made them commit a great sin.","Kơplah Kră Yang tơklah lê̆ lu bơngai Isơrael đơ̆ng adrĕch Đawit, lu sư pôk Jêrôbôam, kon drŏ-nglo Nêbat pơm pơtao; sư pơhlŭ đe Isơrael tơklah đơ̆ng Kră Yang, pơm kơ lu sư pơm yoch tih."
"For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they did not depart from them","Đĭ-đăng lu bơngai Isơrael pơm kiơ̆ dôm tơdrong yoch mă Jêrôbôam hlôi pơm, lu sư ưh kơ weh đơ̆ng tơdrong yoch noh ôh"
"until the LORD removed Israel out of His sight, as He had said by all His servants the prophets. So Israel was carried away from their own land to Assyria, as it is to this day.","dĭng mah Kră Yang puh tơweh lê̆ lu sư đơ̆ng anăp Kră Yang thoi Sư hlôi yua 'bơ̆r lu đĭch đam Sư bơngai khan lê̆ adrol đei khan lê̆ bơih.

"Then the king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Ava, Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel; and they took possession of Samaria and dwelt in its cities.","Pơtao đe Asiri anhăk ba bơngai đơ̆ng Babilôn, Kuta, Awa, Hamat păng Sêpharwaim ăn lu sư oei lăm lu pơlei tơ Samari tơplih kơ lu bơngai Isơrael.

"And it was so, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they did not fear the LORD; therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which killed some of them.","Kơplah lu sư 'nao oei tơ noh, lu sư ưh kơ kơkuh ôh kơ Kră Yang, na Kră Yang ăn dăm-brang năm châu pơlôch lu mơ'nah lăm lu sư."
"So they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, “The nations whom you have removed and placed in the cities of Samaria do not know the rituals of the God of the land; therefore He has sent lions among them, and indeed, they are killing them because they do not know the rituals of the God of the land.”","Thoi noh đe roi kơ pơtao Asiri: “Lu kon pơlei mă ih anhăk ba ăn oei lăm lu pơlei tơ Samari ưh kơ băt tơdrong juăt kơkuh kơ Kră Yang lăm dêh char noh, yua kơ noh na yang ei đei athei dăm-brang năm pơlôch lu sư, kơlih kơ lu sư ưh kơ băt tơdrong juăt kơkuh kơ yang lăm char noh.”"
"Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, “Send there one of the priests whom you brought from there; let him go and dwell there, and let him teach them the rituals of the God of the land.”","Na pơtao đe Asiri wơh athei: “Lăm lu 'bok soi mă lu iĕm rôp bơih, iĕm athei rơih iŏk minh 'nu chông ba sư brŏk tơ dêh char noh wă kơ sư bơtho tơdrong juăt kơkuh kơ yang lăm dêh char noh.”"
"Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the LORD.","Thoi noh, minh 'nu bơngai lăm lu 'bok soi mă lu sư hlôi rôp đơ̆ng dêh Samari sơ̆, lu sư ăn wơ̆t brŏk oei tơ Bethel, na sư bơtho kon pơlei kơkuh kơ Kră Yang thoi yơ noh."
"However every nation continued to make gods of its own, and put them in the shrines on the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in the cities where they dwelt.","Mă-lei rim kơ adrĕch adrung, pơm pơjing yang lu sư kơdih, dan lu yang noh lăm anih kơjung mă kon pơlei Samari hlôi pơdơ̆ng pơjing, rim adrĕch adrung lu sư, dan lê̆ yang lu sư kơdih lăm pơlei mă lu sư oei."
"The men of Babylon made Succoth Benoth, the men of Cuth made Nergal, the men of Hamath made Ashima","Lu bơngai Babilôn pơm rup yang Sukôt Bênôt lu bơngai Kut pơm rup yang Nergal, lu bơngai Hamat pơm rup yang Asima"
"and the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites burned their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.","lu bơngai Awit pơm rup yang Niphas păng Tartak lu bơngai Sêpharwaim soh kon lu sư lăm ŭnh sơmah kơ yang Adrammelek păng yang Anamêlek, lu bơngai Sêpharwaim đei 'bar tŏ yang noh."
"So they feared the LORD, and from every class they appointed for themselves priests of the high places, who sacrificed for them in the shrines of the high places.","Lu sư hli kơ Kră Yang, mă-lei oei rơih iŏk lu bơngai lăm lu sư pơm 'bok soi, soi kơ yang tơ anih kơjung; yua kơ lu bơngai noh na lu 'bok soi pơyơ̆r tơmam soi lăm anih kơjung."
"They feared the LORD, yet served their own gods—according to the rituals of the nations from among whom they were carried away.","Lu adrĕch adrung ei kơkuh kơ Kră Yang mă-lei kư̆m kơkuh kơ yang sư kơdih oei bơwei lu tơdrong juăt adrĕch adrung lu sư."
"To this day they continue practicing the former rituals; they do not fear the LORD, nor do they follow their statutes or their ordinances, or the law and commandment which the LORD had commanded the children of Jacob, whom He named Israel","Dĭng truh tơ dang ei, lu sư oei pơm rok thoi tơdrong juăt so sư kơdih.

"with whom the LORD had made a covenant and charged them, saying: “You shall not fear other gods, nor bow down to them nor serve them nor sacrifice to them","Kră Yang pơm tơdrong pơgơ̆p pơkă hăm lu sư, bơtho khan kơ lu sư: “Lu iĕm 'nĕ kơkuh kơ lu yang nai, dah bơ̆jang kơ lu sư, păng 'nĕ kơ soi sơmah kơ lu sư."
"but the LORD, who brought you up from the land of Egypt with great power and an outstretched arm, Him you shall fear, Him you shall worship, and to Him you shall offer sacrifice.","Mă-lei iĕm athei hli yom kơ Kră Yang Tơ'ngla mă yua tơdrong mơsêh tih păng chro ti Sư dui, anhăk ba lu iĕm lĕch đơ̆ng dêh Êyiptơ; iĕm athei hli yom kơkuh păng pơyơ̆r kơ sư tơmam soi."
"And the statutes, the ordinances, the law, and the commandment which He wrote for you, you shall be careful to observe forever; you shall not fear other gods.","Lu tơdrong juăt nơ̆r tơtă, păng nơ̆r Kră Yang athei mă Sư chih ăn kơ lu iĕm; lu iĕm athei wei răk, pơm kiơ̆ ling-lang khŏm khŏm, 'nĕ kơkuh kơ lu yang nai."
"And the covenant that I have made with you, you shall not forget, nor shall you fear other gods.","Lu iĕm 'nĕ kơ hiơt ôh tơdrong pơgơ̆p pơkă mă Inh pơjing hăm lu iĕm 'nĕ kơkuh kơ yang nai."
"But the LORD your God you shall fear; and He will deliver you from the hand of all your enemies.”","Mă-lei, athei hli yom kơ Kră Yang 'Bok kei-Dei iĕm, Sư gô pơklaih iĕm đơ̆ng ti lu bơngai ayăt kơ iĕm.”"
"However they did not obey, but they followed their former rituals.","Mă-lei, lu adrĕch adrung ei ưh kơ chu mơ̆ng, oei pơm kiơ̆ rok thoi tơdrong juăt so sư kơdih."
"So these nations feared the LORD, yet served their carved images; also their children and their children’s children have continued doing as their fathers did, even to this day.","Thoi noh bơih, lu adrĕch adrung 'nâu kơkuh kơ Kră Yang păng kư̆m oei bơ̆jang kơ lu rup yang mă lu sư pơm kơdih; đơ̆ng yă 'bok lu sư pơm thoi yơ, na lu kon sâu sư kư̆m oei pơm thoi noh truh tơ dang ei."
"Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea the son of Elah, king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz, king of Judah, began to reign.","Lăm sơnăm mă pêng, chăl Hôsêa, kon drŏ-nglo Êlah, pơtao Isơrael, na Hesekia kon drŏ-nglo Ahas pơtao đe Juđa tŏk pơm pơtao."
"He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah.","Kơplah sư tŏk pơm pơtao, sư 'nao 'bar-jĭt pơđăm sơnăm păng sư pơgơ̆r 'bar-jĭt tơsĭn sơnăm lăm pơlei Jêrusalem.

"And he did what was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father David had done.","Sư pơm 'lơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang thoi Đawit, 'bok kơdră sư sơ̆ hlôi pơm."
"He removed the high places and broke the sacred pillars, cut down the wooden image and broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made; for until those days the children of Israel burned incense to it, and called it Nehushtan.","Sư yuih lê̆ đĭ dôm lu hnam kơkuh kơ yang tơ anih kơjung, teh pơchah lê̆ chơnang soi, teh tơhuŏng lê̆ rup yang Asêra păng teh pơchah lê̆ 'bih mă Môis pơm hăm kong sơ̆, yua kơ truh kơ jơhnơr sư, lu bơngai Isơrael oei soh ăn 'long 'bâu phu kơ rup yang 'bih.

"He trusted in the LORD God of Israel, so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor who were before him.","Hesekia gơnang kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei đe Isơrael; lei na lu pơtao đơ̆ng rŏng kơ sư, dah lăm lu pơtao adrol kơ sư, ưh kơ đei bu thoi sư."
"For he held fast to the LORD; he did not depart from following Him, but kept His commandments, which the LORD had commanded Moses.","Sư oei kơjăp hăm Kră Yang, ưh kơ achăng lê̆ ôh, sư wei răk dôm nơ̆r Kră Yang tơtă ăn kơ Môis."
"The LORD was with him; he prospered wherever he went. And he rebelled against the king of Assyria and did not serve him.","Kră Yang oei hơdai hăm sư; dôm sư pơm kiơ, dah jang kiơ gơh jing. Sư blah pơtao đe Asiri, ưh pă chu kơ pơtao ei dơ̆ng."
"He subdued the Philistines, as far as Gaza and its territory, from watchtower to fortified city.","Sư blah dêh char lu bơngai Philistin, truh tơ pơlei Gasa păng tơring jum dăr đơ̆ng hnam thôt gak truh tơ pơlei tih đei kông kơjăp."
"Now it came to pass in the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea the son of Elah, king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria and besieged it.","Truh lăm sơnăm mă puăn, chăl pơtao Hesekia pơgơ̆r 'blep kơ sơnăm mă tơpơh, chăl Hôsêa, kon drŏ-nglo Êlah, pơtao đe Isơrael, na Salmaneser, pơtao đe Asiri năm blah pơlei Samari, wang tăp kơ pơlei noh."
"And at the end of three years they took it. In the sixth year of Hezekiah, that is, the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken.","Pêng sơnăm đơ̆ng rŏng, sư blah iŏk Pơlei Samari.

"Then the king of Assyria carried Israel away captive to Assyria, and put them in Halah and by the Habor, the River of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes","Pơtao đe Asiri chông ba lu kon pơlei Isơrael năm tơ Asiri, ăn kơ lu sư oei tơ Hala, 'bơ̆t đak Krong Habôr lăm tơring Gôsan păng ăn mơ'nah lu sư oei tơ lu pơlei lăm tơring Mêđi."
"because they did not obey the voice of the LORD their God, but transgressed His covenant and all that Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded; and they would neither hear nor do them.","Noh, yua kơ lu sư ưh kơ chu kiơ̆ nơ̆r Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu sư bơtho khan, mă-lei lu sư pơm glăi kơ tơdrong Kră Yang pơgơ̆p pơkă, lu sư ưh kơ wă, mơ̆ng păng kuă kơ pơm kiơ̆ dôm tơdrong mă Môis, đĭch đam Kră Yang hlôi bơtho."
"And in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them.","Lăm sơnăm mă mơjĭt-puăn, chăl pơtao Hesekia pơgơ̆r, Senacherip, pơtao đe Asiri năm blah lu pơlei tih kơjăp, lăm dêh Juđa păng lu sư iŏk pơlei noh."
"Then Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria at Lachish, saying, “I have done wrong; turn away from me; whatever you impose on me I will pay.” And the king of Assyria assessed Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.","Hesekia, pơtao đe Juđa wơh bơngai năm tơ pơlei Lakis, roi ăn kơ pơtao đe Asiri khan: “Inh yoch glăi bơih.

"So Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the king’s house.","Hesekia ăn kơ sư dôm lu jên hu đơ̆ng lăm hnam akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang păng đơ̆ng lăm hnam mong tơmam anih pơtao."
"At that time Hezekiah stripped the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.","Kơplah noh, Hesekia plôh iŏk maih đơ̆ng lom lu 'măng, păng plôh iŏk maih đơ̆ng 'long dơ̆ng 'măng hnam akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang, mă đêl kơdih sư 'mơ̆i lom 'măng noh ăn pơđĭ kơ pơtao đe Asiri."
"Then the king of Assyria sent the Tartan, the Rabsaris, and the Rabshakeh from Lachish, with a great army against Jerusalem, to King Hezekiah. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. When they had come up, they went and stood by the aqueduct from the upper pool, which was on the highway to the Fuller’s Field.","Mă-lei, pơtao đe Asiri wơh Tartan, Rapsaris păng Rapsaka chông ba minh khŭl linh lơ đơ̆ng pơlei Lakis, năm tơ Hesekia tơ pơlei Jêrusalem lu sư truh tơ pơlei Jêrusalem.

"And when they had called to the king, Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came out to them.","Đơ̆ng noh, lu sư apinh pơma dơnuh hăm pơtao; Êliakim, kon drŏ-nglo Hilkia, 'bok tih wei hnam pơtao; Sepna bơngai chih hla bơar, păng Jôa kon drŏ-nglo Asap bơngai chih răk dôm tơdrong truh, lĕch năm tơ'bơ̆p lu sư."
"Then the Rabshakeh said to them, “Say now to Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: “What confidence is this in which you trust?","Rapsaka khan kơ lu sư: “Brŏk khan bĕ kơ Hesekia:” “'Nâu pơtao đe Asiri, pơtao tih khan: Ih gơnang kơ bu tơgŭm ih?"
"You speak of having plans and power for war; but they are mere words. And in whom do you trust, that you rebel against me?","Ih khan yua 'bơ̆r hoh đĕch gơh đei, pran kơtang kĕ tơblah. Na dang ei, ih hơmĕng gơnang kơ bu mă pơ̆n tơblah hăm inh?"
"Now look! You are trusting in the staff of this broken reed, Egypt, on which if a man leans, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him.","Noh dang ei ih gơnang kơ Êyiptơ hă? Noh jơ̆ thoi 'long gơlar tơgơ̆, dah bu tơjră kơ 'long noh sĭt gô trŏ ti klĕch hloi.

"But if you say to me, ‘We trust in the LORD our God,’ is it not He whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and said to Judah and Jerusalem, ‘You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem’?” ’","Mă-lei tơdah ih khan kơ inh: “Lu nhôn gơnang kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei nhôn.

"Now therefore, I urge you, give a pledge to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses—if you are able on your part to put riders on them!","Lei ih pơkă bĕ hăm yŏng tơ'ngla inh, pơtao Asiri sư khan: Inh gô jao ăn kơ ih 'bar-rơbâu tŏ aseh dah ih ăn đei bơngai wă hao aseh noh."
"How then will you repel one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put your trust in Egypt for chariots and horsemen?","Liơ iĕm gơh blah pơpuh minh 'nu yŏng linh lu đĭch đam yŏng tơ'ngla inh dah mă iĕm gơnang kơ char Êyiptơ wă kơ đei bơngai hao gre aseh păng gre aseh năm blah yŏng tơ'ngla inh hă?

"Have I now come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it? The LORD said to me, ‘Go up against this land, and destroy it.’ ”","Hloh kơ noh dơ̆ng, nhôn năm blah dêh 'nâu, nhôn ưh kơ kiơ̆ thoi nơ̆r Kră Yang athei hă? Kră Yang khan kơ inh: Năm blah dêh âu bĕ păng pơrăm lê̆ sư.”"
"Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, Shebna, and Joah said to the Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it; and do not speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.”","Kơplah noh Êliakim, kon drŏ-nglo Hilkia, Sepna păng Jôa khan kơ Rapsaka: “Pơma hăm nhôn đĭch đam ih nơ̆r Aram bĕ yua kơ nhôn hlôh nơ̆r noh.

"But the Rabshakeh said to them, “Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall, who will eat and drink their own waste with you?”","Mă-lei Rapsaka tơl khan: “Hăm trŏ kơ yŏng tơ'ngla inh wơh inh năm tơ âu wă pơma hăm yŏng tơ'ngla iĕm păng hăm iĕm đĕch, na ưh kơ pơma hăm lu bơngai mă oei dơ̆ng kơpal dur lu bơngai mă gô sa ĭch nhă đak hơyô kơdih thoi lu iĕm noh hă?”"
"Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out with a loud voice in Hebrew, and spoke, saying, “Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria!","Đơ̆ng noh, Rapsaka dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t ei pơma pơret hăm nơ̆r Juđa khan: “Mơ̆ng bĕ nơ̆r pơtao đe Asiri, pơtao tih pơma."

"Do not listen to Hezekiah; for thus says the king of Assyria: ‘Make peace with me by a present and come out to me; and every one of you eat from his own vine and every one from his own fig tree, and every one of you drink the waters of his own cistern","'Nĕ kơ mơ̆ng Hesekia, pơtao đe Asiri khan: “Athei hiôk hăm nhôn păng kŭp kơ̆l yơ̆r ti kơ nhôn bĕ; na rim 'nu lăm lu iĕm gô đei sa plei 'long lăm pơgar hơmu iĕm kơdih păng plei hơra iĕm, păng nhă đak sơlŭng iĕm kơdih"
"until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive groves and honey, that you may live and not die.

"Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of the Rabshakeh.","Êliakim, kon drŏ-nglo Hilkia, bơngai wei hnam pơtao.

"It may be that the LORD your God will hear all the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to reproach the living God, and will rebuke the words which the LORD your God has heard.

"Have the gods of the nations delivered those whom my fathers have destroyed, Gozan and Haran and Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telassar?","Lu yang kơ lu adrĕch adrung nai mă lu 'bok kơdră inh hlôi pơrăm bơih, noh yang char Gôsan, pơlei Haran, Rêtsep, păng lu bơngai Êđen oei tơ Pơlei Têl Asar, sư gơh dŏng pơklaih lu sư mơ̆n hă?"
"Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?’ ”","Bĭ pơtao dêh char Hamat, dêh char Arpat, pơtao Pơlei Sêpharwaim, pơtao đe Hêna păng pơtao đe Iwa, lu sư tơ yơ ngăl?”"
"And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.","Hesekia đei iŏk kơthơ đơ̆ng ti lu bơngai ăn kơ sư, na sư đŏk.

"Then Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said: “O LORD God of Israel, the One who dwells between the cherubim, You are God, You alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth.","Hesekia krao khan 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang khan: Ơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu bơngai Isơrael! Ih oei kơpơ̆ng lu chêrubim.

"Incline Your ear, O LORD, and hear; open Your eyes, O LORD, and see; and hear the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to reproach the living God.","Ơ Kră Yang apinh Ih pơđêng đon mơ̆ng bĕ.

"By your messengers you have reproached the Lord, And said: “By the multitude of my chariots I have come up to the height of the mountains, To the limits of Lebanon; I will cut down its tall cedars And its choice cypress trees; I will enter the extremity of its borders, To its fruitful forest.","Ih hlôi yua lu bơngai jang kơ ih na ih blei hiap Kră Yang.

"And the remnant who have escaped of the house of Judah Shall again take root downward, And bear fruit upward.","Mơ'nah lăm teh đe Juđa oei oei, lei sư gô chăt rơh păng pơkao đei plei."
"For out of Jerusalem shall go a remnant, And those who escape from Mount Zion. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.’","Na đei lu mơ'nah klaih klăi đơ̆ng lăm pơlei Jêrusalem. Đơ̆ng kông Siôn gô đei khŭl klaih đơ̆ng tơdrong truh. Đĭ jơhngơ̆m tơpăt Kră Yang gô pơm tơdrong 'noh."

"And it came to pass on a certain night that the angel of the LORD went out, and killed in the camp of the Assyrians one hundred and eighty-five thousand; and when people arose early in the morning, there were the corpses—all dead.","Lăm măng noh, đei minh 'nu linh jang 'lơ̆ng Kră Yang năm tơ anih kơđông Asiri păng pơlôch minh-hrĕng tơhngam-jĭt pơđăm-rơbâu 'nu bơngai tơ noh.

"So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and went away, returned home, and remained at Nineveh.","Na Senacherip, pơtao đe Asiri, kơdâu brŏk, oei tơ pơlei Ninewơ."
"Now it came to pass, as he was worshiping in the temple of Nisroch his god, that his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him down with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. Then Esarhaddon his son reigned in his place.","Kơplah sư oei kơkuh kơ yang lăm hnam yang Nisrôk, yang sư, na bre kon sư Adrammelek păng Sarêser pơlôch lê̆ sư hăm đao gưm; đơ̆ng noh lu sư kơdâu ôn lăm dêh char Ararat, na Êsarhađôn; kon drŏ-nglo sư tŏk pơm pơtao pơgơ̆r pơtrơp sư."
"In those days Hezekiah was sick and near death.

"Then he turned his face toward the wall, and prayed to the LORD, saying","Na Hesekia tơwih muh măt sư tơ tơnăr hnam păng krao khan kơ Kră Yang"
"“Remember now, O LORD, I pray, how I have walked before You in truth and with a loyal heart, and have done what was good in Your sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly.","“Ơ Kră Yang!

"“Return and tell Hezekiah the leader of My people, ‘Thus says the LORD, the God of David your father: “I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; surely I will heal you.

"And I will add to your days fifteen years.

"Then Isaiah said, “Take a lump of figs.” So they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.","Na Êsai athei: “Iŏk minh pôm 'bĕng pơm păng plei hơra bĕ. Iŏk 'bĕng noh dan 'bơ̆t kơ̆l pơtôch na sư gơh klaih.”"

"So Isaiah the prophet cried out to the LORD, and He brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down on the sundial of Ahaz.","Êsai bơngai khan lê̆ adrol, krao apinh Kră Yang; na Kră Yang dui kơdŭn lê̆ yơ̆p ngôi măt 'năr pơchrang kơ kơnao kung Ahas păk hơlơ̆k tơ rŏng mơjĭt yak"
"At that time Berodach-Baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he heard that Hezekiah had been sick.","Lăm kơplah noh, Mêrôđak Balađan, kon drŏ-nglo Balađan, pơtao đe Babilôn wơh bơngai năm ăn kơ Hesekia kơthơ păng tơmam yua kơ sư kơtơ̆ng Hesekia jĭ."
"And Hezekiah was attentive to them, and showed them all the house of his treasures—the silver and gold, the spices and precious ointment, and all his armory—all that was found among his treasures. There was nothing in his house or in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them.","Hesekia kơtơ̆ng lu đe ei roi, sư hiôk dêh, na sư chông lu đe ei năm lăng anih mong tơmam sư, maih, hu, tơmam 'bâu phu rơmă ôliwơ gĭt păng lăng anih mong tơmam tơblah păng lăng tôm tơmam lăm hnam sư mong noh.

"Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah, and said to him, “What did these men say, and from where did they come to you?” So Hezekiah said, “They came from a far country, from Babylon.”","Na Êsai bơngai khan lê̆ adrol năm tơ pơtao Hesekia păng jet sư: “Lu bơngai noh, roi tơdrong kiơ păng lu sư đơ̆ng dêh char ayơ mă năm truh tơ âu?” Hesekia tơl: “Lu sư đơ̆ng dêh ataih, đơ̆ng char Babilôn.”"
"And he said, “What have they seen in your house?” So Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.”","Êsai khan: “Ih ăn kơ lu sư lăng kiơ tơ hnam pơtao ih?” Hesekia tơl: “Lu sư lăng tôm bơih tơmam lăm hnam inh.

"Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the LORD","Na Êsai khan kơ Hesekia thoi âu: “Mơ̆ng bĕ nơ̆r Kră Yang khan"
"‘Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house, and what your fathers have accumulated until this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left,’ says the LORD.","Jơ 'năr gô truh, dôm tơmam lăm hnam ih mong dôm lu mŭk tơmam mă yă 'bok ih đei pơsư̆ 'măn lê̆ đơ̆ng sơ̆ truh tơ dang ei đe gô iŏk pơđĭ, chĕp ba tơ dêh Babilôn.

"Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah—all his might, and how he made a pool and a tunnel and brought water into the city—are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?","Dôm lu tơdrong hơ'mon nai gah Hesekia, tơdrong pơgơ̆r, tơdrong sư man pơm đak dơnâu păng pơm hơbong pơro đak tơmơ̆t lăm pơlei, đe đei chih tơ lăm sơ̆p hla bơar hơ'mon gah lu pơtao đe Juđa?"

"For he rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; he raised up altars for Baal, and made a wooden image, as Ahab king of Israel had done; and he worshiped all the host of heaven and served them.","Sư hơmet ming lu hnam kơkuh kơ rup yang tơ kơpal kông đêl 'bă sư Hesekia yuih pơrăm lê̆ bơih; sư pơm ming chơnang soi kơkuh kơ yang Baal, pơdơ̆ng pơm ming rup Asêra lei-lăi thoi Ahap, pơtao đe Isơrael hlôi pơm bơih sơ̆, Sư soi sơmah kơ đĭ-đăng lu yang kơpal plĕnh păng bơ̆jang ăn kơ lu sư."

"Also he made his son pass through the fire, practiced soothsaying, used witchcraft, and consulted spiritists and mediums.

"He even set a carved image of Asherah that he had made, in the house of which the LORD had said to David and to Solomon his son, “In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put My name forever","Sư dan rup Asêra mă sư đei pơm lăm hnam akŭm mă Kră Yang đei khan bơih kơ Đawit păng Sôlômôn, kon drŏ-nglo sư, noh: “Lăm hnam akŭm 'nâu păng lăm Pơlei Jêrusalem; pơlei mă Inh hlôi rơih lăm lu khŭl Isơrael Inh gô ăn anăn Inh oei lăm noh, ling-lang khŏm khŏm."
"and I will not make the feet of Israel wander anymore from the land which I gave their fathers—only if they are careful to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that My servant Moses commanded them.”","Dah lu bơngai Isơrael wei răk dôm tơdrong Inh bơtho khan, dôm tơdrong juăt Môis đĭch đam Inh hlôi bơtho kơ lu sư, lei Inh gô ưh kơ lê̆ lu sư chă năm jơ̆p-jang tơ 'nguaih kơ dêh char mă inh ăn bơih kơ lu yă 'bok lu sư.”"
"But they paid no attention, and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than the nations whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel.","Mă-lei lu sư ưh kơ mơ̆ng ôh, lu sư chu Manase pơhlŭ pơlung lu sư pơm tơdrong kơnê̆ lơ hloh kơ lu adrĕch adrung mă Kră Yang hlôi pơrăm pơtôch bơih 'bơ̆t anăp bơngai Isơrael."
"And the LORD spoke by His servants the prophets, saying","Na Kră Yang yua lu bơngai khan lê̆ adrol, lu đĭch đam Sư, bơtho khan kơ lu sư"
"“Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these abominations (he has acted more wickedly than all the Amorites who were before him, and has also made Judah sin with his idols)","“Manase, pơtao đe Juđa hlôi pơm tơdrong yoch kơnê̆ krưp 'nâu păng pơm tơdrong kơnê̆ hloh kơ đĭ-đăng lu bơngai Amôrit hlôi pơm adrol kơ sư păng sư pơm kơ lu bơngai Isơrael pơm yoch kơkuh kơ lu rup yang đêl sư pơm."

"And I will stretch over Jerusalem the measuring line of Samaria and the plummet of the house of Ahab; I will wipe Jerusalem as one wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.","Inh gô iŏk tơlei đơ̆ng pơtŏ dêh Samari păng tơlei đơ̆ng pơtŏ adrĕch Ahap, dăng lăm pơlei Jêrusalem dơ̆ng, inh gô sŭt pơgoh lê̆ pơlei Jêrusalem thoi đe ôp sŭt pơnhan, đơ̆ng noh gơsŭp lê̆ sư."
"So I will forsake the remnant of My inheritance and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become victims of plunder to all their enemies","Inh gô achăng hŭt lê̆ lu bơngai mă oei arih mă khan lu sư gah Inh ră, păng Inh jao lu sư kơ lu ayăt, lu sư jing tơmam sa lu ayăt păng thoi tơmam đe iŏk đêl tơblah jei bơih."

"Moreover Manasseh shed very much innocent blood, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another, besides his sin by which he made Judah sin, in doing evil in the sight of the LORD.","Hloh kơ noh dơ̆ng, Manase kư̆m pơlôch lơ bơngai ưh kơ đei yoch dĭng mah pham 'bĕnh-'bang kơ pơlei Jêrusalem, đơ̆ng pah âu truh tơ pah to, 'nguaih kơ tơdrong pơm kơ lu bơngai Juđa pơm yoch păng pơm kơnê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang hai dơ̆ng."
"Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh—all that he did, and the sin that he committed—are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?","Dôm lu tơdrong hơ'mon nai gah Manase, lu tơdrong jang đêl sư pơm, păng tơdrong yoch sư hlôi pơm đe đei chih lê̆ ngăl bơih tơ lăm sơ̆p hla bơar hơ'mon gah lu pơtao đe Juđa?"
"So Manasseh rested with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza. Then his son Amon reigned in his place.","Manase lôch thoi tep hiôk hăm lu 'bok kơdră sư, đe 'bŭ sư tơ lăm pơgar pơkao Usa. Pơgar pơkao lăm anih pơtao. Ammôn kon drŏ-nglo sư pơgơ̆r pơtrơp sư."
"Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.","Kơplah Ammôn tŏk pơm pơtao, sư 'nao 'bar-jĭt 'bar sơnăm; sư pơgơ̆r 'bar sơnăm tơ lăm Pơlei Jêrusalem.

"And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father Manasseh had done.","Sư pơm tơdrong kơnê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang lei-lăi thoi Manase 'bă sư hlôi pơm bơih."
"So he walked in all the ways that his father had walked; and he served the idols that his father had served, and worshiped them.","Sư năm rok kiơ̆ pôm trong 'bă sư rok bơih, bơ̆jang kơ rup yang mă đêl 'bă sư hlôi bơ̆jang bơih păng drap kơkuh bơih kơ lu rup yang noh."
"He forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and did not walk in the way of the LORD.","Sư achăng lê̆ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu yă 'bok sư, sư ưh kơ năm kiơ̆ trong Kră Yang ôh."
"Then the servants of Amon conspired against him, and killed the king in his own house.","Thoi noh, lu đĭch đam Ammôn chă đon blơ̆ sư păng pơlôch lê̆ sư lăm hnam pơtao sư."
"But the people of the land executed all those who had conspired against King Amon. Then the people of the land made his son Josiah king in his place.","Mă-lei, kon pơlei lăm dêh char sư pơlôch lê̆ đĭ-đăng bơngai mă pơlôch pơtao Ammôn ei, păng pôk Jôsia, kon drŏ-nglo sư, tŏk pơm pơtao tơplih sư."
"Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?","Dôm lu tơdrong hơ'mon nai gah Ammôn păng tơdrong jang đêl sư pơm, đe đei chih bơih tơ lăm sơ̆p hla bơar hơ'mon gah lu pơtao đe Juđa"
"And he was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza. Then Josiah his son reigned in his place.","Đe 'bŭ sư tơ lăm bơsat tơ pơgar pơkao Usa; đơ̆ng noh Jôsia kon drŏ-nglo sư pơgơ̆r pơtrơp sư."
"Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath.","Kơplah Jôsia tŏk pơm pơtao, sư 'nao tơhngam sơnăm; sư pơgơ̆r pêng-jĭt mônh sơnăm tơ lăm Pơlei Jêrusalem.

"And he did what was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in all the ways of his father David; he did not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.","Sư pơm 'lơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, năm kiơ̆ tôm tơdrong Đawit, 'bok kơdră sư sơ̆, sư ưh kơ weh gah 'ma dah gah 'ngiĕo ôh."
"Now it came to pass, in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the scribe, the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, to the house of the LORD, saying","Lăm sơnăm mă mơjĭt-tơhngam chăl Jôsia pơgơ̆r, sư wơh 'bok chih hla bơar anăn sư Saphan, kon drŏ-nglo Asalia, sâu Mêsulam, năm tơ Hnam Kră Yang, na tơtă khan"
"“Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may count the money which has been brought into the house of the LORD, which the doorkeepers have gathered from the people.","“Năm bĕ tơ 'bok soi tơm anăn sư Hilkia, wă kơ sư jô̆ jên mă đe hlôi chĕp ba bơih tơ lăm hnam akŭm Kră Yang, noh jên mă lu bơngai wei 'măng Hnam akŭm hlôi iŏk bơih đơ̆ng kon pơlei"
"And let them deliver it into the hand of those doing the work, who are the overseers in the house of the LORD; let them give it to those who are in the house of the LORD doing the work, to repair the damages of the house","Đơ̆ng noh athei pơjao jên noh kơ lu bơngai wei tơdrong jang hơmet Hnam akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang, wă kơ lu sư hơmet ming Hnam akŭm"
"to carpenters and builders and masons—and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house.","Noh lu thơ̆ traih ming 'long, thơ̆ pơm thơ̆ man tơmo păng yua răt 'long păng răt tơmo đe blah bơih wă hơmet ming Hnam akŭm."
"However there need be no accounting made with them of the money delivered into their hand, because they deal faithfully.”","Mă-lei, huay pă jô̆ dơ̆ng jên mă đe jao bơih kơ lu sư, yua kơ lu sư bơngai jang 'lơ̆ng jang tơnăp.”"
"Then Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the LORD.” And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.","Hilkia, 'bok soi tơm, sư khan kơ Saphan bơngai chih hla bơar: “Inh chă 'bôh bơih Sơ̆p hla bơar khôi juăt đơ̆ng lăm Hnam akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang.” Hilkia ăn kơ Saphan sơ̆p hla bơar noh, na Saphan iŏk đŏk lăng."
"So Shaphan the scribe went to the king, bringing the king word, saying, “Your servants have gathered the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of those who do the work, who oversee the house of the LORD.”","Đơ̆ng noh, Saphan bơngai chih hla bơar năm tơ'bơ̆p pơtao na khan: “Lu đĭch đam Ih ăn bơih jên mă chă đei lăm hnam akŭm noh păng jao bơih 'bơ̆t ti lu bơngai wei tơdrong jang pơm hơmet ming Hnam akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang.”"
"Then Shaphan the scribe showed the king, saying, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read it before the king.","Saphan bơngai chih hla bơar khan: “Hilkia, 'bok soi tơm, sư ăn kơ inh minh sơ̆p hla bơar.” Đơ̆ng noh Saphan, đŏk tơm măt pơtao."
"Now it happened, when the king heard the words of the Book of the Law, that he tore his clothes.","Lăp wă pơtao kơtơ̆ng nơ̆r lăm Sơ̆p hla bơar khôi juăt boih, na sư hek hloi ao sư."
"Then the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Achbor the son of Michaiah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king, saying","Đơ̆ng noh pơtao athei 'bok soi Hilkia păng Ahikam kon drŏ-nglo Saphan Akbôr kon drŏ-nglo Mikaia, Saphan bơngai chih hla bơar hăm Asaia đĭch đam sư, pơtao khan"
"“Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found; for great is the wrath of the LORD that is aroused against us, because our fathers have not obeyed the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.”","“Năm, krao apinh kơ inh Kră Yang bĕ, krao apinh kơ kon pơlei pơla, păng krao apinh kơ đĭ char Juđa bơ̆n gah dôm lu nơ̆r lăm sơ̆p hla bơar mă 'nao 'bôh noh.

"So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe. (She dwelt in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter.) And they spoke with her.","Thoi noh, lu đe 'bok soi Hilkia, Ahikam, Akbôr, Saphan păng Asaia, lu sư năm tơ bơngai khan lê̆ adrol drŏ-kăn, anăn sư Hulda, akăn Sallum, bơngai wei ao kơ̆m giĕng, kon drŏ-nglo Tikwa, sâu Harhas; sư oei tơ lăm pơlei Jêrusalem, lăm tơring mă 'Bar, lu sư pơma dơnuh hăm duch ei"
"Then she said to them, “Thus says the LORD God of Israel, ‘Tell the man who sent you to Me","Na duch ei khan: “Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu bơngai Isơrael khan: Iĕm brŏk roi bĕ kơ bơngai wơh iĕm năm tơ inh noh, thoi âu"
"“Thus says the LORD: ‘Behold, I will bring calamity on this place and on its inhabitants—all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read","Kră Yang khan: “Inh gô ăn tơdrong răm tih truh 'bơ̆t anih 'nâu păng truh kơ kon pơlei lăm noh hai, thoi nơ̆r đơ̆ng sơ̆p hla bơar mă pơtao đe Juđa hlôi đŏk noh."
"because they have forsaken Me and burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands. Therefore My wrath shall be aroused against this place and shall not be quenched.’ ” ’","Yua kơ lu bơngai Juđa achăng lê̆ Inh bơih, soh 'long 'bâu phu ăn kơ yang nai, tơblĕk, pơm kơ Inh areh yua kơ đơ̆ng tơdrong jang đêl tơpang ti lu sư pơm, noh bơih tơdrong Inh hil mĭl gô tuh 'bơ̆t anih 'nâu, inh ưh kơ layơ păt hơngăm."
"But as for the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, in this manner you shall speak to him, ‘Thus says the LORD God of Israel: “Concerning the words which you have heard","Na gah pơtao đe Juđa mă wơh iĕm krao apinh Kră Yang noh, iĕm athei roi kơ sư: Gah lu nơ̆r mă ih hlôi kơtơ̆ng noh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu bơngai Isơrael khan thoi âu"
"because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before the LORD when you heard what I spoke against this place and against its inhabitants, that they would become a desolation and a curse, and you tore your clothes and wept before Me, I also have heard you,” says the LORD.","Yua kơ ih đei jơhngơ̆m tơbral bơih, băt tơjur akâu kơdih 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang 'bơ̆t ih kơtơ̆ng Inh pơma hil kơ teh 'nâu hăm kon pơlei lăm noh, dĭng lu sư jing juơ rơhiăng, kon pơlei sư pŭ hiap pơtê̆, mă-lei yua kơ ih hek ao, păng nhơ̆m hơdrĭ 'bơ̆t anăp Inh; yua kơ noh inh kư̆m kơtơ̆ng nơ̆r ih bơih."
"“Surely, therefore, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace; and your eyes shall not see all the calamity which I will bring on this place.” ’ ” So they brought back word to the king.","'Noh, inh gô iŏk ih brŏk hơdai tơ lu yă 'bok ih; păng đe gô 'bŭ ih lăm bơsat hăm tơdrong hiôk-hian, păng măt ih gô ưh kơ 'bôh tơdrong răm truh mă inh wă tơjruh 'bơ̆t anih teh 'nâu.” Na lu sư brŏk roi ăn kơ pơtao dôm lu nơ̆r noh."
"Now the king sent them to gather all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem to him.","Na pơtao wơh bơngai akŭm pơpôi đĭ-đăng lu kră pơlei đe Juđa păng đe Jêrusalem năm tơ'bơ̆p sư."
"The king went up to the house of the LORD with all the men of Judah, and with him all the inhabitants of Jerusalem—the priests and the prophets and all the people, both small and great. And he read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant which had been found in the house of the LORD.","Đơ̆ng noh pơtao năm tơ Hnam akŭm Kră Yang, lơ bơngai kiơ̆ sư đei đĭ-đăng lu bơngai Juđa, lăm Pơlei Jêrusalem, đĭ-đăng lu 'bok soi, lu bơngai khan lê̆ adrol păng đĭ-đăng kon pơlei, 'lơ̆p 'lŏ kiơ̆ sư.

"Then the king stood by a pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD and to keep His commandments and His testimonies and His statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people took a stand for the covenant.","Pơtao dơ̆ng tơ anăp 'bơ̆t anih kơjung pơgơ̆p pơkă dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, wă năm kiơ̆ Kră Yang, đĭ jơhngơ̆m tơdrong tơchĕng wei răk dôm tơdrong Kră Yang tơtă, dôm khôi juăt Sư, păng pơm pơkeh nơ̆r Kră Yang pơgơ̆p pơkă mă đe đei chih lăm sơ̆p hla bơar 'nâu.

"And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, the priests of the second order, and the doorkeepers, to bring out of the temple of the LORD all the articles that were made for Baal, for Asherah, and for all the host of heaven; and he burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried their ashes to Bethel.","Na pơtao tơtă kơ Hilkia 'bok soi tơm, wơh lu 'bok soi nai păng wơh lu bơngai wei 'măng Hnam akŭm, athei lu sư chĕp ba đĭ dôm lu tơmam đơ̆ng Hnam Kră Yang lu tơmam mă đe pơm wă soi sơmah kơ yang Baal yang Asêra păng đĭ-đăng tơmam kơkuh kơ yang kơpal anê̆ rơwơ̆ng, sư athei đe soh lê̆ dôm tơmam 'noh tơ jih Pơlei Jêrusalem, lăm thŭng Kidrôn, đơ̆ng noh chĕp ba rơnok tơnuh sư tơ Pơlei Bethel."
"Then he removed the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense on the high places in the cities of Judah and in the places all around Jerusalem, and those who burned incense to Baal, to the sun, to the moon, to the constellations, and to all the host of heaven.","Sư kư̆m puh tơweh lê̆ lu 'bok soi jang kơ lu rup yang, mă đêl pơtao đe Juđa hlôi pơkă wă pôk lu sư soh 'long 'bâu phu tơ anih kơjung, pơm jơ̆p-jang kơ dêh char Juđa păng pơm tơ anih tăp dăr Pơlei Jêrusalem.

"And he brought out the wooden image from the house of the LORD, to the Brook Kidron outside Jerusalem, burned it at the Brook Kidron and ground it to ashes, and threw its ashes on the graves of the common people.","Sư iŏk lê̆ rup yang Asêra đơ̆ng lăm Hnam akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang, chĕp ba tơ jih Pơlei Jêrusalem, truh tơ thŭng Kidrôn, soh lê̆ tơ ei dĭng rơnok đĭ, đơ̆ng noh prôi rơnok ei kơpal bơsat kon pơlei."
"Then he tore down the ritual booths of the perverted persons that were in the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the wooden image.","Sư kư̆m yuih hŭt teh pơchah lê̆ anih drŏ-nglo ngôi pơm kư̆ kă lăm Hnam akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang, tơ anih noh lu drŏ-kăn tanh che ăn kơ yang Asêra."
"And he brought all the priests from the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba; also he broke down the high places at the gates which were at the entrance of the Gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were to the left of the city gate.","Sư kư̆m chông tơlĕch đĭ-đăng lu 'bok soi mă oei đơ̆ng jơ̆p-jang pơlei lăm dêh char Juđa, na pơm pơ'mê̆ lê̆ anih kơkuh kơ rup tơ anih kơjung anih mă lu sư ngăl soh 'long 'bâu phu, đơ̆ng Pơlei Gêba dĭng truh tơ Pơlei Bêrsêba; đơ̆ng noh sư kư̆m teh pơchah lu chơnang soi kơ yang tơ 'nguaih 'măng dur pơlei, noh 'bơ̆t jê̆ 'măng Jôsuê yŏng wei pơlei, tơ gah 'ngiĕo kơ 'măng jang pơlei."
"Nevertheless the priests of the high places did not come up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they ate unleavened bread among their brethren.","Mă-lei, lu 'bok soi gah anih kơjung, lu sư ưh kơ gơh soi tơ chơnang soi Kră Yang tơ Pơlei Jêrusalem; mă-lei lu sư gơh sa 'bĕng ưh kơ đei 'buih pông, hơdai hăm lu 'nhŏng oh sư đĕch."
"And he defiled Topheth, which is in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter pass through the fire to Molech.","Pơtao kư̆m pơm pơ'mê̆ lê̆ anih Tôphêt lăm Thŭng Ben Hinôm, wă kơ đơ̆ng âu tơ anăp, ưh kơ đei bu gơh soh pơyơ̆r kon drŏ-nglo dah kon drŏ-kăn sư soi sơmah kơ yang Mơlek."
"Then he removed the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun, at the entrance to the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathan-Melech, the officer who was in the court; and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire.","Lu sư teh pơpuh lu aseh mă lu pơtao đe Juđa pơyơ̆r ăn kơ yang măt 'năr, pơdơ̆ng 'bơ̆t 'măng mơ̆t tơ Hnam akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang, jê̆ hnam linh krĕo anăn sư Nathan Mêlek, 'bơ̆t cham Hnam akŭm,’ Jôsia soh rŭk lê̆ đĭ lu gre aseh pơyơ̆r kơ yang măt 'năr."
"The altars that were on the roof, the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, the king broke down and pulverized there, and threw their dust into the Brook Kidron.","Pơtao Jôsia kư̆m teng lê̆ lu chơnang soi mă lu pơtao đe Juđa pơm kơpal bơbŭng hnam kơjung, hnam pơtao Ahas; na gah lu chơnang soi mă Manase đei pơdơ̆ng 'bơ̆t 'bar tŏ cham hnam akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang, sư tơlơ̆ păng teh pơchah lê̆, na chĕp ba săi lê̆ kơcheh sư lăm thŭng Kidrôn."
"Then the king defiled the high places that were east of Jerusalem, which were on the south of the Mount of Corruption, which Solomon king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the people of Ammon.","Sư pơm pơ'mê̆ lê̆ lu hnam kơkuh kơ yang nai pơm tơ anih kơjung gah hơlĕch Pơlei Jêrusalem, gah gơal kơ Kông lôch răm, lu anih kơkuh kơ yang noh Sôlômôn pơtao đe Isơrael pơm wă soi sơmah kơ yang Astoret rup yang mă kơnê̆ krưp dêh lu bơngai Siđôn, pơm yang Kêmôs rup yang mă kơnê̆ krưp dêh lu bơngai Môap, pơm yang Mơlek rup yang mă kơnê̆ dêh lu bơngai Ammôn."
"And he broke in pieces the sacred pillars and cut down the wooden images, and filled their places with the bones of men.","Sư teh pơchah lê̆ lu rup yang pơm păng tơmo, kăl tơpăk lê̆ gơ̆ng rup yang yă Asêra păng tuh pơlŭl lê̆ kơting bơngai tơ noh."
"Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he broke down; and he burned the high place and crushed it to powder, and burned the wooden image.","Sư kư̆m teh pơchah lê̆ chơnang soi tơ Pơlei Bethel păng hnam kơkuh kơ yang mă Jêrôbôam, kon drŏ-nglo Nêbat hlôi pơm, bơngai noh pơm kơ lu bơngai Isơrael pơm yoch; sư teh pơchah lê̆ chơnang soi, soh rŭk lê̆ Hnam kơkuh kơ yang tơ anih kơjung, teh pơhĕch lê̆ dĭng kơ'mey.

"As Josiah turned, he saw the tombs that were there on the mountain. And he sent and took the bones out of the tombs and burned them on the altar, and defiled it according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words.","Lăp Jôsia hue lăng, 'bôh hĭ lu bơsat tơ kơpal kông; na sư wơh bơngai năm iŏk kơting đơ̆ng lăm bơsat noh, đơ̆ng noh soh tơ kơpal chơnang soi, pơm kơ chơnang soi kơnê̆ 'mê̆-'mach thoi nơ̆r Kră Yang, mă đơ̆ng bơngai 'Bok Kei-Dei yua tơ'ngla mă roi tơbăt lê̆ adrol bơih kơ tơdrong noh."
"Then he said, “What gravestone is this that I see?” So the men of the city told him, “It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and proclaimed these things which you have done against the altar of Bethel.”","Đơ̆ng noh pơtao jet. “Bơsat to noh bơsat bu kih?” Lu bơngai lăm pơlei noh tơl: “'Noh bơsat bơngai 'Bok Kei-Dei yua, sư đơ̆ng char Juđa năm roi tơbăt lê̆ adrol gah tơdrong mă ih hlôi pơm 'nâu, wă blah chơnang soi tơ Bethel.”"
"And he said, “Let him alone; let no one move his bones.” So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet who came from Samaria.","Pơtao khan: “'Nĕ kơ iŏk kơting sư, lê̆ sư lăm noh bơih.” Na lu sư lê̆ kơting bơngai khan lê̆ adrol tơ noh, hơdai hăm kơting 'bok khan lê̆ adrol đơ̆ng Samari."
"Now Josiah also took away all the shrines of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the LORD to anger; and he did to them according to all the deeds he had done in Bethel.","Pơtao Jôsia kư̆m yuih lê̆ đĭ lu chơnang soi kơkuh kơ yang pơm tơ kơpal anih kơjung, tơ lăm lu pơlei tơring Samari, mă lu pơtao đe Isơrael hlôi pơm wă tơblĕk Kră Yang, sư teng pơchah lê̆ đĭ lu chơnang soi noh kư̆m thoi sư hlôi pơm bơih tơ Pơlei Bethel mơ̆n."
"He executed all the priests of the high places who were there, on the altars, and burned men’s bones on them; and he returned to Jerusalem.","Sư pơlôch lê̆ lu 'bok soi mă jang lăm anih yang pơm kơpal anih kơjung, sư pơlôch kơtă kơpal chơnang soi hloi, soh rŭk lê̆ kơting đe noh.

"Then the king commanded all the people, saying, “Keep the Passover to the LORD your God, as it is written in this Book of the Covenant.”","Na pơtao Jôsia tơtă athei đĭ-đăng lu kon pơlei: “Iĕm athei 'blŏk hơdơ̆r kơ năr giĕng Năm Brih kơ Kră Yang lu iĕm, kiơ̆ thoi dôm nơ̆r đei chih lăm sơ̆p hla bơar Kră Yang pơgơ̆p pơkă 'nâu.”"
"Such a Passover surely had never been held since the days of the judges who judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah.","Yua kơ lăm chăl lu 'bok sek tơlang lu bơngai Isơrael, mă lăm chăl lu pơtao đe Isơrael, mă chăl lu pơtao Juđa, lu sư tam mă biơh 'bôh pơm giĕng Năm Brih thoi noh."
"But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah this Passover was held before the LORD in Jerusalem.","Mă-lei lăm sơnăm mă mơjĭt-tơhngam, chăl pơtao Jôsia pơgơ̆r, lu sư đei pơm giĕng Năm Brih kơ Kră Yang tơ Pơlei Jêrusalem."
"Moreover Josiah put away those who consulted mediums and spiritists, the household gods and idols, all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD.","Jôsia kư̆m pơrăm pơpuh lê̆ đĭ lu bơngai pơjâu krao bơhngol bơngai lôch păng lu pơjâu tơwir, lu rup yang kơdih rim hnam păng lu rup yang hăm đĭ-đăng lu tơdrong kơnê̆ 'mê̆-'mach mă Kră Yang areh đei 'bôh lăm char Juđa păng tơ Pơlei Jêrusalem, wă pơm kiơ̆ kơjăp tơdrong juăt đei chih bơih lăm sơ̆p hla bơar mă 'bok soi Hilkia đei chă 'bôh đơ̆ng lăm hnam akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang."
"Now before him there was no king like him, who turned to the LORD with all his heart, with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the Law of Moses; nor after him did any arise like him.","Adrol kơ Jôsia ưh kơ đei minh 'nu pơtao ayơ thoi sư, 'mêm kơ Kră Yang đĭ jơhngơ̆m đĭ tơdrong tơchĕng đĭ tơdrong pran sư, pơm kiơ̆ tôm khôi juăt Môis păng đơ̆ng rŏng kơ sư kư̆m ưh kơ đei bu lei-lăi thoi sư."
"Nevertheless the LORD did not turn from the fierceness of His great wrath, with which His anger was aroused against Judah, because of all the provocations with which Manasseh had provoked Him.","Mă-lei, Kră Yang oei blĕk, Sư hil mĭl kơ lu bơngai Juđa ưh kơ hơi ôh, oei ơh blĕk yua kơ tơdrong yoch mă Manase oei pơm"
"And the LORD said, “I will also remove Judah from My sight, as I have removed Israel, and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I said, ‘My name shall be there.’ ”","Na Kră Yang khan: “Inh gô puh tơweh lê̆ lu bơngai Juđa đơ̆ng Inh, thoi Inh puh tơweh bơih lu bơngai Isơrael păng Inh gô pơrăm lê̆ Pơlei Jêrusalem mă Inh rơih bơih păng kư̆m pơrăm Hnam akŭm tơm mă Inh hlôi khan: Anăn Inh gô oei tơ noh.”"
"Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?","Dôm lu tơdrong hơ'mon nai gah Jôsia, đĭ-đăng lu tơdrong jang đêl sư pơm, đe đei chih lê̆ tơ lăm sơ̆p hla bơar tơdrong hơ'mon gah lu 'bok pơtao đe Juđa"
"In his days Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt went to the aid of the king of Assyria, to the River Euphrates; and King Josiah went against him. And Pharaoh Necho killed him at Megiddo when he confronted him.","Lăm chăl Jôsia pơgơ̆r, 'bok Pharaôn Nêkô, pơtao đe Êyiptơ năm tơ đak Krong Ơphrat, tơgŭm pơtao đe Asiri tơblah.

"Then his servants moved his body in a chariot from Megiddo, brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own tomb. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, anointed him, and made him king in his father’s place.","Lu đĭch đam sư chơ atâu sư lăm gre aseh đơ̆ng pơlei Mêgiđô brŏk tơ Pơlei Jêrusalem, đơ̆ng noh 'bŭ sư lăm bơsat sư kơdih.

"Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.","Kơplah Jêhôahas tŏk pơm pơtao, sư 'bar-jĭt pêng sơnăm; sư pơgơ̆r pêng khei lăm Pơlei Jêrusalem.

"And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.","Sư pơm tơdrong kơnê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, pơm lei-lăi tôm tơdrong thoi đêl lu 'bok sư pơm bơih sơ̆."
"Now Pharaoh Necho put him in prison at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and he imposed on the land a tribute of one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.","Pharaôn Nêkô chĭt kron lê̆ sư tơ Risla, lăm dêh Hamat wă kơ sư ưh kơ đei pơgơ̆r Pơlei Jêrusalem dơ̆ng.

"Then Pharaoh Necho made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in place of his father Josiah, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. And Pharaoh took Jehoahaz and went to Egypt, and he died there.","Na Pharaôn Nêkô pôk Êliakim kon drŏ-nglo Jôsia, pơm pơtao tơplih Jôsia 'bă sư. Păng tơplih Êliakim anăn sư jing Jêhôiakim. Na Jêhôahas pơtao Pharaôn Nekô rôp ba sư tơ Êyiptơ păng sư lôch tơ noh."
"So Jehoiakim gave the silver and gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give money according to the command of Pharaoh; he exacted the silver and gold from the people of the land, from every one according to his assessment, to give it to Pharaoh Necho.","Jêhôiakim ăn kơ Pharaôn Nêkô hu maih kiơ̆ thoi pơtao ei athei ăn, mă-lei sư hiơ̆k chă ra wă kơ tôm hu maih thoi Pharaôn Nêkô athei.

"Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zebudah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.","Kơplah Jêhôiakim tŏk pơm pơtao, sư 'bar-jĭt pơđăm sơnăm, păng sư pơgơ̆r mơjĭt-mônh sơnăm lăm Pơlei Jêrusalem.

"And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.","Sư pơm tơdrong kơnê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, pơm lei-lăi tôm tơdrong thoi đêl lu 'bok sư pơm boih sơ̆."
"In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his vassal for three years. Then he turned and rebelled against him.","Lăm chăl Jêhôiakim pơgơ̆r, Nebukatnessar, pơtao đe Babilôn, blah iŏk dêh char Juđa, Jêhôiakim chu jang kơ sư lăm pêng sơnăm, đơ̆ng noh sư tơplih đon tơchĕng sư iung blah pơtao đe Babilôn dơ̆ng."
"And the LORD sent against him raiding bands of Chaldeans, bands of Syrians, bands of Moabites, and bands of the people of Ammon; He sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the LORD which He had spoken by His servants the prophets.","Kră Yang ăn lu khŭl linh đe Kalđê, khŭl linh đe Asiri, păng khŭl linh đe Môap năm blah pơrăm char Juđa, wă khŭl linh đe Ammôn pơrăm lê̆ lu sư, kiơ̆ thoi nơ̆r Kră Yang yua nơ̆r lu bơngai khan lê̆ adrol, noh jơ̆ lu đĭch đam sư"
"Surely at the commandment of the LORD this came upon Judah, to remove them from His sight because of the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he had done","Tơdrong răm 'nâu truh hloi kơ lu bơngai Juđa yua kơ đơ̆ng nơ̆r Kră Yang tơtă wă tơhiong lê̆ lu sư đơ̆ng anăp Kră Yang, yua kơ đêl tơdrong yoch Manase, kiơ̆ thoi tơdrong sư đei pơm"
"and also because of the innocent blood that he had shed; for he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, which the LORD would not pardon.","Păng yua kơ sư pơlôch pham lĕch đơ̆ng lu bơngai ưh kơ đei yoch; yua kơ sư hlôi pơm kơ Pơlei Jêrusalem 'bĕnh kơ pham lu bơngai ưh kơ đei yoch, lei na Kră Yang ưh kơ mơnat kơ sư ôh."
"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?","Dôm lu tơdrong hơ'mon nai gah Jêhôiakim, đĭ-đăng lu tơdrong jang đêl sư pơm, đe đei chih lê̆ bơih tơ lăm sơ̆p hla bơar hơ'mon gah lu pơtao."
"So Jehoiakim rested with his fathers. Then Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place.","Jêhôiakim lôch, tep hiôk hăm lu 'bok kơdră sư păng Jêhôiachin kon drŏ-nglo sư, pơm pơtao pơtrơp sư."
"And the king of Egypt did not come out of his land anymore, for the king of Babylon had taken all that belonged to the king of Egypt from the Brook of Egypt to the River Euphrates.","Pơtao đe Êyiptơ ưh kơ pơ̆n lĕch jăk đơ̆ng dêh char sư kơdih, yua kơ pơtao đe Babilôn tơgar iŏk bơih dêh char sư pơgơ̆r noh, đơ̆ng đak glung Êyiptơ truh tơ đak krong Ơphrat."
"Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. His mother’s name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.","Jêhôiachin sư mơjĭt-tơhngam sơnăm kơplah sư tŏk pơm pơtao; sư pơgơ̆r pêng khei tơ lăm Pơlei Jêrusalem.

"And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father had done.","Jêhôiachin pơm tơdrong kơnê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang pơm kiơ̆ tôm tơdrong thoi đêl 'bă sư pơm."
"At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.","Kơplah noh lu linh Nebukatnessar, pơtao đe Babilôn bơ̆ teh wă tŏk blah Pơlei Jêrusalem."
"And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, as his servants were besieging it.","Nebukatnessar pơtao dêh Babilôn kư̆m năm truh tơ pơlei, kơplah lu linh sư wă tŏk blah pơlei noh."
"Then Jehoiachin king of Judah, his mother, his servants, his princes, and his officers went out to the king of Babylon; and the king of Babylon, in the eighth year of his reign, took him prisoner.","Na Jêhôiachin, pơtao đe Juđa, lu sư đe mĕ sư, đĭch đam sư, lu yŏng linh lu 'bok tih linh, năm kŭp kơ̆l yơ̆r ti kơ pơtao đe Babilôn.

"And he carried out from there all the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king’s house, and he cut in pieces all the articles of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said.","Thoi nơ̆r Kră Yang hlôi khan, pơtao Babilôn iŏk lê̆ đĭ dôm lu tơmam kăp đơ̆ng lăm hnam akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang păng dôm lu tơmam gĭt đơ̆ng lăm hnam pơtao, teng iŏk lu tơmam yua lăm hnam akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang mă Sôlômôn pơtao đe Isơrael hlôi pơm hăm maih."
"Also he carried into captivity all Jerusalem: all the captains and all the mighty men of valor, ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths. None remained except the poorest people of the land.","Pơtao chông ba đĭ-đăng lu bơngai gơh hơgei lăm Pơlei Jêrusalem, sư kư̆m rôp đĭ-đăng lu thơ̆ hơgei gơh hơjơ̆m đĭ-đăng lu 'bok tih păng lu linh tơblah nuih kơtang, đĭ-đăng lu sư mơjĭt-rơbâu 'nu.

"And he carried Jehoiachin captive to Babylon. The king’s mother, the king’s wives, his officers, and the mighty of the land he carried into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.","Sư, chông ba Jêhôiachin tơ Babilôn; sư kư̆m rôp ba mĕ pơtao lu akăn pơtao lu kuan tih, lu bơngai yŏng mơng lăm char, sư chông ba đơ̆ng Pơlei Jêrusalem năm pơm bơnă tơ Pơlei Babilôn."
"All the valiant men, seven thousand, and craftsmen and smiths, one thousand, all who were strong and fit for war, these the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.","Pơtao Nebukatnessar chông ba lu linh tơblah nuih kơtang, đĭ-đăng lu sư tơpơh-rơbâu 'nu păng minh-rơbâu lu thơ̆ hơgei gơh pơm."
"Then the king of Babylon made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin’s uncle, king in his place, and changed his name to Zedekiah.","Na pơtao Babilôn pôk ăn kơ Mathania tŏk pơm pơtao tơplih Jêhôiachin. Mathania noh sư ma Jêhôiachin, tơplih ăn kơ sư anăn plơ̆ng krao Sêđekia dơ̆ng."
"Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.","Sêđekia sư 'bar-jĭt mônh sơnăm kơplah sư tŏk pơm pơtao păng sư pơgơ̆r mơjĭt-mônh sơnăm tơ lăm Pơlei Jêrusalem.

"He also did evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.","Sư pơm tơdrong kơnê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang păng pơm kiơ̆ dôm tơdrong Jêhôiakim hlôi pơm sơ̆."
"For because of the anger of the LORD this happened in Jerusalem and Judah, that He finally cast them out from His presence. Then Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.","Tơdrong Kră Yang hil mĭl Sư ăn truh bơih kơ Pơlei Jêrusalem păng dêh Juđa, Kră Yang mah puh tơweh lê̆ lu sư đơ̆ng muh măt Kră Yang. Na Sêđekia iung blah pơtao đe Babilôn."
"Now it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem and encamped against it; and they built a siege wall against it all around.","Lăm sơnăm mă tơsĭn, chăl Sêđekia pơgơ̆r, lăm năr mơjĭt, khei mơjĭt, Nebukatnessar, pơtao đe Babilôn chông đĭ-đăng lu linh sư năm blah Pơlei Jêrusalem.

"So the city was besieged until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.","Lu sư wang pơlei noh đunh dĭng truh tơ sơnăm mă mơjĭt-mônh, chăl pơtao Sêđekia pơgơ̆r."
"By the ninth day of the fourth month the famine had become so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land.","Năr tơsĭn, khei puăn, lăm pơlei đei pơngot rơwĕt tih, kon pơlei ưh kơ đei tơmam sa."
"Then the city wall was broken through, and all the men of war fled at night by way of the gate between two walls, which was by the king’s garden, even though the Chaldeans were still encamped all around against the city. And the king went by way of the plain.","Kơplah noh, lu linh đe Kalđê bŏk dur pơlei minh pôm bơlôh kơplah kơmăng, pơtao Juđa păng đĭ-đăng lu linh kơdâu klĕnh trong 'măng jang sơlam 'bar pah dur, jê̆ pơgar pơtao.

"But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and they overtook him in the plains of Jericho. All his army was scattered from him.","Mă-lei đei khŭl linh đe Kalđê druh 'moi 'bok pơtao, lu sư druh tam đei rôp pơtao tơ tơmăn glă pơlei Jêrikô; đĭ-đăng lu linh sư tơklah tơklang păng achăng lê̆ sư hơdrô̆."
"So they took the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah, and they pronounced judgment on him.","Lu linh đe Kalđê rôp pơtao đe Sêđekia anhăk ba sư tơ pơtao đe Babilôn oei tơ Ribla; tơ noh lu sư sek tơlang pơtao."
"Then they killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, put out the eyes of Zedekiah, bound him with bronze fetters, and took him to Babylon.","Lu sư pơlôch kon drŏ-nglo pơtao Sêđekia tơm măt; na kuek lê̆ măt Sêđekia, chô̆ lê̆ sư hăm glang pơm hăm kong, đơ̆ng noh ba sư tơ Babilôn."
"And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month (which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.","Năr tơpơh, khei pơđăm sơnăm mơjĭt-tơsĭn, chăl Nebukatnessar, pơtao đe Babilôn pơgơ̆r, Nêbusarađan, Yŏng linh pơtao đe Babilôn năm tơ Pơlei Jêrusalem."
"He burned the house of the LORD and the king’s house; all the houses of Jerusalem, that is, all the houses of the great, he burned with fire.","Sư soh hnam akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang, soh hnam pơtao păng lu hnam lăm Pơlei Jêrusalem; kư̆m soh lê̆ hnam tih lu yŏng mơng lăm pơlei."
"And all the army of the Chaldeans who were with the captain of the guard broke down the walls of Jerusalem all around.","Đĭ-đăng khŭl linh đe Kalđê chu nơ̆r 'bok tih linh, lu sư teh pơchah dur war tăp Pơlei Jêrusalem."
"Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive the rest of the people who remained in the city and the defectors who had deserted to the king of Babylon, with the rest of the multitude.","Nêbusarađan, yŏng wei linh pơtao rôp kon pơlei mă oei oei lăm pơlei păng lu bơngai mă hlôi kŭp kơ̆l yơ̆r ti kơ pơtao Babilôn bơih, lu bơngai hơgei hai dơ̆ng, lu sư ba pơđĭ phak tơ dêh char sư."
"But the captain of the guard left some of the poor of the land as vinedressers and farmers.","Mă-lei yŏng linh lê̆ doh oei pă pôm lu bơngai dơnuh hin ngei ngei lăm char wă kơ lu sư pơtăm 'long hơmu păng jang chŭn mir."
"The bronze pillars that were in the house of the LORD, and the carts and the bronze Sea that were in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke in pieces, and carried their bronze to Babylon.","Lu linh đe Kalđê teh pơchah, jrăng pơm hăm kong, bơng đak đe pơm hăm kong tơ lăm Hnam akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang, đơ̆ng noh chĕp ba tơmam kong tơ Pơlei Babilôn."
"They also took away the pots, the shovels, the trimmers, the spoons, and all the bronze utensils with which the priests ministered.","Lu sư kư̆m iŏk ba lu gŏ kong, chơ'mŏng gơ'bênh, săng kăt brai ŭnh kơđeng, pơnhan păng đĭ lu tơmam pơm hăm kong wă răk yua lăm hnam kơkuh kơ Kră Yang."
"The firepans and the basins, the things of solid gold and solid silver, the captain of the guard took away.","Yŏng linh kư̆m iŏk ba lu ge wă soh tơmam 'bâu phu, pơnhan mong đak rơmă 'bâu phu kơthao păng dôm lu tơmam pơm hăm hu maih"
"The two pillars, one Sea, and the carts, which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD, the bronze of all these articles was beyond measure.","Na 'bar tŏ jrăng kong, bơng đak pơm hăm kong, păng dôm lu 'long tơjră hăm kong tơmam mă Sôlômôn pơm lăm Hnam akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang, ưh kơ đei bu gơh kŏng, gơh jô̆ kơsô̆ kong đơ̆ng lăm dôm tơmam."
"The height of one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the capital on it was of bronze. The height of the capital was three cubits, and the network and pomegranates all around the capital were all of bronze. The second pillar was the same, with a network.","Jrăng minh pôm, kơjung sư mơjĭt-tơhngam hơgăt, kơpal jrăng ei đei kơ̆l jrăng đe pơm hăm kong, noh kơjung sư pơđăm hơgăt, đe pơm tơkon hơdrao pơ̆n tăp dăr, păng plei gărnăt kư̆m pơm hăm kong mơ̆n.

"And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the second priest, and the three doorkeepers.","Yŏng linh rôp 'bok soi tơm anăn sư Sêraja, 'bok soi kơiĕng anăn sư Sôphôni păng pêng 'nu bơngai gak 'măng hnam akŭm."
"He also took out of the city an officer who had charge of the men of war, five men of the king’s close associates who were found in the city, the chief recruiting officer of the army, who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the city.","Sư kư̆m rôp 'bok tih mă wei-lăng lu linh, rôp pơđăm 'nu lăm lu bơngai tơgŭm pơtao chă đon, rôp bơngai mă jang hla bơar, sư bơngai mă hiơ̆k tơdrong mă krao akŭm lu bơngai lăm char sư păng rôp hloi tơdrâu-jĭt 'nu bơngai tơgŭm oei lăm pơlei ei."
"So Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, took these and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.","Yŏng linh anăn sư Nêbusarađan rôp anhăk ba đĭ-đăng lu bơngai noh tơ pơtao đe Babilôn oei tơ Ribla."
"Then the king of Babylon struck them and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive from its own land.","Pơtao đe Babilôn teh pơlôch lu đe noh tơ lăm Pơlei Riblah, lăm dêh Hamat. Noh đe rôp ba lu bơngai Juđa pơm bơnă tơ 'nguaih kơ dêh char sư."
"Then he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, governor over the people who remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left.","Bê̆ gah lu bơngai Juđa mă Nebukatnessar pơtao Babilôn oei lê̆ lăm dêh char Juđa, na pơtao đe Babilôn jao kơ Gêđalia, kon drŏ-nglo Ahikam, Saphan, pơm tih pơgơ̆r lu sư."
"Now when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah—Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, Johanan the son of Careah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.","Kơplah lu đe yŏng linh anăn lu sư Ismael, kon drŏ-nglo Nêthania, Jôhanan, kon drŏ-nglo 'bok Karêat, Sêraja, kon drŏ-nglo Tanhumet oei tơ pơlei Nêtôpat păng Jaasania kon drŏ-nglo Makathit păng lu linh đe ei kơtơ̆ng pơtao đe Babilôn, jao kơ Gêđalia pơm 'bok tih pơgơ̆r, na lu sư năm tơ Gêđalia tơ Pơlei Mispa."
"And Gedaliah took an oath before them and their men, and said to them, “Do not be afraid of the servants of the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.”","Gêđalia pơkă pơkăm hăm lu sư păng hăm lu linh lu sư khan: “'Nĕ kơ hli kơ lu yŏng Kalđê!

"But it happened in the seventh month that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal family, came with ten men and struck and killed Gedaliah, the Jews, as well as the Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah.","Lăm khei tơpơh Ismael, kon drŏ-nglo Nêthania, sâu Êlisama, sư gah adrĕch pơtao, sư năm tơ Pơlei Mispa, đei mơjĭt 'nu bơngai kiơ̆ sư blah Gêđalia păng pơlôch lê̆ sư hăm lu bơngai Juđa păng lu bơngai Kalđê mă oei hăm sư tơ Pơlei Mispa."
"And all the people, small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose and went to Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.","Na đĭ-đăng lu kon pơlei đơ̆ng 'lơ̆p truh tơ 'lŏ, păng lu 'bok kuan tih, iung jăk tơ dêh Êyiptơ; yua kơ lu sư hli lu bơngai Kalđê iung kơting."
"Now it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, that Evil-Merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, released Jehoiachin king of Judah from prison.","Lăm sơnăm mă pêng-jĭt tơpơh, jô̆ đơ̆ng sơnăm đe rôp phak Jêhôiachin pơtao đe Juđa.

"He spoke kindly to him, and gave him a more prominent seat than those of the kings who were with him in Babylon.","Pơtao đe Babilôn pơma hăm Jêhôiakin nơ̆r rơngơp hiôk, gơh găt, păng pôk atŏk ăn tang-dŏ sư kơjung hloh sư lu pơtao nai mă oei phak hơdai hăm sư tơ Babilôn."
"So Jehoiachin changed from his prison garments, and he ate bread regularly before the king all the days of his life.","Na Jêhôiachin plôh lê̆ ao bơnă sư păng rim năr oei sŏng sa pôm gơ'bang hăm pơtao dĭng đĭ chăl arih sư."
"And as for his provisions, there was a regular ration given him by the king, a portion for each day, all the days of his life.","Pơtao đe Babilôn tơgŭm sư tơmam sa mah ling-lang dĭng đĭ chăl arih sư."
