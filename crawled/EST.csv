"Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus (this was the Ahasuerus who reigned over one hundred and twenty-seven provinces, from India to Ethiopia)","chăl pơtao Asêrus, sư pơgơ̆r lăm minh-hrĕng 'bar-jĭt tơpơh tŏ char iŏk đơ̆ng char Ânđô̆ truh tơ Êthiôpi."
"in those days when King Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the citadel","Kơplah pơtao Asêrus pơgơ̆r sư oei lăm pơlei tih Susa."
"that in the third year of his reign he made a feast for all his officials and servants—the powers of Persia and Media, the nobles, and the princes of the provinces being before him","Lăm sơnăm mă pêng chăl sư pơgơ̆r, sư pơih sŏng sa tih, sư krao wơ̆n lu kră pơgơ̆r wei-lăng tơring păng lu yŏng linh char Phersia hăm Mêdi năm 'bơ̆t anăp sư."
"when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the splendor of his excellent majesty for many days, one hundred and eighty days in all.","Lăm đunh năr wă khan minh-hrĕng tơhngam-jĭt năr, sư pơdah tơdrong 'lơ̆ng rŏ hơbŏ sor sư."
"And when these days were completed, the king made a feast lasting seven days for all the people who were present in Shushan the citadel, from great to small, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ lu năr noh hlôi boih, pơtao krao đĭ-đăng lu kon pơlei mă oei lăm pơlei tih Susa, mă pơm tih, pơm iĕ sŏng sa lăm tơpơh năr tơ anih lăm pơgar pơkao sư."
"There were white and blue linen curtains fastened with cords of fine linen and purple on silver rods and marble pillars; and the couches were of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of alabaster, turquoise, and white and black marble.","Tăp dăr kơ pơgar đei dăng che kok, che dreng hla 'long, dreng jơk plĕnh, iŏk tơlei kok păng 'brê hơhĭm chô̆ tơ kong hu păng jrăng tơmo brông, lu giơng pơm păng hu maih, dan kơpal hơnă lơ̆k tơmo gôh kok păng tơmo rang gĭt găm."
"And they served drinks in golden vessels, each vessel being different from the other, with royal wine in abundance, according to the generosity of the king.","Lu sư huch sa păng kơchŏk maih, đei lơ kơchŏk phara pha, đei tơdrô lơ trŏ kơ tơdrong mơdrŏng pơtao."
"In accordance with the law, the drinking was not compulsory; for so the king had ordered all the officers of his household, that they should do according to each man’s pleasure.","Tơdrong huch sa kiơ̆ thoi ưh kơ đei bu pơgŏ ôh, yua kơ pơtao pơkă boih kơ lu bơngai mă bơ̆jang lăm hnam pơtao ăn kon pơlei huch sa mơ̆ng kiơ̆ kơ akâu kơdih wă."
"Queen Vashti also made a feast for the women in the royal palace which belonged to King Ahasuerus.","Yă pơtao Wathi kư̆m hơmet sŏng sa tih ăn kơ lu bơngai drŏ-kăn tơ lăm hnam pơtao Asêrus."
"On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, seven eunuchs who served in the presence of King Ahasuerus","Truh lăm năr mă tơpơh jơhngơ̆m pơtao hiôk dêh đơ̆ng huch tơdrô na sư pơkă kơ Mêhuman, Bistha, Harbôna, Biktha, Abaktha, Sethar păng Karkas. Tơpơh 'nu linh krĕo bơ̆jang lăm hnam pơtao Asêrus"
"to bring Queen Vashti before the king, wearing her royal crown, in order to show her beauty to the people and the officials, for she was beautiful to behold.","chông yă pơtao Wathi năm 'bơ̆t anăp pơtao, pơyơ̆l ăn kơ sư môk pơtao, wă tơ'bôh ăn tơdrong 'lơ̆ng sư kơ kon pơlei pơla păng kơ lu kuan tih lăng, yua kơ akâu sư hơbŏ 'lơ̆ng dêh."
"But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s command brought by his eunuchs; therefore the king was furious, and his anger burned within him.","Mă-lei yă pơtao Wathi ưh kơ wă chu nơ̆r pơtao tơtă đơ̆ng lu linh krĕo khan, yua kơ tơdrong noh na pơtao blĕk dêh tơtŏ lăm jơhngơ̆m sư."
"Then the king said to the wise men who understood the times (for this was the king’s manner toward all who knew law and justice","Pơtao mưh sư đei tơdrong truh sư juăt kơ apinh lu bơngai hơgei lu bơngai băt tơdrong juăt păng băt kơ sek tơlang."
"those closest to him being Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who had access to the king’s presence, and who ranked highest in the kingdom)","Na sư apinh lu kuan tih oei jê̆ sư Karsena, Sethan, Atmatha, Tarsis, Mêdi, Marsena păng Memukan, tơpơh 'nu kuan tih Phersia păng Mêre, lu đe âu juăt kơ 'bôh pơtao păng lu sư hơ-oei 'bơ̆t anih kơjung hloh kơ đĭ-đăng."
"“What shall we do to Queen Vashti, according to law, because she did not obey the command of King Ahasuerus brought to her by the eunuchs?”","Sư apinh thoi âu: Yă pơtao Wathi ưh kơ chu nơ̆r pơtao Asêrus tơtă kơ lu linh krĕo thoi noh kiơ̆ tơdrong juăt lu bơ̆n wă sek tơdrong thoi yơ?"
"And Memucan answered before the king and the princes: “Queen Vashti has not only wronged the king, but also all the princes, and all the people who are in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus.","Mêmukan tơl 'bơ̆t anăp pơtao păng lu kuan tih thoi âu: Yă pơtao Wathi âu ưh kơ sĭ pơm hơdrô̆ ih đĕch ôh ưh kơ hiôk, mă-lei kư̆m pơm kơ đĭ-đăng lu kuan tih păng đĭ-đăng kon pơlei oei lăm char pơtao Asêrus pơgơ̆r."
"For the queen’s behavior will become known to all women, so that they will despise their husbands in their eyes, when they report, ‘King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought in before him, but she did not come.’","Yua kơ đĭ-đăng bơngai drŏ-kăn gô kơtơ̆ng tơdrong yă pơtao Wathi pơm na lu sư kư̆m ưh kơ wă chu klo lu sư kơdih, yua kơ lu sư khan, pơtao Asêrus tơtă nơ̆r sư krao yă pơtao Wathi năm 'bơ̆t anăp sư ră, mă-lei yă pơtao noh ưh kơ chu năm."
"This very day the noble ladies of Persia and Media will say to all the king’s officials that they have heard of the behavior of the queen. Thus there will be excessive contempt and wrath.","Năr 'nâu akăn lu 'bok kuan tih lăm char Phersia păng char Mêdi gô kơtơ̆ng kơ tơdrong yă pơtao Wathi đei pơm, lu sư kư̆m gô pơma kơ lu klo sư thoi noh đơ̆ng noh gô đei lơ tơdrong hil păng pơdê."
"If it pleases the king, let a royal decree go out from him, and let it be recorded in the laws of the Persians and the Medes, so that it will not be altered, that Vashti shall come no more before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal position to another who is better than she.","Tơdah pơtao lăp đon, lei tơjur bĕ nơ̆r pơtao pơkă, na chih lăm sơ̆p hla bơar tơdrong juăt dêh char Phersia păng char Mêdi wă ưh kơ đei bu gơh tơplih, wă kơ yă pơtao Wathi âu ưh pă gơh mơ̆t 'bơ̆t anăp pơtao Asêrus. Pơtao athei rơih chă yă pơtao plơ̆ng 'lơ̆ng hloh tơplih kơ yă Wathi."
"When the king’s decree which he will make is proclaimed throughout all his empire (for it is great), all wives will honor their husbands, both great and small.”","Thoi noh tơdah layơ nơ̆r pơtao noh đei roi tơbăt tơ jơ̆p-jang lăm teh đak ih, mă să păng tih dêh, lei na đĭ-đăng lu drŏ-kăn gô chu yom kơ klo lu sư, mă mơdrŏng yŏng mơng truh tơ bơngai pă rơ-a."
"And the reply pleased the king and the princes, and the king did according to the word of Memucan.","Pơtao păng lu kuan tih lăp đon kơ tơdrong pơđâu 'nâu pơtao pơm kiơ̆ hloi nơ̆r Memukan pơđâu."
"Then he sent letters to all the king’s provinces, to each province in its own script, and to every people in their own language, that each man should be master in his own house, and speak in the language of his own people.","Sư tơjur nơ̆r chih ăn kơ đĭ-đăng char lăm dêh char sư pơgơ̆r kiơ̆ kơ nơ̆r pơma lăm rim tơring, wă kơ rim 'nu drŏ-nglo jing pơm yŏng tơ'ngla lăm hnam dơnŏ sư kơdih, yua nơ̆r sư kơdih chă bơtho tơ'bôh."
"After these things, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus subsided, he remembered Vashti, what she had done, and what had been decreed against her.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ dôm tơdrong noh, pơtao Asêrus huay pă blĕk boih na sư 'blŏk dơ̆ng kơ yă Wathi, tơdrong đêl yă Wathi pơm păng tơdrong sư đei tơjur nơ̆r tơtă wă pơm kơ yă Wathi."
"Then the king’s servants who attended him said: “Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king","Lu pơm kuan tih oei jê̆ pơtao lu sư khan: Khŏm chă kơ ih hơdruh hle 'lơ̆ng guăng."
"and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather all the beautiful young virgins to Shushan the citadel, into the women’s quarters, under the custody of Hegai the king’s eunuch, custodian of the women. And let beauty preparations be given them.","Apinh ih rơih chă lu kuan lăm rim tơring lăm dêh char ih pơgơ̆r wă chă akŭm đĭ-đăng lu hơdruh 'lơ̆ng guăng năm ba tơ pơlei tih Susa jao ăn kơ Hêgai linh krĕo bơngai mă juăt kơ wei-lăng lu akăn kơnhŏng pơtao, na athei asong pơgang 'bâu phu kơ lu sư wă pik."
"Then let the young woman who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.” This thing pleased the king, and he did so.","Ăn hơdruh ayơ pơtao lăp đon, pơjing pôk sư pơm yă pơtao tơplih kơ yă Wathi. Nơ̆r noh pơtao lăp đon, na sư pơm hloi thoi noh."
"In Shushan the citadel there was a certain Jew whose name was Mordecai the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite.","Lăm pơlei Susa, đei minh 'nu bơngai Juđa anăn sư Morđêkai kon drŏ-nglo Jair sâu tơm Simei sâu i Kis bơngai Bênjamin"
"Kish had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been captured with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.","bơngai mă đe chông đơ̆ng pơlei Jêrusalem pơm bơnă hơdai hăm Jêkônia pơtao Juđa kư̆m đơ̆ng Nebukatnessar pơtao đe Babilôn rôp."
"And Mordecai had brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter, for she had neither father nor mother. The young woman was lovely and beautiful. When her father and mother died, Mordecai took her as his own daughter.","Morđêkai rong ba Hadasah, kư̆m krao anăn sư Esther, kon hơdruh ma sư, akâu sư hơbŏ 'lơ̆ng. Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ mĕ 'bă sư lôch boih. Morđêkai iŏk rong ba pơm jing kon hơdruh sư kơdih."
"So it was, when the king’s command and decree were heard, and when many young women were gathered at Shushan the citadel, under the custody of Hegai, that Esther also was taken to the king’s palace, into the care of Hegai the custodian of the women.","Thoi noh kơplah đe đei roi tơbăt nơ̆r đơ̆ng pơtao tơtă păng đei lu hơdruh akŭm tơ lăm pơlei Susa pơjao ăn kơ Hêgai wei-lăng Esther đe kư̆m ba truh tơ hnam pơtao na kư̆m jao ăn kơ Hêgai wei-lăng."
"Now the young woman pleased him, and she obtained his favor; so he readily gave beauty preparations to her, besides her allowance. Then seven choice maidservants were provided for her from the king’s palace, and he moved her and her maidservants to the best place in the house of the women.","Bơngai hơdruh mơlôh noh Hêgai lăp đon păng lăng mơnat; sư thar ăn hloi pơgang 'bâu phu wă pik păng ăn dôm tơmam kăl yua hăm tơmam sa. Păng kư̆m chă ăn tơpơh 'nu hơdruh 'lơ̆ng hơbŏ nai dơ̆ng lăm hnam pơtao, wă awih awăn kơ sư đơ̆ng noh ăn kơ sư năm hăm lu hơdruh noh. Lu sư năm oei tơ anih 'lơ̆ng hloh kơ lu hơdruh nai oei."
"Esther had not revealed her people or family, for Mordecai had charged her not to reveal it.","Esther ưh kơ đei roi kơ bu băt ôh adrĕch sư, hăm lu kon pơlei sư yua kơ Morđêkai pơkă kơ sư 'nĕ roi kơ bu băt."
"And every day Mordecai paced in front of the court of the women’s quarters, to learn of Esther’s welfare and what was happening to her.","Rim năr Morđêkai năm tơ cham hnam lu hơdruh, wă kơ băt kơ Esther sư thoi yơ."
"Each young woman’s turn came to go in to King Ahasuerus after she had completed twelve months’ preparation, according to the regulations for the women, for thus were the days of their preparation apportioned: six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with perfumes and preparations for beautifying women.","Adrol kơ lu hơdruh wă năm tơ anăp pơtao Asêrus, athei iŏk pơgang pik wă kơ rơgoh 'lơ̆ng lăm mơjĭt-'bar khei: Tơdrâu khei pik đak 'long 'bâu phu.

"Thus prepared, each young woman went to the king, and she was given whatever she desired to take with her from the women’s quarters to the king’s palace.","Sư mơ̆t tơ anih pơtao thoi âu: Kiơ̆ kơ rim 'nu lu sư wă chĕp ba tơmam kiơ kăl yua, đe ăn đơ̆ng hnam lu bơngai drŏ-kăn."
"In the evening she went, and in the morning she returned to the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch who kept the concubines. She would not go in to the king again unless the king delighted in her and called for her by name.","Kơmăng adruh ei năm, pơgê hrôih drôih brŏk tơ hnam lu drŏ-kăn mă 'bar anih Sigas linh krĕo bơ̆jang kơ pơtao wei-lăng lu akăn kơnhŏng pơtao.

"Now when the turn came for Esther the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her as his daughter, to go in to the king, she requested nothing but what Hegai the king’s eunuch, the custodian of the women, advised. And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all who saw her.","Truh kơ jơ Esther kon hơdruh Abihai ma kơ Morđêkai, bơngai rong sư pơm jing kon kơdih sư, mơ̆t năm tơ anih pơtao, hơdruh noh ưh kơ đei wă apinh tơdrong kiơ, sư apinh pôm tơmam đơ̆ng Hêgai bơngai linh krĕo jang kơ pơtao wei-lăng lu hơdruh, tơ'bôh kơ sư. Esther đei lơ bơngai lăng sư mơnat."
"So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus, into his royal palace, in the tenth month, which is the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.","Đe ba Esther năm mơ̆t lăm anih pơtao Asêrus lăm khei mơjĭt (khei Têbet) lăm sơnăm tăl mă tơpơh sư pơgơ̆r."
"The king loved Esther more than all the other women, and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins; so he set the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.","Pơtao 'mêm kơ Esther hloh kơ lu đe hơdruh nai, 'bơ̆t anăp pơtao lăng sư mơnat hloh kơ lu đe hơdruh nai, na pơyơ̆l ăn kơ sư môk pơtao tơ kơ̆l sư, pôk sư jing yă pơtao tơplih kơ yă Wathi."
"Then the king made a great feast, the Feast of Esther, for all his officials and servants; and he proclaimed a holiday in the provinces and gave gifts according to the generosity of a king.","Đơ̆ng noh pơtao pơih sŏng sa tih, krao lu kuan tih păng lu yŏng pơgơ̆r, hăm asong ăn đĕch tơmam kơ kon pơlei păng pơtao kư̆m tơjur thuê̆ lăp ai ăn kơ rim tơring."
"When virgins were gathered together a second time, Mordecai sat within the king’s gate.","Kơplah lu đe hơdruh akŭm mă 'bar, Morđêkai hơ-oei ngôi 'bơ̆t 'măng jang pơtao."
"Now Esther had not revealed her family and her people, just as Mordecai had charged her, for Esther obeyed the command of Mordecai as when she was brought up by him.","Esther pơm kiơ̆ kơ nơ̆r Morđêkai pơkă kơ sư, ưh kơ đei roi kơ bu băt pơlei păng adrĕch sư; yua kơ sư chu kiơ̆ kơ nơ̆r Morđêkai thoi sư oei lăm hnam dơnŏ sư sơ̆."
"In those days, while Mordecai sat within the king’s gate, two of the king’s eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh, doorkeepers, became furious and sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus.","Kơplah năr Morđêkai hơ-oei ngôi 'bơ̆t 'măng jang pơtao đei 'bar 'nu kuan gak trong 'măng tơm pơtao, anăn bre sư Bikthan păng Têres, bre sư hil kơ pơtao Asêrus păng chă đon wă pơlôch pơtao."
"So the matter became known to Mordecai, who told Queen Esther, and Esther informed the king in Mordecai’s name.","Morđêkai băt tơdrong noh na sư roi ăn kơ yă pơtao Esther. Yă Esther băt đơ̆ng Morđêkai na sư roi ăn kơ pơtao băt, khan sư kơtơ̆ng đơ̆ng Morđêkai."
"And when an inquiry was made into the matter, it was confirmed, and both were hanged on a gallows; and it was written in the book of the chronicles in the presence of the king.","Đe chă apinh lăng tơdrong noh trŏ thoi ei tơpă na đe chô̆ atol hơko bre sư tơ 'long gơ̆ng kơjung. Tơdrong noh đe đei chih răk lăm sơ̆p hla bơar hơ'mon tơdrong jang pơtao, 'bơ̆t anăp pơtao."
"After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him and set his seat above all the princes who were with him.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ tơdrong noh pơtao Asêrus pôk Haman bơngai Agak, kon drŏ-nglo Hamedatha, pơm tih hloh kơ đĭ-đăng lu kuan jang lăm hnam pơtao."
"And all the king’s servants who were within the king’s gate bowed and paid homage to Haman, for so the king had commanded concerning him. But Mordecai would not bow or pay homage.","Đĭ-đăng lu bơngai jang lăm anih pơtao ngôi 'bơ̆t 'măng dur pơtao lu sư wang drap kơkuh, kơkuh kơ Haman yua kơ pơtao pơkă thoi noh, mă-lei Morđêkai ưh kơ kơkuh ôh."
"Then the king’s servants who were within the king’s gate said to Mordecai, “Why do you transgress the king’s command?”","Lu bơngai jang lăm anih pơtao khan kơ Morđêkai. Liơ ih ưh kơ chu, kuă kiơ̆ nơ̆r pơtao pơkă?"
"Now it happened, when they spoke to him daily and he would not listen to them, that they told it to Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s words would stand; for Mordecai had told them that he was a Jew.","Lu sư khan kơ Morđêkai rim năr, mă-lei sư ưh kơ wă mơ̆ng ôh. Lu sư roi ăn kơ Haman băt, lu sư wă gô lăng Morđêkai pơm thoi noh hăm jei sư ưh; yua kơ sư roi kơ lu sư khan sư bơngai Juđa."
"When Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow or pay him homage, Haman was filled with wrath.","Kơplah Haman 'bôh Morđêkai ưh kơ drap kơkuh kơ sư, sư blĕk dêh."
"But he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had told him of the people of Mordecai. Instead, Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus—the people of Mordecai.","Haman băt kơ sư bơngai Juđa, sư khan ưh kơ sĭ sư wă pơlôch pôm Morđêkai đĕch ôh sư wă pơlôch đĭ adrĕch adrung Juđa, oei lăm jơ̆p-jang pơlei lăm dêh char pơtao Asêrus pơgơ̆r."
"In the first month, which is the month of Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur (that is, the lot), before Haman to determine the day and the month, until it fell on the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar.","Lăm khei mônh, khei Nisan, lăm sơnăm mơjĭt-'bar chăl pơtao Asêrus đe dan lê̆ Pur 'bơ̆t anăp Haman wă kơ băt năr păng khei ayơ trŏ kơ pơm kơ lu bơngai Juđa. Lu sư dan lê̆ khŏm khŏm na trŏ kơ khei mơjĭt-'bar, khei Adar."
"Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a certain people scattered and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of your kingdom; their laws are different from all other people’s, and they do not keep the king’s laws. Therefore it is not fitting for the king to let them remain.","Haman khan kơ pơtao Asêrus thoi âu: Đei minh adrĕch adrung kơnê̆ dêh oei tơrak 'brak lăm lu kon pơlei ih tơ jơ̆p-jang tơring ih pơgơ̆r, tơdrong juăt lu sư phara hloh kơ lu adrĕch nai, na lu sư kư̆m ưh wă kiơ̆ tơdrong juăt ih tơtă, lê̆ lu sư arih kư̆m ưh kơ đei yua kiơ kơ ih."
"If it pleases the king, let a decree be written that they be destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who do the work, to bring it into the king’s treasuries.”","Tơdah ih lăp đon chih hla bơar tơjur nơ̆r tơtă athei pơlôch đi lu sư, inh gô ăn jên apah lăm ti lu kuan pơgơ̆r oei lăm anih pơtao. Wă kơ lu sư tah jên noh lăm hnam tah tơmam pơtao."
"So the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews.","Klaih kơ noh pơtao plôh tơkhiĕn đơ̆ng ti sư ăn kơ Haman wă pơsĭt bơngai Agak kon drŏ-nglo Hamedatha, bơngai mă ayăt kơ adrĕch Juđa."
"And the king said to Haman, “The money and the people are given to you, to do with them as seems good to you.”","Pơtao khan kơ Haman jao boih kơ ih pơm bĕ mơ̆ng kơ ih wă."
"Then the king’s scribes were called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and a decree was written according to all that Haman commanded—to the king’s satraps, to the governors who were over each province, to the officials of all people, to every province according to its script, and to every people in their language. In the name of King Ahasuerus it was written, and sealed with the king’s signet ring.","Lăm năr mơjĭt-pêng khei mă mônh, krao lu bơngai jang chih hla bơar tơbăt kơ tơdrong juăt kiơ̆ kơ Haman tơtă boih kơ lu kuan tih pơtao đĭ-đăng lu kră pơgơ̆r tơring păng đĭ kơ lu kră pơgơ̆r rim kon pơlei lăm jơ̆p kơ dêh, tơring ayơ chih kiơ̆ kơ nơ̆r sư kơdih, adrĕch ayơ chih kiơ̆ nơ̆r pơma sư kơdih.

"And the letters were sent by couriers into all the king’s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate all the Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, and to plunder their possessions.","Đe gơih hơtă kơ linh năm ba kơ đĭ-đăng tơring lăm char pơtao Asêrus, wă pơrăm pơlôch đĭ lu adrĕch adrung Juđa mă 'lơ̆p mă 'lŏ mă kră, mă drŏ-kăn, lăm năr mơjĭt-pêng khei mơjĭt-'bar khei Adar păng wă tơgar iŏk mŭk tơmam đơ̆ng lu sư."
"A copy of the document was to be issued as law in every province, being published for all people, that they should be ready for that day.","Chih minh hlak hla bơar dơ̆ng ăn kơ jơ̆p-jang tơring, ăn kơ đĭ adrĕch adrung băt, wă kơ lu sư hơmet adrol kơ năr noh."
"The couriers went out, hastened by the king’s command; and the decree was proclaimed in Shushan the citadel. So the king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Shushan was perplexed.","Lu bơngai chĕp hla bơar noh hăt hot pơm kiơ̆ kơ tơdrong pơtao tơtă. Nơ̆r tơtă âu kư̆m roi tơbăt lăm kon pơlei Susa.

"When Mordecai learned all that had happened, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the midst of the city. He cried out with a loud and bitter cry.","Kơplah Morđêkai băt đĭ-đăng kơ tơdrong wă truh noh na sư hek ao sư, iŏk su ao 'bi păng pung tơnuh tơ akâu sư, năm tơ tŏk-bŏk pơlei ôr krao păng nhơ̆m hmoi ơh sơ'ngon."
"He went as far as the front of the king’s gate, for no one might enter the king’s gate clothed with sackcloth.","Sư năm truh tơ 'nguaih 'măng dur pơtao đĕch yua kơ lu bơngai bu mă su 'bi ưh kơ gơh kơ mơ̆t ôh lăm 'măng dur pơtao noh."
"And in every province where the king’s command and decree arrived, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.","Lăm rim tơring mă đei hla bơar pơtao tơtă truh, đei ơh sơ'ngon nhơ̆m hmoi tih lăm adrĕch Juđa, nhơ̆m hmoi ơ̆t kơ sŏng sa ơh sơ'ngon, lơ bơngai su 'bi 'bĭch păng pung tơnuh."
"So Esther’s maids and eunuchs came and told her, and the queen was deeply distressed. Then she sent garments to clothe Mordecai and take his sackcloth away from him, but he would not accept them.","Kơplah lu kuan krĕo păng lu drŏ-kăn awih awăn kơ Esther năm roi tơbăt ăn kơ Esther tơdrong 'nâu, yă pơtao sơ'ngon rŭng răng dêh.

"Then Esther called Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs whom he had appointed to attend her, and she gave him a command concerning Mordecai, to learn what and why this was.","Esther krao Hathach minh 'nu lăm lu kuan krĕo bơngai jang tơgŭm yă pơtao athei năm truh tơ Morđêkai apinh wă kơ băt đei tơdrong kiơ, yua kơ kiơ đei tơdrong thoi noh."
"So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the city square that was in front of the king’s gate.","Hathach năm truh tơ Morđêkai tơ anih pơlei anăp 'măng dur pơtao."
"And Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, and the sum of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king’s treasuries to destroy the Jews.","Morđêkai roi đĭ dôm tơdrong truh kơ sư păng kư̆m roi tơbăt nơ̆r Haman pơkă wă tah kơsô̆ jên hu lăm hnam tah tơmam pơtao, yua wă pơlôch lu adrĕch Juđa."
"He also gave him a copy of the written decree for their destruction, which was given at Shushan, that he might show it to Esther and explain it to her, and that he might command her to go in to the king to make supplication to him and plead before him for her people.","Morđêkai kư̆m ăn minh hlak hla bơar chih rok nơ̆r tơtă roi tơlĕch boih tơ lăm pơlei tih Susa tơdrong wă pơlôch adrĕch Juđa, wă kơ sư roi tơbăt ăn kơ Esther dôm nơ̆r đơ̆ng Morđêkai tơlang ăn kơ Esther păng roi ăn wă ăn Esther athei năm apinh pơtao mơnat pơklaih adrĕch Juđa sư kơdih."
"So Hathach returned and told Esther the words of Mordecai.","Hathach brŏk roi kơ Esther dôm nơ̆r đơ̆ng Morđêkai khan."
"Then Esther spoke to Hathach, and gave him a command for Mordecai","Esther roi kơ Hathach athei năm roi ăn kơ Morđêkai thoi âu"
"“All the king’s servants and the people of the king’s provinces know that any man or woman who goes into the inner court to the king, who has not been called, he has but one law: put all to death, except the one to whom the king holds out the golden scepter, that he may live. Yet I myself have not been called to go in to the king these thirty days.”","Đĭ-đăng mă lu kuan linh krĕo jang kơ pơtao, dah kon pơlei pơla lăm char pơtao đĭ-đăng băt ngăl mă drŏ-nglo dah drŏ-kăn ưh kơ gơh kơ mơ̆t tơ lăm anih pơtao tơdah pơtao ưh kơ krao, tơdah bu mơ̆t ưh kơ kiơ̆ tơdrong juăt đe gô pơlôch; mă-lei tơdah pơtao yơ̆r 'long jra maih lei bơngai noh arih.

"So they told Mordecai Esther’s words.","Hathach roi kơ Morđêkai nơ̆r Esther."
"And Mordecai told them to answer Esther: “Do not think in your heart that you will escape in the king’s palace any more than all the other Jews.","Na Morđêkai athei năm roi dơ̆ng kơ Esther thoi âu: Ih 'nĕ tơchĕng khan yua kơ ih oei lăm hnam pơtao na gơh klaih hloh kơ adrĕch bơngai Juđa."
"For if you remain completely silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place, but you and your father’s house will perish. Yet who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this?”","Yua kơ tơdah ih ngăn lăm jơ 'nâu gô đei trong nai dơ̆ng pơklaih adrĕch Juđa, mă-lei ih păng hnam dơnŏ 'bă ih kư̆m gô lôch răm.

"Then Esther told them to reply to Mordecai","Kơtơ̆ng thoi noh boih, Esther athei sư năm roi dơ̆ng kơ Morđêkai thoi âu"
"“Go, gather all the Jews who are present in Shushan, and fast for me; neither eat nor drink for three days, night or day. My maids and I will fast likewise. And so I will go to the king, which is against the law; and if I perish, I perish!”","Akŭm đĭ-đăng lu adrĕch bơngai Juđa tơ pơlei Susa bĕ, đơ̆ng noh athei ơ̆t kơ sŏng sa lăm pêng năr yua kơ inh, 'nĕ sŏng sa, kư̆m 'nĕ kơ nhă đak.

"So Mordecai went his way and did according to all that Esther commanded him.","Thoi noh Morđêkai năm pơm kiơ̆ dôm tơdrong Esther đei pơkă kơ sư."
"Now it happened on the third day that Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the king’s palace, across from the king’s house, while the king sat on his royal throne in the royal house, facing the entrance of the house.","Lăm năr mă pêng Esther hrŭk ao yă pơtao sư klaih kơ noh sư năm dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp 'măng tơklă anih tang-dŏ pơtao hơ-oei, pơtao sư hơ-oei tang-dŏ tơklă 'măng mơ̆t anih pơtao sư."
"So it was, when the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, that she found favor in his sight, and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. Then Esther went near and touched the top of the scepter.","Lăp pơtao 'bôh yă pơtao Esther dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp 'măng, sư lăng 'brơ̆k mơnat, sư yơ̆r 'long jra maih sư tơ yă Esther, yă Esther năm jê̆ păng pel kơnhŏng 'long jra noh."
"And the king said to her, “What do you wish, Queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be given to you—up to half the kingdom!”","Pơtao pơma apinh. Ơ yă pơtao Esther ih wă apinh inh tơdrong kiơ? Ih wă kơ inh ăn kơ ih kiơ? Mă ih apinh minh puăt teh đak inh kư̆m ăn kơ ih."
"So Esther answered, “If it pleases the king, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.”","Yă Esther tơl: Tơdah ih lăp đon, apinh ih păng Haman năr âu năm sŏng sa inh đei hơmet ăn kơ ih boih."
"Then the king said, “Bring Haman quickly, that he may do as Esther has said.” So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared.","Pơtao khan kơ bơngai awih awăn kơ sư Chông ba Haman mă tĕnh wă kơ bơ̆n pơm kiơ̆ thoi Esther wă na pơtao păng Haman năm sŏng sa mă Esther đei hơmet boih."
"At the banquet of wine the king said to Esther, “What is your petition? It shall be granted you. What is your request, up to half the kingdom? It shall be done!”","Kơplah sư oei et sik hơmu, pơtao apinh Esther Ih wă apinh kiơ? Inh gô ăn kơ ih. Tơdrong kiơ ih wă? Mă khan minh puăt dêh char inh pơgơ̆r inh kư̆m ăn mơ̆n."
"Then Esther answered and said, “My petition and request is this","Esther tơl: 'Nâu tơdrong inh wă păng tơdrong inh hơpơi."
"If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and fulfill my request, then let the king and Haman come to the banquet which I will prepare for them, and tomorrow I will do as the king has said.”","Tơdah pơtao mơnat kơ inh păng tơdah pơtao đei jơhngơ̆m 'lơ̆ng na mơ̆ng nơ̆r inh apinh asong kiơ̆ kơ nơ̆r inh hơpơi, lei dơning apinh ih păng Haman năm sŏng sa mă inh gô hơmet dơ̆ng, năr dơning inh gô roi tơdrong kiơ inh wă apinh ih."
"So Haman went out that day joyful and with a glad heart; but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, and that he did not stand or tremble before him, he was filled with indignation against Mordecai.","Lăm năr noh Haman lĕch năm hăm jơhngơ̆m hiôk chơt.

"Nevertheless Haman restrained himself and went home, and he sent and called for his friends and his wife Zeresh.","Mă-lei Haman ĕnh, na wih brŏk tơ hnam sư. Sư wơh đe năm krao bôl buăl sư păng akăn sư Sêrêt."
"Then Haman told them of his great riches, the multitude of his children, everything in which the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the officials and servants of the king.","Haman roi pơư kơdih akâu, tơdrong mơdrŏng sư, roi sư đei kon drŏ-nglo lơ, roi kơ pơtao pơyom kơ sư păng sư pơm yŏng hloh kơ lu kuan tih nai."
"Moreover Haman said, “Besides, Queen Esther invited no one but me to come in with the king to the banquet that she prepared; and tomorrow I am again invited by her, along with the king.","Haman khan dơ̆ng.

"Yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.”","Mă-lei tơdrong noh ưh kơ đei yua kiơ kơ inh mưh inh lăng Morđêkai bơngai Juđa hơ-oei 'bơ̆t 'măng jang hnam pơtao."
"Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, “Let a gallows be made, fifty cubits high, and in the morning suggest to the king that Mordecai be hanged on it; then go merrily with the king to the banquet.” And the thing pleased Haman; so he had the gallows made.","Akăn sư Sêrêt păng đĭ-đăng lu buăl sư wang khan kơ sư: Athei bĕ đe pơdơ̆ng gơ̆ng atol bơngai kơjung pơđăm-jĭt hơgăt, na pơgê dơning athei pơtao ăn đe rôp hrek atol Morđêkai tơ noh.

"That night the king could not sleep. So one was commanded to bring the book of the records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king.","Lăm măng noh pơtao ưh kơsŭk tep, na athei đe iŏk sơ̆p hla bơar đe chih răk hơ'mon tơdrong lu pơtao pơgơ̆r na đŏk 'bơ̆t anăp sư."
"And it was found written that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs, the doorkeepers who had sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus.","Đe đŏk 'bôh đei chih boih Morđêkai đei roi boih kơ tơdrong Bikthana păng Têres, 'bar 'nu kuan gak 'măng jang pơtao chă đon wă pơrăm pơtao Asêrus."
"Then the king said, “What honor or dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this?” And the king’s servants who attended him said, “Nothing has been done for him.”","Pơtao jet, lăm tơdrong 'nâu Morđêkai đe hăm ư-ang păng pôk pơyom kơ sư ưh?

"So the king said, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the king’s palace to suggest that the king hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.","Pơtao jet dơ̆ng.

"The king’s servants said to him, “Haman is there, standing in the court.” And the king said, “Let him come in.”","Lu bơngai jang kơ pơtao tơl. To noh Haman oei dơ̆ng tơ cham, pơtao khan. Ăn kơ sư mơ̆t bĕ."
"So Haman came in, and the king asked him, “What shall be done for the man whom the king delights to honor?” Now Haman thought in his heart, “Whom would the king delight to honor more than me?”","Đơ̆ng noh Haman mơ̆t, na pơtao khan kơ sư.

"And Haman answered the king, “For the man whom the king delights to honor","Haman khan kơ pơtao, bơngai mă pơtao wă pơyom"
"let a royal robe be brought which the king has worn, and a horse on which the king has ridden, which has a royal crest placed on its head.","athei đe chĕp ba kơ sư ao mă pơtao hrŭk, dui ba aseh mă pơtao juăt kơ hao păng pơyơ̆l ăn môk pơtao."
"Then let this robe and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king’s most noble princes, that he may array the man whom the king delights to honor. Then parade him on horseback through the city square, and proclaim before him: ‘Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!’ ”","Athei 'bok kuan mă tih hloh, iŏk ao păng aseh pơtao, đơ̆ng noh pơhrŭk ăn ao pơtao kơ bơngai mă pơtao wă pơyom.

"Then the king said to Haman, “Hurry, take the robe and the horse, as you have suggested, and do so for Mordecai the Jew who sits within the king’s gate! Leave nothing undone of all that you have spoken.”","Pơtao khan kơ Haman, năm tĕnh tĕnh bĕ!

"So Haman took the robe and the horse, arrayed Mordecai and led him on horseback through the city square, and proclaimed before him, “Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!”","Na Haman năm iŏk hloi ao pơhrŭk ăn kơ Morđêkai, đơ̆ng noh hao aseh ba sư năm jơ̆p rok trong tih lăm pơlei.

"Afterward Mordecai went back to the king’s gate. But Haman hurried to his house, mourning and with his head covered.","Đơ̆ng noh Morđêkai wih hơlơ̆k tơ 'măng jang hnam pơtao. Mă-lei Haman hăt hot brŏk tơ hnam sư kơdih, kơlŭk gom kơ̆l sư ơh sơ'ngon."
"When Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had happened to him, his wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him, “If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of Jewish descent, you will not prevail against him but will surely fall before him.”","Haman roi ăn kơ akăn sư Sêrêt păng lu bôl buăl sư băt dôm tơdrong mă đei truh kơ sư.

"While they were still talking with him, the king’s eunuchs came, and hastened to bring Haman to the banquet which Esther had prepared.","Kơplah lu đe noh oei pơma dơnuh hăm sư đei lu linh bơ̆jang kơ pơtao truh, hăt hot chông Haman năm sŏng sa mă yă pơtao Esther đei hơmet lê̆ boih."
"So the king and Haman went to dine with Queen Esther.","Thoi noh pơtao păng Haman truh sŏng sa hơdai hăm yă pơtao Esther."
"And on the second day, at the banquet of wine, the king again said to Esther, “What is your petition, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what is your request, up to half the kingdom? It shall be done!”","Lăm năr mă 'bar kơplah lu sư oei et sik hơmu pơtao khan dơ̆ng kơ Esther. Ih wă apinh tơdrong kiơ, ơ yă pơtao Esther?

"Then Queen Esther answered and said, “If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request.","Yă pơtao Esther tơl sư; tơdah inh đei tơdrong mơnat 'bơ̆t anăp ih păng tơdah ih lăp đon apinh ih ăn kơ inh arih păng ăn kơ adrĕch adrung inh arih, noh tơdrong inh wă apinh?"
"For we have been sold, my people and I, to be destroyed, to be killed, and to be annihilated. Had we been sold as male and female slaves, I would have held my tongue, although the enemy could never compensate for the king’s loss.”","Yua kơ inh păng adrĕch adrung inh đe đĭ tĕch boih wă pơlôch pơrăm păng wă tơhiong lê̆.

"So King Ahasuerus answered and said to Queen Esther, “Who is he, and where is he, who would dare presume in his heart to do such a thing?”","Pơtao Asêrus khan kơ yă pơtao Esther. Bơngai ei bu, sư oei tơ yơ, mă pơ̆n pơm tơdrong ei."
"And Esther said, “The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman!” So Haman was terrified before the king and queen.","Esther tơl: Minh 'nu bơngai ayăt kơnê̆ noh jơ̆ Haman! Kơplah noh Haman hli dêh 'bơ̆t anăp pơtao păng yă pơtao Esther."
"Then the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden; but Haman stood before Queen Esther, pleading for his life, for he saw that evil was determined against him by the king.","Pơtao blĕk iung weh hloi đơ̆ng gơ'bang sŏng sa; đơ̆ng noh năm mơ̆t lăm anih pơgar pơkao 'bơ̆t cham pơtao.

"When the king returned from the palace garden to the place of the banquet of wine, Haman had fallen across the couch where Esther was. Then the king said, “Will he also assault the queen while I am in the house?” As the word left the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face.","Kơplah pơtao hơlơ̆k wih đơ̆ng pơgar pơtao, wơ̆t tơ anih lu sư oei et sa na 'bôh Haman oei drap 'bơ̆t tang-dŏ kơjung yă Esther oei ngôi.

"Now Harbonah, one of the eunuchs, said to the king, “Look! The gallows, fifty cubits high, which Haman made for Mordecai, who spoke good on the king’s behalf, is standing at the house of Haman.” Then the king said, “Hang him on it!”","Kơplah noh Harbôna minh 'nu lăm lu linh krĕo wei pơtao khan: To đei boih 'long gơ̆ng mă Haman đei pơdơ̆ng lê̆ boih wă atol Morđêkai, Morđêkai bơngai mă dŏng pơrih pơtao, 'long gơ̆ng noh kơjung pơđăm-jĭt hơgăt, pơtao khan, hrek atol bĕ sư tơ kơpal noh."
"So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king’s wrath subsided.","Thoi noh na đe hrek atol Haman tơ 'long gơ̆ng mă sư đei pơdơ̆ng wă hrek atol Morđêkai. Đơ̆ng noh tơdrong pơtao blĕk ưh pă đei boih."
"On that day King Ahasuerus gave Queen Esther the house of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. And Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had told how he was related to her.","Lăm năr noh pơtao Asêrus jao ăn kơ yă pơtao Esther bri seh teh choh mŭk tơmam hnam oei Haman bơngai mă ayăt kơ adrĕch bơngai Juđa păng Morđêkai năm 'bơ̆t anăp pơtao, yua kơ Esther roi kơ sư noh 'nhŏng oh sư kơdih."
"So the king took off his signet ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai; and Esther appointed Mordecai over the house of Haman.","Pơtao plôh iŏk tơkhiĕn mă đêl sư pơsĭt đơ̆ng Haman jao kơ Morđêkai yă pơtao Esther jao ăn kơ Morđêkai wei-lăng hnam đêl Haman oei."
"Now Esther spoke again to the king, fell down at his feet, and implored him with tears to counteract the evil of Haman the Agagite, and the scheme which he had devised against the Jews.","Esther pơma dơ̆ng hăm pơtao sư drap 'bơ̆t jơ̆ng pơtao, nhơ̆m apinh hơdrĭ 'bơ̆t pơtao apinh pơtao pơrăm lê̆ tơdrong Haman bơngai Agak chă đon wă pơrăm adrĕch Juđa."
"And the king held out the golden scepter toward Esther. So Esther arose and stood before the king","Pơtao yơ̆r 'long jra maih kơ yă Esther. Đơ̆ng noh yă Esther iung dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp pơtao."
"and said, “If it pleases the king, and if I have found favor in his sight and the thing seems right to the king and I am pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to revoke the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to annihilate the Jews who are in all the king’s provinces.","Na sư khan thoi âu: Tơdah ih lăp đon tơdah ih mơnat kơ inh, tơdah ih lăng tơdrong âu lăp 'lơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp ih, na apinh chih hla bơar tơjur nơ̆r hŭt lê̆ tơdrong Haman bơngai Agak kon drŏ-nglo Hamadatha chih hla bơar wă pơrăm adrĕch Juđa mă oei jơ̆p kơ lăm dêh char pơtao."
"For how can I endure to see the evil that will come to my people? Or how can I endure to see the destruction of my countrymen?”","Liơ inh gơh kĕ chu iŏk tơdrong răm truh kơ adrĕch adrung inh? Păng liơ inh gơh kĕ dơ̆ng lăng kon pơlei inh răm rai."
"Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew, “Indeed, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows because he tried to lay his hand on the Jews.","Pơtao Asêrus khan kơ yă pơtao Esther păng Morđêkai bơngai Juđa thoi âu: 'Nâu inh jao boih hnam Haman kơ yă pơtao Esther, đe hrek atol boih Haman tơ kơpal gơ̆ng, yua kơ sư wă pơrăm bơngai Juđa."
"You yourselves write a decree concerning the Jews, as you please, in the king’s name, and seal it with the king’s signet ring; for whatever is written in the king’s name and sealed with the king’s signet ring no one can revoke.”","Thoi noh măr iĕm chih roi bĕ kiơ̆ kơ măr iĕm tơchĕng lăp gah adrĕch Juđa hăm anăn pơtao păng iŏk tơkhiĕn pơtao pơsĭt; yua kơ lăm tơdrong juăt đei chih hăm anăn pơtao păng chơ̆m pơsĭt boih hăm tơkhiĕn pơtao đe ưh pă gơh tơplih dơ̆ng."
"So the king’s scribes were called at that time, in the third month, which is the month of Sivan, on the twenty-third day; and it was written, according to all that Mordecai commanded, to the Jews, the satraps, the governors, and the princes of the provinces from India to Ethiopia, one hundred and twenty-seven provinces in all, to every province in its own script, to every people in their own language, and to the Jews in their own script and language.","Lăm năr noh hloi, năr 'bar-jĭt pêng khei pêng wă khan khei Siwan, kơplah noh bre Esther păng Morđêkai krao akŭm thây chih hla bơar lu sư chih kiơ̆ kơ nơ̆r Morđêkai pơtă chih ăn kơ adrĕch Juđa, gơih ăn kơ lu kuan tih lu kră pơgơ̆r char, kră pơgơ̆r tơring iŏk đơ̆ng Ânđô̆ truh tơ Êthiôpi, wă khan minh-hrĕng 'bar-jĭt tơpơh tŏ tơring char.

"And he wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, sealed it with the king’s signet ring, and sent letters by couriers on horseback, riding on royal horses bred from swift steeds.","Morđêkai chih hăm anăn pơtao Asêrus păng iŏk tơkhiĕn pơtao chơ̆m pơsĭt hăm chih anăn sư, đơ̆ng noh wơh linh năm ba hla bơar noh hao aseh dăm, pran kuăng."
"By these letters the king permitted the Jews who were in every city to gather together and protect their lives—to destroy, kill, and annihilate all the forces of any people or province that would assault them, both little children and women, and to plunder their possessions","Lăm hla bơar chih noh pơtao ăn lu bơngai Juđa lăm rim pơlei gơh akŭm băl hơdai wă dŏng tơdrong arih lu sư kơdih wă pơrăm pơlôch wă pơtôch tơhiong lu linh lu pơlei dah mă lu char wă pơrăm lu sư, hăm lu kon akăn lu sư, kư̆m ăn kơ lu sư gơh blah tơgar iŏk mŭk tơmam lu đe ayăt kơ lu sư."
"on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar.","Tơdrong noh gơh pơm lăp minh năr lăm năr mơjĭt-pêng khei mơjĭt-'bar, wă khan khei Adar lăm jơ̆p-jang kơ char pơtao Asêrus pơgơ̆r."
"A copy of the document was to be issued as a decree in every province and published for all people, so that the Jews would be ready on that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.","Minh hlak hla bơar plơ̆ng chih rok nơ̆r pơtao gơih ăn kơ rim tơring char rim adrĕch băt wă kơ lu bơngai Juđa gô hơmet lăm năr noh wă pơm 'mong tơiung kơting đơ̆ng lu ayăt pơm."
"The couriers who rode on royal horses went out, hastened and pressed on by the king’s command. And the decree was issued in Shushan the citadel.","Thoi noh lu bơngai năm ba hla bơar noh hao aseh dăm pran kuăng, hăt hot chu kiơ̆ nơ̆r pơtao pơkă athei.

"So Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, with a great crown of gold and a garment of fine linen and purple; and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad.","Morđêkai lĕch đơ̆ng anăp pơtao hrŭk hơbĕn ao jơk kok, yơ̆l môk maih pơtao păng hrŭk ao tai che 'bui se 'brê hơhĭm, kơplah noh kon pơlei Susa ôr jreo chhôk hơnôk."
"The Jews had light and gladness, joy and honor.","Adrĕch Juđa chơt hiôk chhôk 'nă hal hơdah hơdong. Kŭm đei tơdrong đe pơyom kơ lu sư."
"And in every province and city, wherever the king’s command and decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a holiday. Then many of the people of the land became Jews, because fear of the Jews fell upon them.","Lăm rim tơring, rim pơlei, anih ayơ mă đei iŏk hla bơar pơkă đơ̆ng pơtao truh tơ tơring noh đei tơdrong chơt hiôk chhôk hơiă kơ adrĕch adrung Juđa, minh năr et sa chơt hiôk.

"Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month of Adar, on the thirteenth day, the time came for the king’s command and his decree to be executed. On the day that the enemies of the Jews had hoped to overpower them, the opposite occurred, in that the Jews themselves overpowered those who hated them.","Lăm khei mơjĭt-'bar, đe anăn khei Adar, năr mơjĭt-pêng lăm khei âu, kơplah wă jê̆ jơ 'năr nơ̆r pơtao pơkă wă pơsĭt boih, 'bơ̆t năr lu bơngai ayăt kơ adrĕch Juđa khan wă jei lu sư ră, mă-lei tơplih tơdrong lu sư wă noh jing jei lu bơngai Juđa pơgơ̆r plơ̆ lu sư dơ̆ng"
"The Jews gathered together in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to lay hands on those who sought their harm. And no one could withstand them, because fear of them fell upon all people.","lu bơngai Juđa akŭm băl tơ rim pơlei lu sư lăm jơ̆p-jang rim tơring dêh char pơtao Asêrus pơgơ̆r wă pơlôch lu bơngai mă wă pơrăm lu sư; ưh kơ đei bơngai bu kĕ găn lu sư, yua kơ đĭ-đăng lu bơngai adrĕch adrung nai hli dêh kơ adrĕch Juđa."
"And all the officials of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, and all those doing the king’s work, helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them.","Đĭ-đăng lu kră pơgơ̆r, lu kuan tih, lu kră wei-lăng tơring păng lu kuan tih jang kơ pơtao, kư̆m wang tơgŭm lu bơngai Juđa, yua kơ lu sư hli kơ Morđêkai."
"For Mordecai was great in the king’s palace, and his fame spread throughout all the provinces; for this man Mordecai became increasingly prominent.","Yua kơ Morđêkai pơm tih lăm hnam pơtao, đe ư-ang anăn sư jơ̆p-jang kơ dêh char; yua kơ Morđêkai pơgơ̆r rai đunh rai pran."
"Thus the Jews defeated all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, with slaughter and destruction, and did what they pleased with those who hated them.","Thoi noh lu bơngai Juđa yua đao gưm koh pơlôch đĭ-đăng lu bơngai ayăt kơ lu sư, bơngai bu hil areh kơ lu sư, lu sư pơm kơ đe noh mơ̆ng kiơ̆ kơ lu sư wă."
"And in Shushan the citadel the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men.","Lăm pơlei tih Susa lu bơngai Juđa pơlôch pơđăm-hrĕng 'nu lu bơngai drŏ-nglo."
"Also Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha","Lu sư kư̆m pơlôch Parsandatha, Dalphôn, Apatha"
"Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha","Pơratha, Adalia, Aridatha."
"Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vajezatha","Parmasta, Arisai, Aridai păng Waisatha."
"the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews—they killed; but they did not lay a hand on the plunder.","Wă khan mơjĭt 'nu kon drŏ-nglo Haman, sâu drŏ-nglo Hamadatha bơngai mă ayăt pơm kơnê̆ kơ adrĕch Juđa. Mă-lei lu sư ưh kơ blah iŏk mŭk tơmam ôh."
"On that day the number of those who were killed in Shushan the citadel was brought to the king.","Lăm năr noh đe roi kơ pơtao băt hơdôm 'nu bơngai lôch lăm pơlei Susa."
"And the king said to Queen Esther, “The Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the citadel, and the ten sons of Haman. What have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? Now what is your petition? It shall be granted to you. Or what is your further request? It shall be done.”","Pơtao roi kơ yă pơtao Esther khan: Lu bơngai Juđa đei pơlôch boih pơđăm-hrĕng 'nu bơngai lăm pơlei tih Susa păng kư̆m pơlôch mơjĭt 'nu kon drŏ-nglo Haman hai.

"Then Esther said, “If it pleases the king, let it be granted to the Jews who are in Shushan to do again tomorrow according to today’s decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged on the gallows.”","Yă pơtao Esther tơl: Tơdah ih lăp đon năr dơning kư̆m thoi năr 'nâu, ăn kơ lu bơngai Juđa iŏk hrek atol mơjĭt 'nu kon drŏ-nglo Haman noh tơ 'long gơ̆ng kơjung to."
"So the king commanded this to be done; the decree was issued in Shushan, and they hanged Haman’s ten sons.","Pơtao ăn kơ đe pơm kiơ̆ thoi noh, chih hla bơar roi tơbăt lăm pơlei Susa, na đe atol akâu mơjĭt 'nu kon drŏ-nglo Haman."
"And the Jews who were in Shushan gathered together again on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and killed three hundred men at Shushan; but they did not lay a hand on the plunder.","Lu bơngai Juđa mă oei lăm pơlei Susa akŭm băl dơ̆ng lăm năr mơjĭt-puăn khei Adar, na pơlôch pêng-hrĕng 'nu bơngai drŏ-nglo lăm pơlei Susa; mă-lei lu sư ưh kơ blah iŏk tơmam dah mŭk măk ôh."
"The remainder of the Jews in the king’s provinces gathered together and protected their lives, had rest from their enemies, and killed seventy-five thousand of their enemies; but they did not lay a hand on the plunder.","Lu bơngai Juđa nai mă oei lăm dêh char pơtao pơgơ̆r, kư̆m akŭm băl mơ̆n wă pơklaih tơdrong arih kơdih akâu, blah lu bơngai ayăt kơ lu sư, pơlôch tơpơh-jĭt pơđăm-rơbâu 'nu bơngai areh kơ lu sư, mă-lei lu sư ưh kơ blah iŏk mŭk tơmam ôh."
"This was on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. And on the fourteenth of the month they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness.","Lu sư pơm tơdrong noh lăm năr mơjĭt-pêng khei Adar, năr mơjĭt-puăn lăm khei noh mơ̆n lu sư pơdơh, pơih minh năr pơm năr sŏng sa chơt hiôk."
"But the Jews who were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day, as well as on the fourteenth; and on the fifteenth of the month they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.","Mă-lei lu bơngai oei lăm pơlei Susa akŭm tơblah ayăt sư năr mơjĭt-pêng păng năr mơjĭt-puăn na năr mơjĭt-pơđăm pơdơh, pơm năr sŏng sa chơt hiôk."
"Therefore the Jews of the villages who dwelt in the unwalled towns celebrated the fourteenth day of the month of Adar with gladness and feasting, as a holiday, and for sending presents to one another.","Yua kơ noh lu bơngai Juđa oei lăm pơlei iĕ, iŏk năr mơjĭt-puăn khei Adar pơih minh năr pơm sŏng sa tih chơt hiôk 'blŏk hơdơ̆r pơm năr giĕng pơdơh, lăm năr noh lu sư gơih băl tơmam lăng jơ̆ng ti tơduă lu sư."
"And Mordecai wrote these things and sent letters to all the Jews, near and far, who were in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus","Morđêkai chih răk dôm tơdrong noh, đơ̆ng noh gơih kơthơ ăn rim 'nu bơngai Juđa oei tơ lăm jơ̆p-jang char pơtao Asêrus pơgơ̆r, mă jê̆ mă ataih."
"to establish among them that they should celebrate yearly the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar","Sư tơtă wă kơ lu sư răk 'blŏk lăm rim sơnăm 'bơ̆t năr mơjĭt-puăn păng mơjĭt-pơđăm khei Adar"
"as the days on which the Jews had rest from their enemies, as the month which was turned from sorrow to joy for them, and from mourning to a holiday; that they should make them days of feasting and joy, of sending presents to one another and gifts to the poor.","yua kơ lăm năr păng khei ei lu bơngai Juđa klaih rơngei đơ̆ng lu bơngai ayăt kơ lu sư păng lu sư gơh đei rơnŭk rơnua.

"So the Jews accepted the custom which they had begun, as Mordecai had written to them","Thoi noh na rim sơnăm lu bơngai Juđa kư̆ kơ pơm thoi lu sư đei pơm boih lăm sơnăm tơm hmơm noh, lu sư pơm kiơ̆ tơdrong Morđêkai đei chih kơ lu sư."
"because Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to annihilate them, and had cast Pur (that is, the lot), to consume them and destroy them","Yua kơ Haman kon drŏ-nglo Hamadatha bơngai Agak, bơngai mă ayăt đĭ-đăng kơ adrĕch Juđa, sư chă đon wă pơrăm păng pơlôch pơgoh adrĕch Juđa. Lu sư đei rơih iŏk boih pur wă khan năr hơgăt lê̆ năr wă pơlôch pơrăm pơgoh adrĕch Juđa."
"but when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letter that this wicked plot which Haman had devised against the Jews should return on his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.","Mă-lei kơplah yă Esther năm 'bơ̆t anăp pơtao wă roi tơdrong noh, na pơtao tơjur nơ̆r chih thoi âu: Tơdrong kơnê̆ Haman chă đon wă pơrăm adrĕch Juđa noh thoi tuh plơ̆ tơ kơ̆l sư kơdih, đơ̆ng noh đe hrek atol sư păng lu kon drŏ-nglo sư tơ kơpal 'long gơ̆ng."
"So they called these days Purim, after the name Pur. Therefore, because of all the words of this letter, what they had seen concerning this matter, and what had happened to them","Yua kơ noh đe krao năr noh Purim kiơ̆ kơ chư pur.

"the Jews established and imposed it upon themselves and their descendants and all who would join them, that without fail they should celebrate these two days every year, according to the written instructions and according to the prescribed time","thoi noh na bơngai Juđa iŏk răk năr kơ lu sư kơdih păng răk kơ lu kon sâu sư păng ăn kơ lu bơngai mơ̆t khŭl sư, wă kơ rim sơnăm wei răk 'bar năr âu kiơ̆ kơ hla bơar đei chih boih, ưh kơ gơh bu hiơt."
"that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city, that these days of Purim should not fail to be observed among the Jews, and that the memory of them should not perish among their descendants.","Wă kơ đe 'blŏk hơdơ̆r kơ năr noh lăm đĭ jơhnơr, đĭ-đăng adrĕch adrung păng jơ̆p kơ dêh char, rim pơlei, wă kơ năr Purim âu ưh kơ đei bu hiơt lăm adrĕch Juđa păng kư̆m ưh kơ tơhiong lê̆ ôh lăm kon sâu se lu sư."
"Then Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, with Mordecai the Jew, wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter about Purim.","Yă pơtao Esther kon Abihai păng Morđêkai bơngai Juđa chih gơih dơ̆ng kơthơ mă 'bar athei wei răk rim kơ năr Purim."
"And Mordecai sent letters to all the Jews, to the one hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth","Morđêkai gơih ăn hla bơar lu kơthơ âu kơ đĭ-đăng adrĕch Juđa, oei lăm minh-hrĕng 'bar-jĭt tơpơh tŏ char lăm dêh char pơtao Asêrus pơgơ̆r; bre sư chih hăm nơ̆r rơngơp hăm tơdrong tơpă"
"to confirm these days of Purim at their appointed time, as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had prescribed for them, and as they had decreed for themselves and their descendants concerning matters of their fasting and lamenting.","Wă kơ lu sư iŏk năr Purim noh pơm năr 'blŏk hơdơ̆r kiơ̆ thoi Morđêkai bơngai Juđa păng yă pơtao Esther bơtho pơkă boih kơ lu bơngai Juđa, thoi lu sư păng kon sâu sư kư̆m đei pơm kơdih, gah tơdrong ơ̆t kơ sŏng sa păng nhơ̆m hmoi."
"So the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim, and it was written in the book.","Tơdrong yă Esther pơkă kơ jơ̆p dêh char kơ năr Purim pơsĭt lê̆ nơ̆r tơtă adrol păng tơdrong noh kư̆m đei chih răk lăm sơ̆p hla bơar."
"And King Ahasuerus imposed tribute on the land and on the islands of the sea.","Pơtao Asêrus athei lăm char sư mă tơ teh dah tơ bŏl dơsĭ wang ăn thuê̆."
"Now all the acts of his power and his might, and the account of the greatness of Mordecai, to which the king advanced him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?","Đĭ-đăng tơdrong jang pơtao pơgơ̆r păng tơdrong gơh kĕ sư păng đĭ-đăng tơdrong kơ Morđêkai pơm tih yua kơ pơtao pôk hơtŏk sư boih, đe đei chih lăm sơ̆p hla bơar tơdrong hơ'mon tơdrong jang lu pơtao dêh char Mêdi păng char Phersia."
"For Mordecai the Jew was second to King Ahasuerus, and was great among the Jews and well received by the multitude of his brethren, seeking the good of his people and speaking peace to all his countrymen.","Yua kơ Morđêkai bơngai Juđa jing minh 'nu bơngai pơm kơiĕng pơtao Asêrus păng pơm tih lăm adrĕch Juđa, hăm đĭ-đăng lu 'nhŏng oh sư lăp đon kơ sư, yua kơ sư chă tơdrong pơm 'lơ̆ng kơ kon pơlei pơla pơma rơngơp kơ đĭ-đăng adrĕch adrung sư păng tơgŭm dŏng adrĕch adrung sư hiôk-hian. 25-Nov-2005@13:33, Backup Description=25-Nov-2005@13:30, Billy - 29-Nov-2005@10:12, Backup Description=25-Nov-2005@16:45, David Le vp - 29-Nov-2005@10:23, Backup Description=29-Nov-2005@10:21, Billy"
