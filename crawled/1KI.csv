"Now King David was old, advanced in years; and they put covers on him, but he could not get warm.","Pơtao Đawit đĭ kră sơnăm đĭ kơjung boih, mă khan đe pơhrŭk ăn hơbĕn ao kơ sư lơ hơdôm blah ră mă-lei sư oei ưh kơ tơnŏ."
"Therefore his servants said to him, “Let a young woman, a virgin, be sought for our lord the king, and let her stand before the king, and let her care for him; and let her lie in your bosom, that our lord the king may be warm.”","Na lu đĭch đam sư khan kơ sư: “Lê̆ nhôn chă ăn kơ ih mă yŏng pơtao nhôn, minh 'nu adruh 'nao iung, wă kơ sư awih awăn păng wei-lăng ih.

"So they sought for a lovely young woman throughout all the territory of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king.","Thoi noh lu sư chă minh 'nu adruh 'lơ̆ng guăng đơ̆ng lăm dêh char Isơrael, lu sư chă 'bôh minh 'nu adruh anăn sư Abisak, bơngai Sunami păng chông ba sư năm tơ pơtao."
"The young woman was very lovely; and she cared for the king, and served him; but the king did not know her.","Adruh noh 'lơ̆ng hơbŏ dêh, sư wei-lăng păng awih awăn kơ pơtao, mă-lei pơtao ưh kơ jê̆ sư ôh."
"Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, “I will be king”; and he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.","Adonija kon yă Hagit, pôk atŏk sư kơdih khan: “Inh gô pơm pơtao” Sư chă hơmet kơ sư gre aseh lơlap păng chă bơngai hao gre aseh đei pơđăm-jĭt 'nu kơdâu adrol kơ sư."
"(And his father had not rebuked him at any time by saying, “Why have you done so?” He was also very good-looking. His mother had borne him after Absalom.)","'Bă sư ưh kơ đei wă pơm kơ sư sơ'ngon ôh, hăm nơ̆r jet: “Liơ e pơm thoi noh?” Adonija jơ̆ minh 'nu bơngai 'lơ̆ng hơbŏ dêh, mĕ sư tơpŭ kơ sư đơ̆ng rŏng kơ Apsalôm."
"Then he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest, and they followed and helped Adonijah.","Sư pơđâu băl hăm Jôap kon drŏ-nglo Sêruia păng hăm 'bok soi Abiathar. Lu sư kiơ̆ Adonija păng tơgŭm sư."
"But Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David were not with Adonijah.","Mă-lei 'bok soi Sadôk, Bênaia kon drŏ-nglo Jêhôiada, Nathan bơngai khan lê̆ adrol, Simei, Rei păng lu linh Đawit mă nuih kơtang ưh kơ kiơ̆ ôh Adonija."
"And Adonijah sacrificed sheep and oxen and fattened cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by En Rogel; he also invited all his brothers, the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah, the king’s servants.","Adonija pơyơ̆r triu, rơmo păng kon rơmo bek, pơm tơmam soi 'bơ̆t tơmo Sohôlet, jê̆ Ên Rôgel.

"But he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the mighty men, or Solomon his brother.","Mă-lei sư ưh kơ krao wơ̆n ôh Nathan 'bok khan lê̆ adrol, dah Bênaia, dah lu linh nuih kơtang păng kư̆m ưh kơ krao wơ̆n mơ̆n Sôlômôn oh sư."
"So Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, “Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith has become king, and David our lord does not know it?","Na Nathan khan kơ Batsêba mĕ Sôlômôn. “Ih ưh kơ băt ôh hă Adonija kon drŏ-nglo yă Hagit pơm pơtao, mă Đawit pơtao bơ̆n kư̆m ưh kơ băt mơ̆n tơdrong noh hă?"
"Come, please, let me now give you advice, that you may save your own life and the life of your son Solomon.","Thoi noh, na dang ei năm tơ âu bĕ, inh tơbăt kơ ih trong wă kơ ih pơklaih tơdrong arih ih kơdih păng pơklaih tơdrong arih kon drŏ-nglo ih Sôlômôn."
"Go immediately to King David and say to him, ‘Did you not, my lord, O king, swear to your maidservant, saying, “Assuredly your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne“? Why then has Adonijah become king?’","Ih năm hloi bĕ tơ pơtao Đawit păng khan kơ sư: Ơ pơtao, yŏng inh!

"Then, while you are still talking there with the king, I also will come in after you and confirm your words.”","Kơplah ih oei tơ noh pơma dơnuh hăm pơtao, inh gô mơ̆t kiơ̆ ih păng wă pơsĭt dôm nơ̆r ih.”"
"So Bathsheba went into the chamber to the king. (Now the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was serving the king.)","Na, yă Batsêba năm tơ lăm anih pơtao. Pơtao đĭ kră dêh boih. Đei Abisak drŏ-kăn bơngai Sunamit awih awăn kơ pơtao"
"And Bathsheba bowed and did homage to the king. Then the king said, “What is your wish?”","yă Batsêba năm drap kơkuh kơ pơtao Na pơtao jet: “Ih wă tơdrong kiơ?”"
"Then she said to him, “My lord, you swore by the LORD your God to your maidservant, saying, ‘Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.’","Yă Batsêba tơl: “Ơ pơtao, ih đei pơkă pơkăm boih hăm inh đam ih, hăm anăn Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ih: ‘Sôlômôn kon drŏ-nglo inh gô pơm pơtao tơplih inh, sư gô hơ-oei kơpal tang-dŏ pơtao inh.’"
"So now, look! Adonijah has become king; and now, my lord the king, you do not know about it.","Mă-lei, ơ pơtao yŏng inh, dang ei Adonija pơm pơtao mă ih ưh kơ băt ôh tơdrong noh"
"He has sacrificed oxen and fattened cattle and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the sons of the king, Abiathar the priest, and Joab the commander of the army; but Solomon your servant he has not invited.","Sư pơyơ̆r boih tơmam soi hăm rơmo tơno, rơmo dăm bek păng triu lơ dêh păng sư kư̆m đei krao wơ̆n đĭ-đăng kon drŏ-nglo pơtao, 'bok soi Abiathar păng Jôap yŏng linh, mă-lei đam ih Sôlômôn noh sư ưh kơ wơ̆n ôh."
"And as for you, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, that you should tell them who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.","Ơ pơtao yŏng inh, dang ei măt bơngai Isơrael oei lăng tơ ih ngăl wă răp gô ih roi ăn kơ lu sư băt bơngai bu wă hơ-oei kơpal tang-dŏ pơtao tơplih ih."
"Otherwise it will happen, when my lord the king rests with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon will be counted as offenders.”","Dah ưh lăm minh năr ei kơnh ih yŏng pơtao inh lôch oei hơdai 'bok yă, lei đe gô jô̆ kơ nhi Sôlômôn pơm yoch”"
"And just then, while she was still talking with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.","Kơplah yă Batsêba oei pơma dơnuh hăm pơtao, Nathan bơngai khan lê̆ adrol mơ̆t."
"So they told the king, saying, “Here is Nathan the prophet.” And when he came in before the king, he bowed down before the king with his face to the ground.","Đe roi kơ pơtao: “Đei Nathan bơngai khan lê̆ adrol truh.” Nathan năm truh 'bơ̆t anăp pơtao kŭp kơ̆l drap kơkuh."
"And Nathan said, “My lord, O king, have you said, ‘Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne’?","Nathan khan: “Ơ pơtao ih hăm đei khan kơ Adônja gô hơ-oei kơpal tang-dŏ pơtao pơgơ̆r pơtrơp ih?"
"For he has gone down today, and has sacrificed oxen and fattened cattle and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king’s sons, and the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest; and look! They are eating and drinking before him; and they say, ‘Long live King Adonijah!’","Năr 'nâu sư jur năm pơyơ̆r tơmam soi rôp rơmo tơno, kon rơmo dăm bek păng triu lơ dêh, na sư kư̆m đei krao wơ̆n đĭ-đăng kon drŏ-nglo pơtao, Jôap yŏng linh, 'bok soi Abiathar; lu sư oei et sa 'bơ̆t anăp Adonija păng jreo ôr 'bơ̆r re khan: ‘Adonija pơtao arih sot!’"
"But he has not invited me—me your servant—nor Zadok the priest, nor Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, nor your servant Solomon.","Mă-lei sư ưh kơ krao wơ̆n inh đam ih, dah 'bok soi Sadok, Bênaia kon drŏ-nglo Jêhôiada, păng Sôlômôn đam ih ôh."
"Has this thing been done by my lord the king, and you have not told your servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?”","Ơ pơtao, tơdrong 'nâu hăm trŏ kơ đơ̆ng ih ăn? Păng ih kư̆m ưh kơ ăn kơ lu đĭch đam ih băt bơngai wă pơm pơtao pơtrơp ih, hơ-oei kơpal tang-dŏ ih?”"
"Then King David answered and said, “Call Bathsheba to me.” So she came into the king’s presence and stood before the king.","Pơtao Đawit khan: “Krao Batsêba năm tơ âu;” na đe krao yă Batsêba mơ̆t, dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp pơtao"
"And the king took an oath and said, “As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my life from every distress","Pơtao pơkă pơkăm khan: “Hơpơi Kră Yang mă oei arih, Tơ'ngla pơklaih inh đơ̆ng dôm tơdrong pơmat-tat truh."
"just as I swore to you by the LORD God of Israel, saying, ‘Assuredly Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place,’ so I certainly will do this day.”","Thoi inh đei pơkă pơkăm boih hăm ih hăm anăn Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael tơpă: Sôlômôn kon drŏ-nglo ih gô pơm pơtao pơgơ̆r pơtrơp inh, sư gô hơ-oei kơpal tang-dŏ tơplih inh, năr 'nâu boih inh gô pơm pơkeh tơdrong noh.”"
"Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and paid homage to the king, and said, “Let my lord King David live forever!”","Yă Batsêba kŭp kơ̆l drap tơ teh kơkuh kơ pơtao Đawit păng khan: “Hơpơi yŏng inh pơtao Đawit arih sot!”"
"And King David said, “Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.” So they came before the king.","Pơtao Đawit khan: “Krao 'bok soi Sadok, krao Nathan bơngai khan lê̆ adrol păng krao Bênaia kon drŏ-nglo Jêhôiada năm tơ âu;” thoi noh na lu sư năm tơ anăp pơtao."
"The king also said to them, “Take with you the servants of your lord, and have Solomon my son ride on my own mule, and take him down to Gihon.","Pơtao khan kơ lu sư: “Chông ba lu đĭch đam inh mă yŏng tơ'ngla iĕm, hơdai hăm iĕm na iĕm hiŏng atŏk Sôlômôn kon drŏ-nglo inh kơpal aseh dăm inh, ba sư truh tơ pơlei Gihôn"
"There let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him king over Israel; and blow the horn, and say, ‘Long live King Solomon!’","Tơ noh bre 'bok soi Sadok hăm Nathan bơngai khan lê̆ adrol tuh đak rơmă 'bâu phu pôk sư pơm pơtao Isơrael, lu iĕm hlôm tơgiĕp na jreo re khan: Pơtao Sôlômôn arih sot!"
"Then you shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit on my throne, and he shall be king in my place. For I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and Judah.”","Iĕm năm kiơ̆ đơ̆ng rŏng sư tŏk truh tơ anih pơtao, sư gô hơ-oei kơpal tang-dŏ pơtao pơgơ̆r pơtrơp inh.

"Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king and said, “Amen! May the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.","Bênaia kon drŏ-nglo Jêhôiada tơl pơtao, “A-men! Apinh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ih yŏng inh, kư̆m khan thoi noh mơ̆n."
"As the LORD has been with my lord the king, even so may He be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David.”","Kră Yang oei hơdai hăm ih mă yŏng inh thoi yơ, apinh Kră Yang kư̆m oei hơdai Sôlômôn thoi noh mơ̆n, păng pơm ăn tang-dŏ pơtao sư tih hloh kơ tang-dŏ pơtao Đawit yŏng inh dơ̆ng.”"
"So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon ride on King David’s mule, and took him to Gihon.","Thoi noh 'bok soi Sadok, Nathan bơngai khan lê̆ adrol, Bênaia kon drŏ-nglo Jêhôiada păng lu bơngai Kêrêthit, lu bơngai Phêlêthit jur năm hiŏng atŏk Sôlômôn tơ kơpal kơdŭ aseh dăm pơtao Đawit, klaih kơ noh năm ba sư tơ pơlei Gihôn."
"Then Zadok the priest took a horn of oil from the tabernacle and anointed Solomon. And they blew the horn, and all the people said, “Long live King Solomon!”","Tơ noh 'bok soi Sadok iŏk hơke mong đak pơgang 'bâu phu đơ̆ng lăm bơsŭn anih akŭm tuh kơpal kơ̆l Sôlômôn.

"And all the people went up after him; and the people played the flutes and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth seemed to split with their sound.","Đĭ-đăng kon pơlei pơla kiơ̆ đơ̆ng rŏng, hlôm 'lal chhôk hơnôk dêh tơpă, teh mah pơpơ̆ kyĭng kyơ̆ng đơ̆ng jơwa nơ̆r lu sư ôr jreo."
"Now Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they finished eating.

"While he was still speaking, there came Jonathan, the son of Abiathar the priest.

"Then Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, “No! Our lord King David has made Solomon king.","Mă-lei Jônathan tơl: “Ưh ôh, pơtao Đawit yŏng bơ̆n pôk ăn kơ Sôlômôn pơm pơtao boih."
"The king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites; and they have made him ride on the king’s mule.","Pơtao Đawit đei wơh 'bok soi Sadok, Nathan bơngai khan lê̆ adrol, Bênaia kon drŏ-nglo Jêhôiada, lu bơngai Kêrêthit păng lu bơngai Phelêthit kiơ̆ Sôlômôn, đơ̆ng noh lu sư hiŏng atŏk Sôlômôn tơ kơpal aseh dăm pơtao."
"So Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon; and they have gone up from there rejoicing, so that the city is in an uproar.

"Also Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom.","Sôlômôn hơ-oei kơpal tang-dŏ pơtao."
"And moreover the king’s servants have gone to bless our lord King David, saying, ‘May God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and may He make his throne greater than your throne.’ Then the king bowed himself on the bed.","Lu đĭch đam pơtao năm sơkat pŭn hiôk ăn kơ pơtao Đawit yŏng bơ̆n, lu sư khan: ‘Apinh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ih ăn kơ anăn Sôlômôn ư-ang tih hloh kơ anăn ih, ăn kơ tang-dŏ pơtao sư tih hloh kơ tang-dŏ pơtao.’ Đawit kŭp kơ̆l kơkuh 'bơ̆t giơng sư 'bĭch"

"So all the guests who were with Adonijah were afraid, and arose, and each one went his way.","Kơplah noh đĭ-đăng lu bơngai mă năm et sa hơdai hăm Adonija hli tơrơ, rim 'nu lu sư lĕch brŏk kơdih kơdih."

"And it was told Solomon, saying, “Indeed Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon; for look, he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying, ‘Let King Solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.’ ”","Đei bơngai năm tơbăt ăn kơ Sôlômôn: “Adonija hli kơ ih, to sư oei rôp kơjăp hơke chơnang soi păng khan: Rŏ kơ pơtao Sôlômôn pơkă pơkăm hăm inh mă đĭch đam sư khan sư ưh kơ đei pơlôch inh ôh hăm đao gưm.”"
"Then Solomon said, “If he proves himself a worthy man, not one hair of him shall fall to the earth; but if wickedness is found in him, he shall die.”","Sôlômôn tơl: “Tơdah sư arih sa pơm 'lơ̆ng tơpăt lei mă minh dăng sŏk đơ̆ng kơ̆l sư ưh kơ đei huŏng ôh tơ teh, mă-lei tơdah đe 'bôh sư pơm yoch sư gô lôch.”"
"So King Solomon sent them to bring him down from the altar.

However, the kingdom has been turned over, and has become my brother’s; for it was his from the LORD.","Sư pơma: “Ih băt boih dêh char pơtao 'nâu trŏ kơ inh pơgơ̆r ră păng đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael chang wă kơ 'bôh inh pơgơ̆r ngăl, mă-lei dang ei dêh char âu jing oh inh pơgơ̆r, yua kơ đơ̆ng Kră Yang ăn kơ sư."
"Now I ask one petition of you; do not deny me.” And she said to him, “Say it.”","Dang ei inh đei minh tơdrong wă apinh ih, ih 'nĕ kơ sơngah.” Yă Batsêba tơl: “Ih pơma bĕ.”"
"Then he said, “Please speak to King Solomon, for he will not refuse you, that he may give me Abishag the Shunammite as wife.”","Adonija khan: “Apinh ih năm apinh pơtao Sôlômôn, sư ưh kơ sơngah ôh tơdah ih apinh sư, ăn kơ inh iŏk Abisak bơngai Sunamit noh pơm akăn.”"
"So Bathsheba said, “Very well, I will speak for you to the king.”","Yă Batsêba tơl: Ŏ ah, inh gô roi kơ pơtao tơdrong ih wă noh."
"Bathsheba therefore went to King Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her and bowed down to her, and sat down on his throne and had a throne set for the king’s mother; so she sat at his right hand.","Yă Batsêba năm tơ'bơ̆p pơtao Sôlômôn wă roi ăn kơ sư tơdrong Adonija wă noh, na pơtao Sôlômôn iung năm sơng păng kŭp kơ̆l kơkuh kơ mĕ sư, đơ̆ng noh sư hơ-oei tơ tang-dŏ pơtao sư păng athei đe iŏk ăn kơ mĕ sư tang-dŏ wă kơ hơ-oei, na mĕ sư hơ-oei gah 'ma kơ sư."
"Then she said, “I desire one small petition of you; do not refuse me.” And the king said to her, “Ask it, my mother, for I will not refuse you.”","Yă Batsêba roi ăn kơ pơtao: “Inh đei minh tơdrong iĕ ioch wă apinh ih kon dăm, ih 'nĕ kơ sơngah.” Pơtao tơl: “Ơ mĕ, ih wă apinh kiơ?

"So she said, “Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as wife.”","Na mĕ sư khan: “Apinh ih ăn kơ Adonija 'nhŏng ih iŏk Abisak bơngai Sunimit pơm akăn.”"
"And King Solomon answered and said to his mother, “Now why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him the kingdom also—for he is my older brother—for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.”","Mă-lei pơtao Sôlômôn tơl mĕ sư: “Liơ ih apinh Abisak bơngai drŏ-kăn Sunamit ăn kơ Adonija pơm akăn?

"Then King Solomon swore by the LORD, saying, “May God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life!","Pơtao Sôlômôn yua hăm anăn Kră Yang pơkăm khan: “Apinh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei pơm kơ inh phak inh mă trăp thoi Sư wă, tơdah Adonija ưh kơ lôch ôh yua kơ tơdrong sư apinh 'nâu."
"Now therefore, as the LORD lives, who has confirmed me and set me on the throne of David my father, and who has established a house for me, as He promised, Adonijah shall be put to death today!”","Na dang ei kiơ̆ thoi Kră Yang arih Tơ'ngla pơjing inh păng ăn kơ inh hơ-oei 'bơ̆t tang-dŏ pơtao Đawit 'bă inh, păng pơjing ăn kơ inh minh pôm hnam kiơ̆ thoi nơ̆r sư đei pơkă boih, gô pơlôch Adonija năr 'nâu.”"
"So King Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he struck him down, and he died.","Thoi noh pơtao Sôlômôn wơh Bênaia kon drŏ-nglo Jêhôiada năm koh pơlôch Adonija hloi."
"And to Abiathar the priest the king said, “Go to Anathoth, to your own fields, for you are deserving of death; but I will not put you to death at this time, because you carried the ark of the Lord GOD before my father David, and because you were afflicted every time my father was afflicted.”","Pơtao Sôlômôn khan kơ 'bok soi Abiathar: “Ih athei brŏk tơ pơlei Anathôt, anih ih jang sa, ih trŏ kơ lôch ră, mă-lei năr âu inh ưh kơ pơlôch ih ôh, yua kơ ih tung Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'bơ̆t anăp Đawit 'bă inh păng kư̆m wang pŭ tơdrong gleh pơmat hơdai hăm 'bă inh.”"
"So Solomon removed Abiathar from being priest to the LORD, that he might fulfill the word of the LORD which He spoke concerning the house of Eli at Shiloh.","Na Sôlômôn puh lê̆ Abiathar, ưh pă ăn sư pơm 'bok soi kơ Kră Yang dơ̆ng, noh wă pơsĭt nơ̆r Kră Yang đei pơma khan lê̆ gah adrĕch Hêli tơ pơlei Silô."
"Then news came to Joab, for Joab had defected to Adonijah, though he had not defected to Absalom. So Joab fled to the tabernacle of the LORD, and took hold of the horns of the altar.","Tơdrong 'nâu kơtơ̆ng truh tơ Jôap, yua kơ sư kiơ̆ khŭl Adonija, mă khan sư ưh kơ kiơ̆ khŭl Apsalôm ră, na sư kơdâu năm tơ bơsŭn anih hnam akŭm Kră Yang păng sư năm rôp hơke mum chơnang soi."
"And King Solomon was told, “Joab has fled to the tabernacle of the LORD; there he is, by the altar.” Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, “Go, strike him down.”","Đe năm roi kơ pơtao Sôlômôn khan: “Jôap kơdâu đơ̆ng âu boih năm tơ bơsŭn anih akŭm Kră Yang to dang ei sư oei rôp hơke 'bơ̆t mum chơnang soi.” Sôlômôn athei Bênaia kon drŏ-nglo Jêhôiada khan: “Ih năm koh pơlôch sư bĕ.”"
"So Benaiah went to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said to him, “Thus says the king, ‘Come out!’ ” And he said, “No, but I will die here.” And Benaiah brought back word to the king, saying, “Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.”","Bênaia năm tơ bơsŭn anih akŭm Kră Yang, sư khan kơ Jôap: “Pơtao khan: Lĕch bĕ đơ̆ng âu.” Jôap tơl: “Inh ưh kơ lĕch, inh gô lôch 'bơ̆t dâu.” Bênaia năm roi ăn kơ pơtao: “Inh khan boih kơ Jôap, sư khan sư ưh kơ lĕch.”"
"Then the king said to him, “Do as he has said, and strike him down and bury him, that you may take away from me and from the house of my father the innocent blood which Joab shed.","Pơtao Sôlômôn khan: “Pơm bĕ thoi sư nơ̆r khan.

"So the LORD will return his blood on his head, because he struck down two men more righteous and better than he, and killed them with the sword—Abner the son of Ner, the commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, the commander of the army of Judah—though my father David did not know it.","Kră Yang gô pơm tơwih kơ Jôap đêl sư pơlôch tuh pham tuh plơ̆ tơ kơ̆l sư dơ̆ng, mă-lei Đawit 'bă inh, ưh kơ băt sư pơlôch 'bar 'nu bơngai 'lơ̆ng tơpăt hloh kơ sư, hăm đao gưm noh bre Apner kon drŏ-nglo Nêr, yŏng linh bơngai Isơrael păng Amasa kon drŏ-nglo Jêther, yŏng linh bơngai Juđa."
"Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab and upon the head of his descendants forever. But upon David and his descendants, upon his house and his throne, there shall be peace forever from the LORD.”","Thoi noh pham bre noh gô tuh tơ kơpal kơ̆l Jôap păng tơ kơpal kơ̆l adrĕch adrung sư ling-lang; mă-lei Đawit păng adrĕch adrung sư, hnam dơnŏ, tang-dŏ pơtao sư Kră Yang gô ăn đei tơdrong hiôk-hian ling-lang.”"
"So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and struck and killed him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.","Na Bênaia, kon drŏ-nglo Jêhôiada, tŏk năm pơlôch Jôap păng đe 'bŭ sư tơ teh sư lăm char glă."
"The king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his place over the army, and the king put Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar.","Pơtao Sôlômôn pôk Bênaia kon drŏ-nglo Jêhôiada pơm yŏng linh tơplih Jôap, pôk Sadok pơm 'bok soi tơplih Abiathar."
"Then the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, “Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and dwell there, and do not go out from there anywhere.","Đơ̆ng noh pơtao Sôlômôn wơh đe năm krao Simei păng khan kơ sư: “Ih athei pơm hnam ih lăm pơlei Jêrusalem oei tơ noh 'nĕ chă lĕch năm tơ nai."
"For it shall be, on the day you go out and cross the Brook Kidron, know for certain you shall surely die; your blood shall be on your own head.”","Yua kơ năr ayơ ih lĕch đơ̆ng noh tŏk hlôi kơ thong đak Sêdrôn ih gô lôch: Pham ih gô tuh plơ̆ tơ kơpal kơ̆l ih.”"
"And Shimei said to the king, “The saying is good.

"Now it happened at the end of three years, that two slaves of Shimei ran away to Achish the son of Maachah, king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, “Look, your slaves are in Gath!”","Lăp truh pêng sơnăm đei 'bar 'nu đĭch Simei kơdâu jăk tơ hnam Akis kon drŏ-nglo Maaka pơtao pơlei Gat.

"So Shimei arose, saddled his donkey, and went to Achish at Gath to seek his slaves. And Shimei went and brought his slaves from Gath.","Simei iung hao aseh năm tơ pơlei Gat, truh tơ hnam Akis chă đĭch đam sư. Na chă 'bôh bơih sư chông ba 'bar 'nu đĭch đam sư 'noh brŏk."
"And Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had come back.","Đe năm roi ăn kơ pơtao Sôlômôn, Simei lĕch đơ̆ng pơlei Jêrusalem sư năm tơ pơlei Gat păng sư brŏk bơih."
"Then the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, “Did I not make you swear by the LORD, and warn you, saying, ‘Know for certain that on the day you go out and travel anywhere, you shall surely die’? And you said to me, ‘The word I have heard is good.’","Pơtao Sôlômôn athei đe krao Simei păng khan: “Inh hăm đei athei ih pơkă hăm anăn Kră Yang păng inh pơkă păng khan kơ ih: ‘Ih athei băt tơdah năr ayơ ih lĕch đơ̆ng pơlei Jêrusalem na năm tơ anih nai, ih gô lôch.’ Ih kư̆m đei pơkăm hăm inh: ‘Tơdrong ih pơkă 'noh 'lơ̆ng dêh, inh gô chu ih.’"
"Why then have you not kept the oath of the LORD and the commandment that I gave you?”","Thoi noh yua kơ kiơ ih ưh kơ wei răk nơ̆r ih pơkă hăm anăn Kră Yang păng nơ̆r inh đei pơkă bơih kơ ih?”"
"The king said moreover to Shimei, “You know, as your heart acknowledges, all the wickedness that you did to my father David; therefore the LORD will return your wickedness on your own head.","Pơtao Sôlômôn khan dơ̆ng kơ Simei: “Ih băt bơih păng oei 'blŏk mơ̆n lăm jơhngơ̆m dôm tơdrong ih pơm kơnê̆ kơ Đawit, 'bă inh.

"But King Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD forever.”","Mă-lei pơtao Sôlômôn gô đei tơdrong pŭn hiôk păng tang-dŏ pơtao Đawit oei kơjăp ling-lang 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang.”"
"So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he went out and struck him down, and he died. Thus the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.","Thoi noh 'bok pơtao athei Bênaia kon drŏ-nglo Jêhôiada năm pơlôch Simei; na Bênaia lĕch năm koh pơlôch hloi Simei.

"Now Solomon made a treaty with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and married Pharaoh’s daughter; then he brought her to the City of David until he had finished building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall all around Jerusalem.","Sôlômôn pơgơ̆p hơdai hăm Pharaôn dêh Êyiptơ, iŏk kon adruh Pharaôn pơm akăn, chông ba sư brŏk oei tơ pơlei Đawit, oei tơ noh dĭng truh sư keh pơm hnam pơtao sư, pơm hnam akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang păng man dur tăp dăr pơlei Jêrusalem."
"Meanwhile the people sacrificed at the high places, because there was no house built for the name of the LORD until those days.","Lu kon pơlei oei pơyơ̆r tơmam soi tơ anih groi kơjung 'mơ̆i, yua kơ kơplah noh pơtao tam mă pơm hnam akŭm kơkuh kơ anăn Kră Yang."
"And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of his father David, except that he sacrificed and burned incense at the high places.","Sôlômôn 'mêm yom kơ Kră Yang păng yak kiơ̆ dôm lu tơdrong juăt Đawit, 'bă sư, mă-lei sư pơyơ̆r tơmam soi păng soh 'long 'bâu phu tơ anih groi kơjung."
"Now the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that was the great high place: Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar.","Pơtao Sôlômôn năm truh tơ pơlei Gibeôn wă pơyơ̆r tơmam soi, yua kơ tơ anih soi kơpal groi kơjung mă kăl dêh.

"At Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, “Ask! What shall I give you?”","Tơ pơlei Gibeôn Kră Yang tơ'bôh akâu sư kơ Sôlômôn lăm tơdrong apo kiơ̆ kơmăng Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei khan: “Apinh bĕ tơdrong kiơ ih wă kơ Inh ăn kơ ih.”"
"And Solomon said: “You have shown great mercy to Your servant David my father, because he walked before You in truth, in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with You; You have continued this great kindness for him, and You have given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.","Sôlômôn tơl: “Ih đei tơ'bôh bơih tơdrong 'mêm mơnat tih kơ đĭch đam ih Đawit, 'bă inh, yua kơ sư đei đon lui păng jơhngơ̆m đon tơpăt 'bơ̆t anăp Ih: Ih oei tơ'bôh tơdrong 'mêm mơnat tih, na ăn kơ sư đei minh 'nu kon drŏ-nglo hơ-oei kơpal tang-dŏ pơtao sư truh năr 'nâu."
"Now, O LORD my God, You have made Your servant king instead of my father David, but I am a little child; I do not know how to go out or come in.","Dang ei ơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei inh, Ih ăn bơih kơ inh đĭch đam Ih pơm pơtao pơtrơp đơ̆ng Đawit, 'bă inh; mă-lei inh bơngai oei 'lơ̆p, ưh kơ băt wă pơgơ̆r teh đak thoi yơ."
"And Your servant is in the midst of Your people whom You have chosen, a great people, too numerous to be numbered or counted.","Inh đĭch đam Ih oei tŏk-bŏk kon pơlei pơla mă Ih rơih bơih, minh khŭl bơngai lơ kơdrâ̆m ưh kơ kĕ jô̆."
"Therefore give to Your servant an understanding heart to judge Your people, that I may discern between good and evil. For who is able to judge this great people of Yours?”","Thoi noh apinh Ih ăn kơ inh mă đĭch đam Ih âu tơdrong gơh hơgei, wă kơ gơh sek tơlang tơdrong kon pơlei pơla ih, wă kơ inh băt kơnăl tơdrong 'lơ̆ng, tơdrong kơnê̆; yua kơ bu gơh kĕ sek tơlang kơ lu kon pơlei pơla lơ dêh 'nâu?”"
"The speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.","Kră Yang lăp đon dêh kơ Sôlômôn apinh noh."
"Then God said to him: “Because you have asked this thing, and have not asked long life for yourself, nor have asked riches for yourself, nor have asked the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice","Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei khan kơ sư: “Yua kơ ih apinh tơdrong 'nâu, ưh kơ apinh kơ ih tơdrong arih sot, tơdrong mơdrŏng tih kư̆m ưh kơ apinh tơdrong kĕ jei blah pơrăm lu bơngai ayăt kơ ih, mă-lei ih apinh tơdrong hlôh wao gơh hơgei wă kơ gơh sek tơlang trŏ."
"behold, I have done according to your words; see, I have given you a wise and understanding heart, so that there has not been anyone like you before you, nor shall any like you arise after you.","'Nâu, Inh ăn tơdrong ih apinh, ăn kơ ih hlôh wao gơh hơgei, dĭng mah lu bơngai adrol kơ ih ưh kơ đei bu hơtŏ kơ ih păng lu bơngai đơ̆ng rŏng kơ ih kư̆m ưh kơ đei bu dang ih."
"And I have also given you what you have not asked: both riches and honor, so that there shall not be anyone like you among the kings all your days.","Hloh kơ noh dơ̆ng Inh gô ăn hloi kơ ih dôm tơdrong mă ih ưh kơ đei apinh, tơdrong mơdrŏng, tơdrong đe pơyom ư-ang, lăm đĭ chăl arih ih ưh kơ đei pơtao bu kĕ tam ih."
"So if you walk in My ways, to keep My statutes and My commandments, as your father David walked, then I will lengthen your days.”","Tơdah ih yak năm kiơ̆ trong Inh păng wei răk tơdrong juăt păng nơ̆r Inh tơtă thoi Đawit, 'bă ih, lei Inh gô pơthim ăn kơ ih arih sot soi.”"
"Then Solomon awoke; and indeed it had been a dream. And he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, offered up burnt offerings, offered peace offerings, and made a feast for all his servants.","Na Sôlômôn 'blơ̆ hơdơ̆r đơ̆ng tep mơn băt noh tơdrong apo.

"Now two women who were harlots came to the king, and stood before him.","Kơplah noh đei 'bar 'nu drŏ-kăn đi năm dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp pơtao."
"And one woman said, “O my lord, this woman and I dwell in the same house; and I gave birth while she was in the house.","Minh 'nu drŏ-kăn khan: Ơ 'bok pơtao! Nhi duch 'nâu oei hơdai minh pôm hnam, inh tơpŭ kơ minh 'nu kon drŏ-nglo, sư kư̆m oei lăm noh mơ̆n."
"Then it happened, the third day after I had given birth, that this woman also gave birth. And we were together; no one was with us in the house, except the two of us in the house.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ inh tơpŭ 'noh pêng năr sư kư̆m tơpŭ mơ̆n, 'bar 'nu nhi đĕch oei lăm hnam, ưh kơ đei bu nai ôh oei hơdai hăm nhi lăm hnam."
"And this woman’s son died in the night, because she lay on him.","Kơplah oei tep kơmăng, sư kơtĭt 'bơm nge drŏ-nglo sư lôch hloi"
"So she arose in the middle of the night and took my son from my side, while your maidservant slept, and laid him in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.","Truh tơ tŏk-bŏk măng kơplah inh mă đĭch đam ih oei tep hlơ̆k, sư iung hiŏng iŏk kon nge drŏ-nglo inh oei brom 'bơ̆t kơtơh inh, đơ̆ng noh sư năm ming lê̆ nge drŏ-nglo sư mă lôch bơih noh 'bơ̆t kơtơh inh."
"And when I rose in the morning to nurse my son, there he was, dead.

"Then the other woman said, “No! But the living one is my son, and the dead one is your son.” And the first woman said, “No!

"Then the king said, “Bring me a sword.” So they brought a sword before the king.","Pơtao khan dơ̆ng; “Lei iŏk ăn kơ inh đao tơ âu,” na đe iŏk ăn kơ sư đao."
"And the king said, “Divide the living child in two, and give half to one, and half to the other.”","Pơtao khan: “Blah asong kon nge mă oei arih 'nâu, minh pah ăn kơ bơngai 'nâu, minh pah ăn kơ bơngai 'noh,”"
"Then the woman whose son was living spoke to the king, for she yearned with compassion for her son; and she said, “O my lord, give her the living child, and by no means kill him!” But the other said, “Let him be neither mine nor yours, but divide him.”","Mă-lei mĕ kon nge mă oei arih 'noh ưh kơeng, yua kơ sư 'mêm mơnat kơ kon sư dêh na sư khan kơ pơtao: “Ơ yŏng inh!

"And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had rendered; and they feared the king, for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to administer justice.","Đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael kơtơ̆ng tơdrong pơtao sek tơlang noh lu sư hli yom ư-ang kơ pơtao, yua kơ lu sư 'bôh pơtao đei tơdrong gơh hơgei đơ̆ng Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei, wă kơ sek tơlang tơpăt."

"Then Solomon sent to Hiram, saying","Sôlômôn kư̆m tơwih nơ̆r kơ pơtao Hiram khan"
"You know how my father David could not build a house for the name of the LORD his God because of the wars which were fought against him on every side, until the LORD put his foes under the soles of his feet.","“Ih băt bơih yua kơ tơblah wang jơ̆p-jang tăp dăr, na Đawit 'bă inh sư tam mă gơh pơm Hnam Akŭm kơ anăn Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei sư, dĭng truh tơ Kră Yang ăn kơ sư blah pơjuă lu ayăt tơ ala jơ̆ng sư."
"But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side; there is neither adversary nor evil occurrence.","Mă-lei dang ei Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei inh, ăn boih kơ inh rơngei hiôk-hian tăp pang pă đei bu blah păng kư̆m pă đei tơdrong kiơ truh."
"And behold, I propose to build a house for the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spoke to my father David, saying, “Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place, he shall build the house for My name.”","Thoi noh na inh wă pơm Hnam Akŭm ăn kơ anăn Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei inh kiơ̆ thoi Kră Yang khan kơ 'bă inh Đawit sơ̆: Inh gô ăn kơ kon drŏ-nglo ih pơm pơtao pơtrơp đơ̆ng ih, sư gô pơm Hnam Akŭm kơ anăn Inh."
"Now therefore, command that they cut down cedars for me from Lebanon; and my servants will be with your servants, and I will pay you wages for your servants according to whatever you say. For you know there is none among us who has skill to cut timber like the Sidonians.","Thoi noh na ih athei lu đĭch đam ih kăl tơgŭm inh 'long hơngo đơ̆ng char Liban, na inh kư̆m gô athei lu đĭch đam inh hai dai wang jang tơgŭm đĭch đam ih, inh gô apah lu đĭch đam ih gô mơ̆ng kơ đơ̆ng ih hơgăt, yua kơ ih kư̆m băt mơ̆n lu nhôn ưh kơ juăt kơ kăl 'long thoi lu kon pơlei Siđôn ôh.”"
"So it was, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, for He has given David a wise son over this great people!","Lăp pơtao kơtơ̆ng nơ̆r Sôlômôn pơma thoi noh, na sư hiôk dêh sư khan: Kơkuh bơnê kơ Kră Yang năr 'nâu Sư ăn kơ Đawit đei minh 'nu kon drŏ-nglo gơh hơgei tôm tơdrong wă pơgơ̆r kon pơlei pơla tih dêh thoi âu."
"Then Hiram sent to Solomon, saying: I have considered the message which you sent me, and I will do all you desire concerning the cedar and cypress logs.","Na Hiram sư wơh bơngai năm roi kơ Sôlômôn: “Inh kơtơ̆ng bơih nơ̆r ih wơh lu đĭch đam ih pơtruh kơ inh kiơ̆ thoi ih wă chă kăl 'long hơngo, hơngo hla iĕ."
"My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon to the sea; I will float them in rafts by sea to the place you indicate to me, and will have them broken apart there; then you can take them away. And you shall fulfill my desire by giving food for my household.","Lu đĭch đam inh gô dui hor 'long noh đơ̆ng char Liban ba tơ đak dơsĭ, na chô̆ pơm thoi thŏng-nan chơ ăn kơ ih truh tơ anih mă ih tơhlâu ăn kơ inh.

"Then Hiram gave Solomon cedar and cypress logs according to all his desire.","Thoi noh Hiram kăl ăn kơ Sôlômôn 'long hơngo păng 'long hơngo hla iĕ kiơ̆ thoi sư apinh wă."
"And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand kors of wheat as food for his household, and twenty kors of pressed oil. Thus Solomon gave to Hiram year by year.","Gah Sôlômôn sư ăn kơ hnam Hiram 'bar-jĭt kơthŭng 'ba mi (kôr) wă pơm tơmam sŏng sa kơ đĭ ŭnh hnam pơtao Hiram păng kư̆m ăn 'bar-jĭt kơthŭng đak rơmă ôliwơ, rim sơnăm Sôlômôn ăn kơ pơtao Hiram thoi noh."
"So the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as He had promised him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a treaty together.","Kră Yang tuh ăn kơ pơtao Sôlômôn tơdrong gơh hơgei hlôh wao kiơ̆ thoi Kră Yang đei pơkă hăm sư; Hiram măr sư Sôlômôn pơgơ̆p băl kơjăp 'lơ̆ng dêh."
"Then King Solomon raised up a labor force out of all Israel; and the labor force was thirty thousand men.","Pơtao Sôlômôn krao đĭ lu bơngai Isơrael, năm jang pơdŭ 'long đei pêng-jĭt rơbâu 'nu bơngai năm."
"And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month in shifts: they were one month in Lebanon and two months at home; Adoniram was in charge of the labor force.","Pơtao wơh lu sư tơplih băl năm tơ char Liban, rim khei mơjĭt-rơbâu 'nu bơngai.

"Solomon had seventy thousand who carried burdens, and eighty thousand who quarried stone in the mountains","Pơtao Sôlômôn đei tơpơh-jĭt rơbâu 'nu bơngai tung tôi, păng tơhngam-rơbâu 'nu bơngai teh tơmo kơpal kông."
"besides three thousand three hundred from the chiefs of Solomon’s deputies, who supervised the people who labored in the work.","Kŭm oei đei pêng-rơbâu pêng-hrĕng 'nu, mă pơtao Sôlômôn pơjao wei-lăng pơgơ̆r tơdrong jang man pơdơ̆ng păng tơwơh băl jang."
"And the king commanded them to quarry large stones, costly stones, and hewn stones, to lay the foundation of the temple.","Kiơ̆ pơtao Sôlômôn athei lu sư teh blah tơmo tih tơmo gĭt wă pơm jrăng hơnă Hnam Akŭm."
"So Solomon’s builders, Hiram’s builders, and the Gebalites quarried them; and they prepared timber and stones to build the temple.","Lu bơngai thơ̆ jang kơ pơtao Sôlômôn păng pơtao Hiram, hăm lu bơngai Gêbal, lu sư teh tơmo păng kăl 'long wă pơm tơiung Hnam Akŭm."
"And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.","Lăm sơnăm puăn-hrĕng tơhngam-jĭt đơ̆ng rŏng kơ lu bơngai Isơrael lĕch đơ̆ng dêh char Êyiptơ; sơnăm mă puăn lăm chăl Sôlômôn pơgơ̆r lu bơngai Isơrael, kơplah khei Siu wă khan khei mă 'bar, sư pơtơm pơdơ̆ng tơiung pơm Hnam akŭm Kră Yang."
"Now the house which King Solomon built for the LORD, its length was sixty cubits, its width twenty, and its height thirty cubits.","Hnam akŭm mă Sôlômôn pơm ăn kơ Kră Yang 'noh, tor sư pêng-jĭt hlok, wơ̆l sư mơjĭt păng kơjung sư mơjĭt-pơđăm hlok."
"The vestibule in front of the sanctuary of the house was twenty cubits long across the width of the house, and the width of the vestibule extended ten cubits from the front of the house.","Kơdeng gah anăp hnam tor sư mơjĭt hlok hơtŏ hăm wơ̆l Hnam akŭm, wơ̆l sư să pơđăm hlok."
"And he made for the house windows with beveled frames.","Sôlômôn sư kư̆m pơm 'măng-'mŏk Hnam akŭm pơkăp đei dơhlông găn."
"Against the wall of the temple he built chambers all around, against the walls of the temple, all around the sanctuary and the inner sanctuary. Thus he made side chambers all around it.","Tơ rok tơnăr Hnam akŭm, sư pơm anih tăp dăr păng anih rơgoh, sư kư̆m pơm lơ anih tăp dăr."
"The lowest chamber was five cubits wide, the middle was six cubits wide, and the third was seven cubits wide; for he made narrow ledges around the outside of the temple, so that the support beams would not be fastened into the walls of the temple.","Tăl ala să 'bar hlok minh puăt, tăl tŏk-bŏk să pêng hlok păng tăl mă pêng să pêng hlok minh puăt.

"And the temple, when it was being built, was built with stone finished at the quarry, so that no hammer or chisel or any iron tool was heard in the temple while it was being built.","Năr wă pơdơ̆ng hnam đe yua tơmo đơ̆ng lăm sơlŭng đe teh 'măn lê̆ adrol bơih, kơplah lu sư pơdơ̆ng tơiung ưh pă đei kơtơ̆ng re mut teh, păng re lu tơmam đe pơm păng bơsei."
"The doorway for the middle story was on the right side of the temple. They went up by stairs to the middle story, and from the middle to the third.","'Măng mơ̆t tơ anih ala gah cheng Hnam akŭm gah gơal, đe yua kung dăr kơdŭt hơbâu jur tŏk tơ anih tăl tŏk-bŏk, na gơh tŏk tơ tăl mă pêng."
"So he built the temple and finished it, and he paneled the temple with beams and boards of cedar.","Sư pơm Hnam akŭm păng pơkeh man noh. Sôlômôn sư roh tơpơng klơ̆p hăm tơ̆r 'long hơngo bri."
"And he built side chambers against the entire temple, each five cubits high; they were attached to the temple with cedar beams.","Sư kư̆m pơm lu anih rok tơnăr Hnam akŭm rim anih kơjung 'bar hlok minh puăt lu anih noh klep kơ Hnam akŭm hăm tơpung 'long hơngo."
"Then the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying","Đei nơ̆r Kră Yang khan kơ pơtao Sôlômôn"
"“Concerning this temple which you are building, if you walk in My statutes, execute My judgments, keep all My commandments, and walk in them, then I will perform My word with you, which I spoke to your father David.","“Gah Hnam akŭm mă ih oei pơm dang ei 'nâu, tơdah ih chu pơm kiơ̆ nơ̆r Inh tơtă păng chĕp răk dôm tơdrong juăt Inh bơtho khan, wei răk nơ̆r Inh tơtă păng pơm kiơ̆, lei inh gô pơsĭt lu nơ̆r inh đei pơkă kơ 'bă ih Đawit lăm chăl arih ih."
"And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake My people Israel.”","Inh gô oei hơdai lu bơngai Isơrael. Inh ưh kơ achăng lê̆ ôh bơngai Isơrael kon pơlei pơla inh.”"
"So Solomon built the temple and finished it.","Thoi noh pơtao Sôlômôn pơm Hnam akŭm păng pơm pơkeh."
"And he built the inside walls of the temple with cedar boards; from the floor of the temple to the ceiling he paneled the inside with wood; and he covered the floor of the temple with planks of cypress.","Pơ̆ng tơnăr hăm tơ̆r 'long hơngo gah lăm đơ̆ng hơnă truh tơ kơpal, lơ̆k hơnă hăm tơ̆r 'long hơngo hla iĕ."
"Then he built the twenty-cubit room at the rear of the temple, from floor to ceiling, with cedar boards; he built it inside as the inner sanctuary, as the Most Holy Place.","Pơtao iŏk 'long hơngo, sư pĕng pơgăn anih mơjĭt hlok lăm Hnam akŭm, đơ̆ng hơnă truh tơ bơbŭng, noh Anih Rơgoh đe krao Anih Rơgoh Hloh."
"And in front of it the temple sanctuary was forty cubits long.","'Bơ̆t anăp Anih 'Lơ̆ng Rơgoh, tor să kơjung 'bar-jĭt hlok"
"The inside of the temple was cedar, carved with ornamental buds and open flowers. All was cedar; there was no stone to be seen.","Tơnăr lăm Hnam akŭm pơm pơ̆ng hăm tơ̆r 'long hơngo ngăl, sư chhơ̆ chrek rup get đak păng pơkao 'nao tơlang, anih ayơ kư̆m pơ̆ng 'long dơnơ̆ng ngăl ưh kơ đei 'bôh tơmo ôh."
"And he prepared the inner sanctuary inside the temple, to set the ark of the covenant of the LORD there.","Pơtao kư̆m pơm hơmet Anih 'Lơ̆ng Rơgoh hloh wă tah hom tơdrong pơgơ̆p Kră Yang lăm noh."
"The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high. He overlaid it with pure gold, and overlaid the altar of cedar.","Lăm anih Rơgoh hloh noh tor sư mơjĭt hlok, wơ̆l sư mơjĭt hlok păng kơjung sư kư̆m lei-lăi mơjĭt hlok; sư lom anih Rơgoh hloh hăm maih rơgoh sư kư̆m lom chơnang soi hăm tơ̆r, 'long hơngo."
"So Solomon overlaid the inside of the temple with pure gold. He stretched gold chains across the front of the inner sanctuary, and overlaid it with gold.","Pơtao Sôlômôn lom tơ lăm Hnam akŭm hăm maih rơgoh. Sư iŏk glang maih dăng 'bơ̆t anăp Anih Rơgoh hloh, anih mă lom hăm maih."
"The whole temple he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the temple; also he overlaid with gold the entire altar that was by the inner sanctuary.","Sôlômôn kư̆m lom jơ̆p Hnam akŭm hăm maih; sư kư̆m lom đĭ chơnang soi hăm maih 'măn lăm Anih Rơgoh Hloh 'noh."
"Inside the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim of olive wood, each ten cubits high.","Sư kư̆m pơm lăm Anih Rơgoh Hloh noh 'bar tŏ rup chêrubim sư pơm hăm 'long ôliwơ kơjung sư pơđăm hlok."
"One wing of the cherub was five cubits, and the other wing of the cherub five cubits: ten cubits from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other.","Minh pah pơnăr chêrubim să 'bar hlok minh puăt, minh pah dơ̆ng kư̆m 'bar hlok minh puăt, na đơ̆ng pah âu truh tơ jih pah to pơnăr đei pơđăm hlok."
"And the other cherub was ten cubits; both cherubim were of the same size and shape.","Rup chêrubim mă 'bar kư̆m lei-lăi pơnăr sư kư̆m pơđăm hlok mơ̆n; 'bar tŏ chêrubim 'noh sư pơm tŏ ăi lei-lăi băl đĕch."
"The height of one cherub was ten cubits, and so was the other cherub.","Chêrubim kơjung sư pơđăm hlok. Chêrubim mă 'bar kư̆m lei-lăi."
"Then he set the cherubim inside the inner room; and they stretched out the wings of the cherubim so that the wing of the one touched one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall. And their wings touched each other in the middle of the room.","Sôlômôn dan lê̆ 'bar tŏ rup chêrubim oei bơyar pơnăr noh lăm Anih Rơgoh Hloh lăm Hnam akŭm.

"Also he overlaid the cherubim with gold.","'Bar tŏ chêrubim noh sư lom hăm maih."
"Then he carved all the walls of the temple all around, both the inner and outer sanctuaries, with carved figures of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers.","Tơ tơnăr tăp dăr kơ Hnam akŭm lăm Anih Rơgoh păng Anih Rơgoh Hloh sư chhơ̆ lu rup chêrubim, 'long gol, păng pơkao 'nao tơlang."
"And the floor of the temple he overlaid with gold, both the inner and outer sanctuaries.","Hơnă Hnam akŭm sư kư̆m tuh lơ̆k hăm maih, mă Anih Rơgoh dah Anih Rơgoh hloh."
"For the entrance of the inner sanctuary he made doors of olive wood; the lintel and doorposts were one-fifth of the wall.","Trong wă mơ̆t lăm Anih Rơgoh Hloh, sư pơm 'bar pah tơnang 'măng hăm tơ̆r 'long ôliwơ, 'long pơdơ̆ng đei pơđăm pah."
"The two doors were of olive wood; and he carved on them figures of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold; and he spread gold on the cherubim and on the palm trees.","'Bơ̆t 'bar pah tơnang 'măng pơm hăm 'long ôliwơ noh, sư chhơ̆ rup chêrubim, 'long gol păng pơkao 'nao tơlang, sư hling hăm maih tơ rup chêrubim păng 'bơ̆t rup 'long gol rup pơkao 'nao tơlang."
"So for the door of the sanctuary he also made doorposts of olive wood, one-fourth of the wall.","Trong mơ̆t tơ Anih Rơgoh, sư kư̆m pơm jrăng 'măng puăn pah hăm 'long ôliwơ"
"And the two doors were of cypress wood; two panels comprised one folding door, and two panels comprised the other folding door.","Sư kư̆m pơm 'bar hlak tơnang 'măng hăm 'long hơngo hla iĕ.

"Then he carved cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers on them, and overlaid them with gold applied evenly on the carved work.","Pơtao Sôlômôn sư chhơ̆ lu rup chêrubim, 'long gol păng pơkao 'nao tơlang, sư kư̆m bah hăm maih, lu trong rek đêl chhơ̆."
"And he built the inner court with three rows of hewn stone and a row of cedar beams.","Pơtao kư̆m man cham lăm Hnam akŭm đei pêng trong tơmo gĭt rang teh blah pơiel, păng roh minh trong tơpơng găn hăm 'long hơngo."
"In the fourth year the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid, in the month of Ziv.","Lăm sơnăm mă puăn, 'blep kơ khei Siu. Hnam akŭm Kră Yang man pơdơ̆ng jrăng."
"And in the eleventh year, in the month of Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was finished in all its details and according to all its plans. So he was seven years in building it.","Truh tơ sơnăm mă mơjĭt-mônh, 'blep kơ khei Bul wă khan khei tơhngam, đĭ-đăng dôm tơdrong jang man Hnam akŭm Kră Yang noh keh đang ngăl bơih kiơ̆ 'blep thoi đei hơgăt lê̆ adrol să iĕ, hơbŏ hnam noh.

"But Solomon took thirteen years to build his own house; so he finished all his house.","Sôlômôn pơm hnam pơtao sư keh đang lăm mơjĭt-pêng sơnăm."
"He also built the House of the Forest of Lebanon; its length was one hundred cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits, with four rows of cedar pillars, and cedar beams on the pillars.","Sư pơm hnam pơtao tơ Bri Liban tor sư pơđăm-jĭt hlok, wơ̆l sư 'bar-jĭt pơđăm hlok, kơjung sư mơjĭt-pơđăm hlok.

"And it was paneled with cedar above the beams that were on forty-five pillars, fifteen to a row.","Ala bơbŭng hnam pơtao sư pơ̆ng sap hăm tơ̆r 'long hơngo, đei puăn-jĭt pơđăm tŏ hơpok pơjăng, minh trong roh mơjĭt-pơđăm tŏ, sư pơ̆ng hơgơn 'bơ̆t kơ̆l jrăng."
"There were windows with beveled frames in three rows, and window was opposite window in three tiers.","Đei pêng trong 'măng-'mŏk sư pơrĕng tơklă băl, kư̆ kơ rim pêng tŏ 'măng-'mŏk sư minh khŭl."
"And all the doorways and doorposts had rectangular frames; and window was opposite window in three tiers.","Đĭ-đăng 'măng păng 'long dơ̆ng măng đei puăn hlak tơnang 'măng, tơklă băl, kư̆ pêng tŏ 'măng minh khŭl."
"He also made the Hall of Pillars: its length was fifty cubits, and its width thirty cubits; and in front of them was a portico with pillars, and a canopy was in front of them.","Sư pơm kơdeng hăm jrăng, kơdeng tor sư 'bar-jĭt pơđăm hlok, wơ̆l să sư mơjĭt-pơđăm hlok, gah anăp kơdeng âu sư đei jrăng pơrĕng gơweng păng đei dan bơbŭng."
"Then he made a hall for the throne, the Hall of Judgment, where he might judge; and it was paneled with cedar from floor to ceiling.","Sôlômôn sư kư̆m pơm minh pôm anih wă dan tang-dŏ pơtao; anih sư sek tơlang; đe krao Anih Trŏ Hơnơ̆ng, anih sek tơlang noh sư pơm hăm tơ̆r 'long hơngo.

"And the house where he dwelt had another court inside the hall, of like workmanship. Solomon also made a house like this hall for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had taken as wife.","Hnam mă pơtao Sôlômôn oei sư pơm gah rŏng kơ hnam tih 'noh. Sư man lei-lăi thoi noh mơ̆n.

"All these were of costly stones cut to size, trimmed with saws, inside and out, from the foundation to the eaves, and also on the outside to the great court.","Đĭ-đăng hnam pơtao âu, sư pơm păng tơmo gĭt ngăl, sư bŏk blah teh tơmo âu pơtŏ hơgăt trŏ kiơ̆ gah rŏng păng gah klak.

"The foundation was of costly stones, large stones, some ten cubits and some eight cubits.","Hơnă sư pơm hăm tơmo gĭt, tơmo să, minh hlak tor sư pơđăm hlok đei tơmo mơ'nah tor sư să puăn hlok."
"And above were costly stones, hewn to size, and cedar wood.","Sư lơ̆k hơnă hăm tơmo gĭt blah kăt kiơ̆ pơtŏ bơih. Sư lơ̆k hăm tơ̆r 'long hơngo kơpal."
"The great court was enclosed with three rows of hewn stones and a row of cedar beams. So were the inner court of the house of the LORD and the vestibule of the temple.","Sư pơm tăp dăr tơnăr hăm pêng trong tơmo gĭt, păng roh pêng trong tơpơng hăm tơ̆r 'long hơngo, sư pơm lei-lăi thoi lăm kơdeng, hăm gah cham Hnam akŭm Kră Yang."
"Now King Solomon sent and brought Huram from Tyre.","Pơtao Sôlômôn wơh bơngai năm krao wơ̆n Hiram đơ̆ng pơlei Tirơ."
"He was the son of a widow from the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a bronze worker; he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill in working with all kinds of bronze work. So he came to King Solomon and did all his work.","Hiram minh 'nu kon drŏ-nglo, mĕ sư bơngai drŏ-kăn adro đơ̆ng lăm adrĕch Neptali, 'bă sư sơ̆ đơ̆ng bơngai Tirơ, 'bă sư pơm bơ̆jang hling đak kong, Huram sư kư̆m minh 'nu bơngai gơh hơgei thoi 'bă sư sơ̆ bơ̆jang hling đak kong, sư năm truh tơ pơtao Sôlômôn, sư jang ăn kơ pơtao Sôlômôn."
"And he cast two pillars of bronze, each one eighteen cubits high, and a line of twelve cubits measured the circumference of each.","Huram sư hling pơm 'bar tŏ jrăng hăm kong, sư hling rim jrăng kơjung mơjĭt-tơhngam hơgăt dah iŏk tơlei pơtŏ sư, hơpôm sư đei mơjĭt-'bar hơgăt."
"Then he made two capitals of cast bronze, to set on the tops of the pillars. The height of one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits.","Sư tuh pơm kơ̆l 'bar tŏ jrăng hăm kong sư pơdơ̆ng kơpal jrăng, kơjung kơ̆l jrăng noh pơđăm hơgăt mă jrăng gah to pơđăm hơgăt mơ̆n."
"He made a lattice network, with wreaths of chainwork, for the capitals which were on top of the pillars: seven chains for one capital and seven for the other capital.","Sư kư̆m hling hơdrao hăm kong dan tơ rim kơ̆l jrăng; rim kơ̆l jrăng sư pơm tơpơh dăng tơlei rơbưn hăm kong tanh gơwŏk đơ̆ng hơdrao kơ̆l jrăng, rơbưn âu sư pơm nhen thoi pơkao."
"So he made the pillars, and two rows of pomegranates above the network all around to cover the capitals that were on top; and thus he did for the other capital.","Huram sư kư̆m hling 'bar trong plei gărnăt hăm kong chô̆ tơ hơdrao rim kơ̆l jrăng wă pơgong sư 'lơ̆ng hơbŏ."
"The capitals which were on top of the pillars in the hall were in the shape of lilies, four cubits.","Rim kơ̆l jrăng lăm kơdeng anăp sư hling thoi pơkao 'brê tih sư puăn hơgăt."
"The capitals on the two pillars also had pomegranates above, by the convex surface which was next to the network; and there were two hundred such pomegranates in rows on each of the capitals all around.","Rim 'nguaih kơ̆l jrăng 'noh sư hling minh trong; đei 'bar-hrĕng tŏ plei gărnăt, sư dăng tăp dăr kơ̆l jrăng 'noh."
"Then he set up the pillars by the vestibule of the temple; he set up the pillar on the right and called its name Jachin, and he set up the pillar on the left and called its name Boaz.","Huram sư pơtăm 'bar tŏ jrăng noh anăp Hnam akŭm Kră Yang, sư pơtăm minh pôm jrăng gah 'ma. Sư anăn jrăng 'noh Jakin; sư pơtăm jrăng gah 'ngiĕo 'noh sư anăn jrăng Bôas."
"The tops of the pillars were in the shape of lilies. So the work of the pillars was finished.","Tôch kơ̆l jrăng 'noh sư pơm rup pơkao tŏng-mŏng, đĭ dôm lu jrăng 'noh sư pơm keh bơih."
"And he made the Sea of cast bronze, ten cubits from one brim to the other; it was completely round. Its height was five cubits, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference.","Sư kư̆m pơm bơng đak hơpôm hling hăm kong să mơjĭt hơgăt; kơjung pơđăm hơgăt, đei pêng-jĭt hơgăt jum dăr."
"Below its brim were ornamental buds encircling it all around, ten to a cubit, all the way around the Sea. The ornamental buds were cast in two rows when it was cast.","Rok jih bơng đak 'noh sư tuh pơm rup get đak 'bar trong tăp dăr kơ bơng 'noh; kiơ̆ kơ lăm minh hơgăt mơjĭt tŏ get sư pơm kơtă hăm bơng đak 'noh"
"It stood on twelve oxen: three looking toward the north, three looking toward the west, three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; the Sea was set upon them, and all their back parts pointed inward.","Bơng đak 'nâu dan kơpal kơdŭ rŏng mơjĭt-'bar tŏ rơmo tơwih băl kiĕng, pêng tŏ tơ'bong sư tơwih gah hơlĕch, pêng tŏ tơ'bong sư tơwih gah bơmơ̆t, pêng tŏ tơ'bong sư tơwih gah gơal, pêng tŏ gah yă-nơ̆m."
"It was a handbreadth thick; and its brim was shaped like the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It contained two thousand baths.","'Bơ̆r bơng hơ'bơ̆l tŏ pah, gơnăp sư thoi gơnăp pơnhan đei thoi pơkao tŏng-mŏng, bơng 'nâu mong đei puăn-jĭt puăn-rơbâu lit đak."
"He also made ten carts of bronze; four cubits was the length of each cart, four cubits its width, and three cubits its height.","Sư kư̆m pơm mơjĭt tŏ gre hăm kong jơ̆ng đei tang-wang hăm kong, lăm minh pôm gre 'noh tor sư 'bar hlok, wơ̆l sư kư̆m 'bar hlok; kơjung sư minh hlok minh puăt."
"And this was the design of the carts: They had panels, and the panels were between frames","Sư pơm gre 'noh sư hling tơnăr hăm kong kơtă kơ akâu gre."
"on the panels that were between the frames were lions, oxen, and cherubim. And on the frames was a pedestal on top. Below the lions and oxen were wreaths of plaited work.","Rim tơnăr 'noh sư hling đei rup dăm-brang, rup rơmo păng rup chêrubim, sư pơm kơpal păng ala kơ rup dăm-brang, rup rơmo, păng rup chêrubim đei chhơ̆ rup pơkao ngăl."
"Every cart had four bronze wheels and axles of bronze, and its four feet had supports. Under the laver were supports of cast bronze beside each wreath.","Rim kơ gre 'noh sư pơm puăn tŏ jơ̆ng păng tơnung sư hăm kong, puăn pah mum 'noh sư pơm đei jơ̆ng sư wă kơ pơdơ̆ng kơjăp.

"Its opening inside the crown at the top was one cubit in diameter; and the opening was round, shaped like a pedestal, one and a half cubits in outside diameter; and also on the opening were engravings, but the panels were square, not round.","Kơpal hơnă gre đei hling gor pơm ala, gor 'nâu minh hơgăt hlom jrŭ tơ lăm tơpơh pơ̆t minh puăt, gah đaih tơnăr akâu sư hơli pơiel pơgong.

"Under the panels were the four wheels, and the axles of the wheels were joined to the cart. The height of a wheel was one and a half cubits.","Ala kơ rim hlak kong akâu sư noh đei puăn tŏ jơ̆ng gre, tơnung sư rim kơ jơ̆ng gre 'noh kơjung sư tơpơh pơ̆t minh puăt."
"The workmanship of the wheels was like the workmanship of a chariot wheel; their axle pins, their rims, their spokes, and their hubs were all of cast bronze.","Jơ̆ng sư 'noh pơm lei-lăi thoi jơ̆ng gre aseh tơpă, lu tơnung dăr gre, tă kơ tuh hling ngăl."
"And there were four supports at the four corners of each cart; its supports were part of the cart itself.","'Bơ̆t rim puăn pah mum, ala kơ puăn tŏ jrăng tơjră sư hling mam pơm tơklep hăm akâu gre."
"On the top of the cart, at the height of half a cubit, it was perfectly round. And on the top of the cart, its flanges and its panels were of the same casting.","'Bơ̆r kơpal gre sư đei gor hơpôm, kơjung sư minh puăt hơgăt, akâu gor păng jơ̆ng sư hling kơtă hăm kơpal 'bơ̆r gre."
"On the plates of its flanges and on its panels he engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, wherever there was a clear space on each, with wreaths all around.","Kơpal kơ mam blat gơnăp hơpôm kơpal lu tơmam blat akâu gre sư chhơ̆ lu rup chêrubim, dăm-brang, hla gol, anih ayơ oei rơhơi sư chhơ̆ trong pơkao tăp dăr."
"Thus he made the ten carts. All of them were of the same mold, one measure, and one shape.","Sư kư̆m pơm rok lei-lăi sư pơm đei mơjĭt tŏ gre thoi noh, sư hling ngăl đĭ lu gre."
"Then he made ten lavers of bronze; each laver contained forty baths, and each laver was four cubits. On each of the ten carts was a laver.","Sư pơm mơjĭt tŏ bơng đak, man hling hăm kong, lăm minh tŏ bơng đak 'noh sư mong tuh đei tơhngam-hrĕng tơhngam-jĭt lit đak, minh pôm bơng đak kơjung sư 'bar hlok, sư tah lu bơng đak noh tơ lăm mơjĭt tŏ gre, minh pôm gre minh pôm bơng đak noh."
"And he put five carts on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house. He set the Sea on the right side of the house, toward the southeast.","Sư dan pơđăm tŏ gre gah gơal pơđăm tŏ gre gah yă-nơ̆m kơ hnam akŭm.

"Huram made the lavers and the shovels and the bowls. So Huram finished doing all the work that he was to do for King Solomon for the house of the LORD","Sư kư̆m pơm gŏ glah chơ'mŏng păng kơthao.

"the two pillars, the two bowl-shaped capitals that were on top of the two pillars; the two networks covering the two bowl-shaped capitals which were on top of the pillars","Pơm 'bar tŏ jrăng hăm kong, pơm kơ̆l sư hơgơn kơpal kơ 'bar tŏ jrăng kong, lu hơdrao hăm kong klơ̆p lê̆ kơpal kơ̆l jrăng."

"the ten carts, and ten lavers on the carts","Đei mơjĭt tŏ gre, sư dan mơjĭt tŏ bơng đak kơpal lu gre noh."
"one Sea, and twelve oxen under the Sea","Sư pơm minh pôm bơng đak tih păng mơjĭt-'bar tŏ rơmo sư pơm man ala kơ bơng đak."
"the pots, the shovels, and the bowls. All these articles which Huram made for King Solomon for the house of the LORD were of burnished bronze.","Sư pơm lu gŏ glah, gơ'beng păng kơthao.

"In the plain of Jordan the king had them cast in clay molds, between Succoth and Zaretan.","Pơtao Sôlômôn athei Hiram man lu tơmam âu tơ anih thŭng (Jôrđăn) tơ lăm anih 'noh đei teh lơ̆n, anih 'noh sơlam Sukôt păng Sarethan."
"And Solomon did not weigh all the articles, because there were so many; the weight of the bronze was not determined.","Pơtao Sôlômôn sư ưh kơ đei kŏng lăng tơmam 'noh ôh, yua kơ tơmam lơ dêh, sư kư̆m ưh kơ đei kĕ hơlen kŏng lăng kong 'noh dôm yơ mơ̆n."
"Thus Solomon had all the furnishings made for the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold on which was the showbread","Pơtao Sôlômôn sư kư̆m pơm tơmam yua lăm Hnam akŭm Kră Yang sư pơm chơnang soi hăm maih; sư kư̆m pơm gơ'bang 'măn 'bĕng hăm maih."
"the lampstands of pure gold, five on the right side and five on the left in front of the inner sanctuary, with the flowers and the lamps and the wick-trimmers of gold","Jơ̆ng ŭnh kơđeng sư pơm hăm maih se, pơđăm tŏ sư 'măn gah 'ma, pơđăm tŏ gah 'ngiĕo, 'bơ̆t anăp anih rơgoh hloh, sư kư̆m ăn pơm lu pơkao, ŭnh kơđeng păng săng kep kăt păng maih."
"the basins, the trimmers, the bowls, the ladles, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner room (the Most Holy Place) and for the doors of the main hall of the temple.","Dôm lu pơnhan, săng, kăt brai ŭnh kơđeng, kơthao, grang tơmam mă mong tơnuh păng grang mong ngar sư pơm păng maih, dôm lu gơwŏk 'măng, sư pơm kơ lu 'măng lăm anih Rơgoh Hloh, hăm 'măng Hnam akŭm, sư kư̆m pơm hăm maih ngăl."
"So all the work that King Solomon had done for the house of the LORD was finished; and Solomon brought in the things which his father David had dedicated: the silver and the gold and the furnishings. He put them in the treasuries of the house of the LORD.","Đĭ-đăng dôm tơdrong jang pơtao Sôlômôn pơm Hnam akŭm Kră Yang pơm keh đĭ, đang kơ 'noh pơtao Sôlômôn wơh đe chĕp đĭ dôm tơmam 'bă sư Đawit pơyơ̆r sư 'măn lê̆ lăm hnam mong tơmam, lu hu, maih păng dôm tơmam yua nai dơ̆ng mơ̆n, tah lăm Hnam Kră Yang."
"Now Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel, to King Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the City of David, which is Zion.","Pơtao Sôlômôn, krao akŭm đĭ lu kră pơgơ̆r, lu yŏng kơdră lăm adrĕch adrung Isơrael năm tơ sư tơ Pơlei Jêrusalem năm sơng Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang đơ̆ng lăm pơlei Đawit tơ Siôn ba tơ Hnam akŭm Kră Yang."
"Therefore all the men of Israel assembled with King Solomon at the feast in the month of Ethanim, which is the seventh month.","Kơplah lu sư akŭm pơm phĕt, 'noh lăm khei tơpơh lu sư jô̆ khan khei Êthanim, đĭ-đăng lu bơngai Isơrael wang akŭm hơdai hăm pơtao Sôlômôn."
"So all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.","Kơplah lu kră pơlei Isơrael truh, lu 'bok soi tung hloi Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang."
"Then they brought up the ark of the LORD, the tabernacle of meeting, and all the holy furnishings that were in the tabernacle. The priests and the Levites brought them up.","Lu sư tung ba hloi hnam khăn anih akŭm. Hom Pơgơ̆p chĕp ba dôm tơmam rơgoh năm hloi tơ anih noh; lu 'bok soi păng bơngai Lêwi tung hom pơgơ̆p 'noh."
"Also King Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel who were assembled with him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted or numbered for multitude.","Pơtao Sôlômôn păng đĭ-đăng kon pơlei Isơrael minh pôm jơhngơ̆m đon akŭm hơdai, đĭ-đăng dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp Hom Pơgơ̆p; sư 'bet rơmo păng triu lơlap pơm tơmam soi pơyơ̆r, dĭng mah pă kĕ jô̆."
"Then the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place, into the inner sanctuary of the temple, to the Most Holy Place, under the wings of the cherubim.","Lu 'bok soi tơm tung ba Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang tơ anih sư, anih rơgoh hloh lu sư 'măn gah ala pơnăr chêrubim."
"For the cherubim spread their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim overshadowed the ark and its poles.","Dôm lu chêrubim bơyar pơnăr kơpal Hom Pơgơ̆p, sư klơ̆p lê̆ Hom Pơgơ̆p păng 'long tơnung tung."
"The poles extended so that the ends of the poles could be seen from the holy place, in front of the inner sanctuary; but they could not be seen from outside. And they are there to this day.","Dôm lu tơnung tung kơjung na đe lăng 'bôh đơ̆ng anih rơgoh mă truh tơ Anih Rơgoh Hloh, sư kư̆m oei 'bôh mơ̆n.

"Nothing was in the ark except the two tablets of stone which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.","Lăm Hom Pơgơ̆p 'noh đei 'bar hlak gơ'bang păng tơmo đơ̆ng Môis dan lê̆ đơ̆ng kông Hôrêp; iŏk đơ̆ng năr Kră Yang pơgơ̆p pơkă pơkăm hăm lu bơngai Isơrael kơplah lu sư 'nao lĕch đơ̆ng dêh char Êyiptơ."
"And it came to pass, when the priests came out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD","Kơplah lu 'bok soi lĕch đơ̆ng anih rơgoh đei hơmơ̆l gom 'bĕnh lăm Hnam Kră Yang."
"so that the priests could not continue ministering because of the cloud; for the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD.","Lu 'bok soi ưh kơ gơh dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anih noh wă jang, yua kơ tơdrong hơdah rang mơnhal păng hơmơ̆l 'bĕnh kơ Hnam akŭm Kră Yang."
"Then Solomon spoke: “The LORD said He would dwell in the dark cloud.","Kơplah noh pơtao Sôlômôn khan; “Kră Yang ih khan ih gô oei lăm hơmơ̆l măng mu."
"I have surely built You an exalted house, And a place for You to dwell in forever.”","Dang ei inh pơm Hnam akŭm 'lơ̆ng rŏ keh bơih; anih wă kơ Ih oei ling-lang.”"
"Then the king turned around and blessed the whole assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel was standing.","Đơ̆ng noh pơtao Sôlômôn sư tơwih muh măt tơ kon pơlei Isơrael, đĭ-đăng kon pơlei Isơrael oei dơ̆ng iung na sư krao khan hơpơi tuh ăn tơdrong pŭn hiôk."
"And he said: “Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who spoke with His mouth to my father David, and with His hand has fulfilled it, saying","Sư khan: “Bơnê ư-ang kơ Kră Yang; 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael pơkeh đơ̆ng Ih pơkă hăm 'bă inh Đawit, yua kơ đơ̆ng ti mơsêh Ih pơsĭt trŏ nơ̆r pơkă 'noh,” Ih kư̆m khan thoi âu dơ̆ng"
"‘Since the day that I brought My people Israel out of Egypt, I have chosen no city from any tribe of Israel in which to build a house, that My name might be there; but I chose David to be over My people Israel.’","‘Iŏk đơ̆ng năr Ih pơklaih lu bơngai Isơrael đơ̆ng dêh Êyiptơ, Inh ưh kơ đei rơih iŏk ôh khŭl bơngai bu đơ̆ng lăm bơngai Isơrael, pơjing pơm Hnam akŭm wă kơ anăn Inh oei lăm noh.

"Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a temple for the name of the LORD God of Israel.","“Lăm jơhngơ̆m 'bă inh Đawit sư kư̆m đei wă pơjing minh pôm Hnam akŭm ăn kơ anăn Kră Yang, 'Bok Kei-Dei lu bơngai Isơrael."
"But the LORD said to my father David, ‘Whereas it was in your heart to build a temple for My name, you did well that it was in your heart.","Mă-lei Kră Yang khan kơ 'bă inh Đawit: “Yua kơ ih tơchĕng wă pơm hnam akŭm kơ anăn Inh ih đei jơhngơ̆m 'lơ̆ng dêh."

"So the LORD has fulfilled His word which He spoke; and I have filled the position of my father David, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised; and I have built a temple for the name of the LORD God of Israel.","“Dang ei Kră Yang, pơsĭt bơih kơ đêl nơ̆r Sư pơkă.

"On the same day the king consecrated the middle of the court that was in front of the house of the LORD; for there he offered burnt offerings, grain offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar that was before the LORD was too small to receive the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.","Lăm năr 'noh pơtao Sôlômôn sư klah sư 'măn lê̆ minh anih tŏk-bŏk cham 'bơ̆t anăp, Hnam akŭm Kră Yang; tơ anih 'noh sư wă pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'buh, tơmam soi pơyơ̆r phe 'ba, păng tơmam soi rơmă tơmam soi 'blŏk bơnê, yua chơnang pơm hăm kong noh iĕ, ưh kơ mah wă dan đĭ dôm lu tơmam soi 'buh, tơmam soi pơyơ̆r phe 'ba, lu rơmă tơmam soi 'blŏk bơnê."

"Now if you walk before Me as your father David walked, in integrity of heart and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded you, and if you keep My statutes and My judgments","“Gah ih, tơdah ih yak kiơ̆ trong Inh kư̆m thoi Đawit, 'bă ih yak năm bơih hăm jơhngơ̆m đon rơgoh 'lơ̆ng tơpăt pơm kiơ̆ dôm nơ̆r Inh athei ih, wei răk dôm nơ̆r Inh pơkă tơtă khan kơ ih"

"But if you or your sons at all turn from following Me, and do not keep My commandments and My statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods and worship them","Mă-lei tơdah ih păng lu kon sâu ih weh tơklah đơ̆ng Inh ưh kơ wă wei răk khôi juăt păng dôm nơ̆r Inh tơtă ăn kơ lu iĕm, na bơ̆jang păng kơkuh kơ rup yang nai"
"then I will cut off Israel from the land which I have given them; and this house which I have consecrated for My name I will cast out of My sight.

"Then they will answer, ‘Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have embraced other gods, and worshiped them and served them; therefore the LORD has brought all this calamity on them.’ ”","Đe gô khan: 'Noh yua kơ lu sư weh tơklah đơ̆ng Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu sư, Tơ'ngla tơlĕch lu yă 'bok sư đơ̆ng char Êyiptơ, lu sư kiơ̆ yang nai, bơ̆jang păng kơkuh kơ yang 'noh, yua kơ thoi 'noh bơih na Kră Yang ăn kơ lu sư tơdrong truh răm thoi âu.”"

"(Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and taken Gezer and burned it with fire, had killed the Canaanites who dwelt in the city, and had given it as a dowry to his daughter, Solomon’s wife.)","Pharaôn, pơtao char Êyiptơ tŏk tơgar blah iŏk pơlei Geser soh pơđĭ pơlei 'noh păng pơlôch đĭ kon bơngai Kanaan 'noh, đơ̆ng noh sư ăn kơ kon drŏ-kăn sư pơlei 'noh jing tơmam sư kơdih, kon drŏ-kăn sư 'noh akăn pơtao Sôlômôn."
"And Solomon built Gezer, Lower Beth Horon","Thoi noh, pơtao Sôlômôn tơiung pơjing ming pơlei Geser dơ̆ng, păng pơlei Bêt Hôrôn gah ala."
"Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land of Judah","Pơlei Balat păng pơlei Tamar tơ lăm char 'blach Juđa."
"all the storage cities that Solomon had, cities for his chariots and cities for his cavalry, and whatever Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.","Sôlômôn kư̆m đei pơm pơlei 'măn dôm tơmam, 'măn gre aseh, pơlei ăn kơ lu linh hao aseh oei păng dôm tơdrong Sôlômôn wă pơm lăm pơlei Jêrusalem, lăm char Liban păng đĭ-đăng lăm char sư pơgơ̆r."
"All the people who were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel","Đĭ-đăng lu bơngai mă oei arih đơ̆ng lu bơngai Amôrit, bơngai Hêtit bơngai Phêrisit, bơngai Hêwit păng lu bơngai Jêbus, lu sư ưh kơ trŏ kơ bơngai Isơrael ôh."
"that is, their descendants who were left in the land after them, whom the children of Israel had not been able to destroy completely—from these Solomon raised forced labor, as it is to this day.","Dôm lu kon sâu sư mă oei arih lăm dêh char mă lu bơngai Isơrael ưh kơ kĕ pơlôch pơđĭ 'noh, na Sôlômôn rôp lu sư pơm đĭch bơ̆jang truh tơ dang ei."
"But of the children of Israel Solomon made no forced laborers, because they were men of war and his servants: his officers, his captains, commanders of his chariots, and his cavalry.","Mă-lei gah lu bơngai Isơrael, Sôlômôn ưh kơ rôp lu sư pơm đĭch ôh, lu sư pơm linh tơblah, mơ'nah pơm 'bok pơgơ̆r linh, mơ'nah pơm 'bok pơgơ̆r lu yŏng linh, mơ'nah wei-lăng lu bơngai hao gre aseh păng lu bơngai hao aseh."
"Others were chiefs of the officials who were over Solomon’s work: five hundred and fifty, who ruled over the people who did the work.","'Nâu lu 'bok yŏng wei-lăng tơdrong jang mă Sôlômôn pơjao; lu sư đei pơđăm-hrĕng pơđăm-jĭt 'nu wei-lăng kon pơlei bơ̆jang pơm Hnam akŭm păng pơm hnam pơtao."
"But Pharaoh’s daughter came up from the City of David to her house which Solomon had built for her. Then he built the Millo.","Lăp kon drŏ-kăn pơtao Pharaôn năm đơ̆ng pơlei Đawit năm tơ hnam pơtao sư kơdih, mă hnam Sôlômôn pơm ăn kơ sư; pơtao kư̆m pơm dur wă găn lu ayăt."
"Now three times a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he had built for the LORD, and he burned incense with them on the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished the temple.","Pêng wơ̆t lăm minh sơnăm Sôlômôn juăt kơ pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'buh păng tơmam pơyơ̆r apinh tơdrong hiôk-hian tơ kơpal chơnang soi mă sư đei pơm ăn kơ Kră Yang păng soh tơmam 'bâu phu hai 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang.

"King Solomon also built a fleet of ships at Ezion Geber, which is near Elath on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.","Pơtao Sôlômôn kư̆m pơm lơlap duk thŏng-nan tơ pơlei Êsiôn Gêber oei jê̆ pơlei Êlat tơ đak Dơsĭ 'Brê lăm dêh char Eđôm."
"Then Hiram sent his servants with the fleet, seamen who knew the sea, to work with the servants of Solomon.","Đơ̆ng noh Hiram wơh đĭch đam sư, wă khan lu bơngai hơgei huơ̆r thŏng-nan lăm đak dơsĭ năm tơgŭm hơdai lu đĭch đam Sôlômôn."
"And they went to Ophir, and acquired four hundred and twenty talents of gold from there, and brought it to King Solomon.","Lu sư năm tơ dêh char Ôphir, lu sư chă chĕp ba puăn-hrĕng 'bar-jĭt talâng maihb đơ̆ng dêh char 'noh năm ăn kơ pơtao Sôlômôn."
"Now when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to test him with hard questions.","Wă yă pơtao dêh char Sêba kơtơ̆ng đe ư-ang kơ pơtao Sôlômôn đơ̆ng anăn Kră Yang, sư năm tơ noh wă pơlong lăng tơdrong hơgei Sôlômôn hăm tơdrong pơpơn tơnat."
"She came to Jerusalem with a very great retinue, with camels that bore spices, very much gold, and precious stones; and when she came to Solomon, she spoke with him about all that was in her heart.","Yă pơtao sư truh tơ pơlei Jêrusalem hơdai hăm lơ bơngai lơ aseh lăk-đa chơ pơgang 'bâu phu, đei maih lơ păng lu tơmo gĭt kư̆m lơ.

"So Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing so difficult for the king that he could not explain it to her.","Sôlômôn tơl tơwih dôm nơ̆r sư jet 'noh. Ưh kơ đei nơ̆r jet ayơ hlơp mă Sôlômôn ưh kơ băt tơl tơwih ăn kơ sư."
"And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built","Lăp yă pơtao dêh char Sêba 'bôh dôm tơdrong gơh hơgei Sôlômôn păng hnam pơtao sư đei pơm"
"the food on his table, the seating of his servants, the service of his waiters and their apparel, his cupbearers, and his entryway by which he went up to the house of the LORD, there was no more spirit in her.","tơmam sŏng sa kơpal gơ'bang, tang-dŏ lu bơngai jang sư hơ-oei, tơdrong jang lu đĭch đam sư, hơbĕn ao lu sư hrŭk, lu bơngai năm ba kơchŏk đak nhă pơtao păng dôm tơmam soi pơyơ̆r lăm Hnam kơkuh kơ Kră Yang, yă pơtao ưh pă gơh pơma kiơ."
"Then she said to the king: “It was a true report which I heard in my own land about your words and your wisdom.","Sư khan kơ pơtao Sôlômôn: “Dôm tơdrong inh kơtơ̆ng đe roi lăm char inh gah nơ̆r pơma păng tơdrong gơh hơgei ih trŏ tơpă bơih."
"However I did not believe the words until I came and saw with my own eyes; and indeed the half was not told me. Your wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame of which I heard.","Kơplah inh tam mă truh tơ âu păng măt inh ưh tam mă 'bôh inh ưh kơ lui ôh dôm tơdrong mă đe roi 'noh; tơdrong mă inh kơtơ̆ng lăp minh puăt tơdrong gơh hơgei păng tơdrong mơdrŏng ih oei hloh kơ dôm tơdrong inh kơtơ̆ng."
"Happy are your men and happy are these your servants, who stand continually before you and hear your wisdom!","Pŭn hiôk tih tơpă kơ lu đĭch đam ih bơngai mă oei hơdai ih! Lu bơngai mă oei awih awăn 'bơ̆t anăp ih ling-lang păng kơtơ̆ng dôm tơdrong gơh hơgei ih."
"Blessed be the LORD your God, who delighted in you, setting you on the throne of Israel! Because the LORD has loved Israel forever, therefore He made you king, to do justice and righteousness.”","Kơkuh bơnê kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ih, yua kơ Sư lăp đon kơ ih ăn kơ ih hơ-oei kơpal tang-dŏ pơtao lu bơngai Isơrael!

"Then she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, spices in great quantity, and precious stones. There never again came such abundance of spices as the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.","Yă pơtao ăn kơ pơtao Sôlômôn minh-hrĕng 'bar-jĭt talâng (kĭ) maih, ăn lơ 'long pơgang 'bâu phu păng lu tơmo gĭt.

"Also, the ships of Hiram, which brought gold from Ophir, brought great quantities of almug wood and precious stones from Ophir.","Kŭm đei duk Hiram chơ ba maih đơ̆ng dêh char Ôphir, sư kư̆m chơ ba 'long kơte păng tơmo gĭt lơlap."
"And the king made steps of the almug wood for the house of the LORD and for the king’s house, also harps and stringed instruments for singers. There never again came such almug wood, nor has the like been seen to this day.","Pơtao yua 'long kơte pơm jrăng tơm Hnam Kră Yang păng hnam pơtao, păng lu brŏ dung, tĭng-nĭng ăn kơ lu bơngai hơri.

"Now King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired, whatever she asked, besides what Solomon had given her according to the royal generosity. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.","Pơtao Sôlômôn ăn kơ yă pơtao dêh Sêba dôm tơmam kiơ sư wă, dôm tơmam sư apinh, ưh kơ jô̆ dôm tơmam mă pơtao Sôlômôn juăt ăn kơ sư adrol.

"The weight of gold that came to Solomon yearly was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold","Lăm rim sơnăm Sôlômôn sư ra maih đei 'bar-jĭt 'bar-rơbâu pơđăm-hrĕng kĭ."
"besides that from the traveling merchants, from the income of traders, from all the kings of Arabia, and from the governors of the country.","Ưh kơ jô̆ maih iŏk đơ̆ng lu bơngai mơdro păng đơ̆ng lu anih tĕch mơdro hăm lu teh đak 'nguaih, đơ̆ng đĭ lu pơtao dêh Arơ̆p păng đơ̆ng lu yŏng pơgơ̆r tơ rim char chĕp ba ăn kơ sư."
"And King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred shekels of gold went into each shield.","Pơtao Sôlômôn pơm 'bar-hrĕng tŏ khêl tih păng maih hling hơtăng. Lăm rim kơ minh hlak khêl noh yua dang puăn kĭ maih."
"He also made three hundred shields of hammered gold; three minas of gold went into each shield. The king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.","Pơtao kư̆m pơm pêng-hrĕng hlak khêl iĕ păng maih hling hơtăng, lăm rim kơ minh hlak khêl noh yua dang tơ 'bar kĭ.

"Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.","Pơtao kư̆m đei pơm minh pôm tang-dŏ tih hăm bơla rôih, bah maih se."
"The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round at the back; there were armrests on either side of the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the armrests.","Tang-dŏ 'nâu đei tơdrâu kơnao, mă kơjung hloh 'bơ̆t gơning rŏng sư wĭl đei pơm hơgơn ti 'bar pah tang-dŏ păng 'bơ̆t cheng hơgơn ti đei 'bar tŏ rup dăm-brang."
"Twelve lions stood there, one on each side of the six steps; nothing like this had been made for any other kingdom.","Kŭm đei mơjĭt-'bar to rup dăm-brang nai dơ̆ng, 'bơ̆t rim kơ̆l tơdrâu kơ 'nao: Ưh tam đei dêh char ayơ mă pơm tang-dŏ pơtao thoi noh."
"All King Solomon’s drinking vessels were gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Not one was silver, for this was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon.","Đĭ-đăng kơchŏk pơnhan wă nhă tă kơ pơm hăm maih ngăl păng đĭ-đăng dôm tơmam yua lăm hnam pơtao tơ Bri char Liban tă kơ pơm păng maih rơgoh, ưh kơ đei tơmam kiơ pơm păng hu.

"For the king had merchant ships at sea with the fleet of Hiram. Once every three years the merchant ships came bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and monkeys.","Yua kơ pơtao đei lơ duk đơ̆ng Tarsis lăm đak dơsĭ hơdai hăm duk Hiram, lăm pêng sơnăm minh 'măng brŏk chơ ba maih, hu, bơla rôih, kuĕnh păng hơmră."
"So King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.","Pơtao Sôlômôn bơih mơdrŏng păng gơh hơgei đe ư-ang hloh kơ đĭ-đăng pơtao lăm teh đak 'nâu."
"Now all the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.","Đĭ-đăng kon bơngai lăm teh đak 'nâu chă wă 'maih tơ'bơ̆p Sôlômôn, wă mơ̆ng tơdrong gơh hơgei đơ̆ng Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ăn kơ sư."
"Each man brought his present: articles of silver and gold, garments, armor, spices, horses, and mules, at a set rate year by year.","Rim sơnăm, bu năm kư̆m chĕp ba tơmam pơyơ̆r ăn kơ pơtao, mơ'nah pơm păng hu mơ'nah pơm păng maih, hơbĕn ao, đao hơlă, đak pơgang 'bâu phu, aseh, aseh iĕ."
"And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen; he had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king at Jerusalem.","Pơtao Sôlômôn akŭm pơđĭ gre aseh păng aseh, minh-rơbâu puăn-hrĕng gre aseh păng mơjĭt-'bar rơbâu aseh. Sư 'măn gre aseh lăm lu pơlei lu linh đei lu gre aseh jê̆ pơtao tơ Pơlei Jêrusalem."
"The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedar trees as abundant as the sycamores which are in the lowland.","Pơtao Sôlômôn pơm kơ hu đe lăng ưh kơ gĭt thoi tơmo hmă đĕch lăm pơlei Jêrusalem păng 'long hơngo lơ thoi 'long hơra chăt tơ jơ̆ng kông groi."
"Also Solomon had horses imported from Egypt and Keveh; the king’s merchants bought them in Keveh at the current price.","Pơtao Sôlômôn chă aseh đơ̆ng dêh char Êyiptơ păng char Kue; lu bơngai mă pơtao Sôlômôn yua wă mơdro ăn kơ sư năm tơ char Kue chă răt lu sư răt huay kơ kăp dêh."
"Now a chariot that was imported from Egypt cost six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse one hundred and fifty; and thus, through their agents, they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria.","Đe răt minh pôm gre aseh đơ̆ng char Êyiptơ dang tơpơh kĭ hu, minh pôm aseh đe răt dang minh kĭ tơpơh lang hu.

"But King Solomon loved many foreign women, as well as the daughter of Pharaoh: women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites","'Nguaih kơ kon hơdruh Pharaôn, pơtao Sôlômôn hưch kơ lơ adruh bơngai tơmoi nai. Noh lu drŏ-kăn bơngai Môap, Ammôn, Eđôm, Siđôn păng Hêlit."
"from the nations of whom the LORD had said to the children of Israel, “You shall not intermarry with them, nor they with you. Surely they will turn away your hearts after their gods.” Solomon clung to these in love.","Lu adrĕch adrung bơngai noh. Kră Yang khan bơih kơ lu bơngai Isơrael: Iĕm ưh kơ gơh iŏk klo dah iŏk akăn đơ̆ng adrĕch adrung bơngai 'noh; yua kơ lu sư gô pơhlŭ pơlung lu iĕm kiơ̆ kơkuh kơ rup yang lu sư.

"And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart.","Sư đei tơpơh-hrĕng akăn oei kơ kon adruh pơtao păng đei pêng-hrĕng akăn kơnhŏng, lu sư pơhlŭ pơlung jơhngơ̆m đon Sôlômôn weh đơ̆ng Kră Yang."
"For it was so, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned his heart after other gods; and his heart was not loyal to the LORD his God, as was the heart of his father David.","Truh tơ Sôlômôn kră pă kĕ lu akăn sư pơhlŭ pơlung sư kiơ̆ yang lu sư; jơhngơ̆m sư ưh pă chu yom kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei thoi jơhngơ̆m đon Đawit 'bă sư."
"For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.","Yua kơ Sôlômôn kơkuh kơ Astoret yang drŏ-kăn yang lu bơngai Siđôn păng chu kiơ̆ kơ Milkôm yang lu bơngai Ammôn yang kơnê̆ dêh."
"Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and did not fully follow the LORD, as did his father David.","Thoi noh Sôlômôn pơm tơdrong yoch kơnê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang păng sư ưh kơ wă chu kiơ̆ Kră Yang hăm đĭ jơhngơ̆m klơm klak thoi Đawit 'bă sư chu yom bơih."
"Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, on the hill that is east of Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the people of Ammon.","Kơpal groi gah hơlĕch kơ pơlei Jêrusalem Sôlômôn man minh pôm hnam kơ Kêmôs yang lu bơngai Môap păng kơ yang Môlek yang lu bơngai Ammôn."
"And he did likewise for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and sacrificed to their gods.","Sư pơm ăn kơ đĭ lu akăn sư bơngai tơmoi thoi noh, na đĭ-đăng lu sư soh tơmam 'bâu phu păng soi kơkuh kơ yang lu sư."
"So the LORD became angry with Solomon, because his heart had turned from the LORD God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice","Kră Yang hil dêh kơ Sôlômôn, yua kơ jơhngơ̆m đon sư weh tơklah đơ̆ng Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael, Tơ'ngla mă đei tơ'bôh ăn kơ sư akâu 'bar 'măng bơih."
"and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods; but he did not keep what the LORD had commanded.","Khan kơ sư bơih ih 'nĕ kơ kiơ̆ lu yang nai; mă-lei sư ưh kơ chu kiơ̆ nơ̆r Kră Yang tơtă."
"Therefore the LORD said to Solomon, “Because you have done this, and have not kept My covenant and My statutes, which I have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom away from you and give it to your servant.","Na Kră Yang khan kơ Sôlômôn: “Yua kơ ih pơm tơdrong 'nâu, ih ưh kơ wei răk tơdrong Inh pơgơ̆p păng tơdrong juăt Inh tơtă kơ ih, na Inh gô hek lê̆ teh đak mă ih pơgơ̆r 'nâu, asong ăn kơ đĭch đam ih."
"Nevertheless I will not do it in your days, for the sake of your father David; I will tear it out of the hand of your son.","Mă-lei yua kơ Đawit 'bă ih, na Inh ưh kơ pơm ôh tơdrong 'nâu kơplah chăl ih dang ei, Inh gô hek teh đak 'nâu đơ̆ng tơpang ti kon drŏ-nglo ih."
"However I will not tear away the whole kingdom; I will give one tribe to your son for the sake of My servant David, and for the sake of Jerusalem which I have chosen.”","Mă-lei Inh ưh kơ hek asong pơđĭ hloi ôh; mă-lei Inh gô 'măn lê̆ minh adrĕch adrung ăn kơ sư yua kơ Đawit đĭch đam Inh păng yua kơ pơlei Jêrusalem, pơlei mă Inh đei rơih.”"
"Now the LORD raised up an adversary against Solomon, Hadad the Edomite; he was a descendant of the king in Edom.","Kră Yang atŏk minh 'nu bơngai ayăt tơblah hăm Sôlômôn, 'noh Hađat bơngai Eđôm; sư bơngai adrĕch adrung pơtao Eđôm."
"For it happened, when David was in Edom, and Joab the commander of the army had gone up to bury the slain, after he had killed every male in Edom","Kơplah Đawit 'nao oei lăm Eđôm na Jôap yŏng linh tŏk năm 'bŭ lu bơngai lôch, đei pơlôch pơđĭ lu bơngai drŏ-nglo lăm char Eđôm."
"(because for six months Joab remained there with all Israel, until he had cut down every male in Edom)","Jôap păng bơngai Isơrael oei tơ noh tơdrâu khei, dĭng mă lu sư pơlôch pơđĭ lu bơngai drŏ-nglo lăm char Eđôm."
"that Hadad fled to go to Egypt, he and certain Edomites of his father’s servants with him. Hadad was still a little child.","Mă-lei, Hađat hơdai hăm lu bơngai Eđôm đĭch đam 'bă sư kơdâu klĕnh tơ char Êyiptơ kơplah 'noh Hađat oei 'lơ̆p."
"Then they arose from Midian and came to Paran; and they took men with them from Paran and came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, apportioned food for him, and gave him land.","Lu sư lĕch đơ̆ng char Midian năm tơ char Paran; lu sư rôp chông ba bơngai Paran năm tơ char Êyiptơ tơ'bơ̆p pơtao Pharaôn. Pơtao Pharaôn ăn kơ sư hnam oei, tơmam sa păng mir chŭn."
"And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife, that is, the sister of Queen Tahpenes.","Pơtao Pharaôn mơnat kơ Hađat tih dêh, na sư ăn kơ Hađat oei kơ oh akăn sư, wă khan oh yă Tahpênes akăn pơtao Pharaôn."
"Then the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house. And Genubath was in Pharaoh’s household among the sons of Pharaoh.","Oh yă Tahpênes tơpŭ ăn kơ sư kon drŏ-nglo anăn sư Gênubat, dĭng Gênubat ưh pă mŏm bơih na Tahpênes iŏk rong sư tơ lăm hnam pơtao. Tơ noh Gênubat wơ̆ 'lŏ oei hơdai hăm lu kon pơtao Pharaôn."
"So when Hadad heard in Egypt that David rested with his fathers, and that Joab the commander of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, “Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.”","Kơplah Hađat oei tơ dêh Êyiptơ kơtơ̆ng ang Đawit lôch năm oei hơdai hăm lu 'bok kơdră sư, păng Jôap yŏng linh kư̆m đĭ lôch bơih, na sư khan kơ pơtao Pharaôn: Apinh ih ăn kơ inh brŏk tơ dêh char inh kơdih"
"Then Pharaoh said to him, “But what have you lacked with me, that suddenly you seek to go to your own country?” So he answered, “Nothing, but do let me go anyway.”","“Mă-lei Pharaôn tơl sư: Ih oei hơdai inh tơ âu hăm đei kơ'bah tơdrong kiơ na ih 'maih brŏk tơ dêh char ih kơdih? Na sư tơl: “Huay kơ'bah tơdrong kiơ ră.” Mă-lei apinh ih ăn kơ inh brŏk tơ dêh char inh kơdih."
"And God raised up another adversary against him, Rezon the son of Eliadah, who had fled from his lord, Hadadezer king of Zobah.","Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ăn minh 'nu ayăt hăm sư, bơngai nai dơ̆ng anăn sư Rêson kon drŏ-nglo Êliađa, kơdâu klĕnh đơ̆ng yŏng sư Hadadêser pơtao char Sôba."
"So he gathered men to him and became captain over a band of raiders, when David killed those of Zobah. And they went to Damascus and dwelt there, and reigned in Damascus.","Kơplah Đawit pơlôch linh pơtao Sôba, na Rêson krao akŭm lơ bơngai kiơ̆ sư, na sư pơm yŏng pơgơ̆r lu linh tơklah 'noh, năm truh tơ pơlei Đamas oei tơ noh na pôk sư kơdih pơm pơtao plei Đamas."
"He was an adversary of Israel all the days of Solomon (besides the trouble that Hadad caused); and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.","Rêson minh 'nu bơngai ayăt hăm lu bơngai Isơrael truh đĭ chăl pơtao Sôlômôn pơgơ̆r păng pơm dôm tơdrong kơnê̆ thoi Hađat đei pơm; sư pơgơ̆r dêh char Aram păng sư blah bơngai Isơrael."
"Then Solomon’s servant, Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite from Zereda, whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow, also rebelled against the king.","Jêrôbôam kon drŏ-nglo Nêbat, bơngai Êphraim oei tơ pơlei Sêrêđa, sư đĭch đam Sôlômôn; mĕ sư adro, anăn Sêrua; sư wă iung blah pơtao Sôlômôn mơ̆n."
"And this is what caused him to rebel against the king: Solomon had built the Millo and repaired the damages to the City of David his father.","'Nâu tơdrong yua kơ kiơ mă sư iung blah pơtao: Sôlômôn man tơiung dur găn păng hơmet ming dur mă hlôh pơchah lăm pơlei Đawit 'bă sư."
"The man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor; and Solomon, seeing that the young man was industrious, made him the officer over all the labor force of the house of Joseph.","Jêrôbôam sư minh 'nu bơngai pran hơgei; Sôlômôn 'bôh minh 'nu bơngai tơdăm pơnam hơgei bơ̆jang, na Sôlômôn ăn kơ sư pơm yŏng pơgơ̆r lu bơngai jang apah lăm adrĕch Jôsep."
"Now it happened at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite met him on the way; and he had clothed himself with a new garment, and the two were alone in the field.","Kơplah 'noh Jêrôbôam lĕch đơ̆ng pơlei Jêrusalem rok trong, Ahija bơngai khan lê̆ adrol pơlei Silô tơ'bơ̆p sư, Ahija hrŭk minh blah ao tai 'nao, 'bar 'nu măr sư đĕch oei tơ 'noh."
"Then Ahijah took hold of the new garment that was on him, and tore it into twelve pieces.","Ahija iŏk ao tai 'nao mă sư oei hrŭk 'noh hek pơm mơjĭt-'bar hlak."
"And he said to Jeroboam, “Take for yourself ten pieces, for thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: ‘Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and will give ten tribes to you","Đơ̆ng noh sư khan kơ Jêrôbôam: “Iŏk bĕ kơ ih mơjĭt hlak, Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael đei khan: 'Nâu, Inh gô iŏk hek lê̆ dêh char 'nâu đơ̆ng ti Sôlômôn, gô ăn kơ ih mơjĭt adrĕch adrung."
"(but he shall have one tribe for the sake of My servant David, and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel)","Mă-lei yua kơ Đawit đĭch đam Inh păng Jêrusalem pơlei mă Inh rơih iŏk boih, đơ̆ng rim adrĕch adrung Isơrael Inh gô lê̆ kơ sư minh adrĕch."
"because they have forsaken Me, and worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the people of Ammon, and have not walked in My ways to do what is right in My eyes and keep My statutes and My judgments, as did his father David.","Inh pơm thoi noh yua kơ sư achăng lê̆ Inh năm kơkuh kơ Astoret yang drŏ-kăn lu bơngai Siđôn, Kêmôs yang lu bơngai Môap, Milkôm yang lu bơngai Ammôn, sư ưh pă năm kiơ̆ trong Inh, ưh pă pơm 'lơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp Inh, păng kư̆m ưh kơ wă răk tơdrong juăt Inh păng nơ̆r Inh tơtă thoi Đawit, 'bă sư đei pơm."
"However I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, because I have made him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of My servant David, whom I chose because he kept My commandments and My statutes.","“Mă-lei ră Inh ưh kơ iŏk đĭ ôh teh đak đơ̆ng tơpang ti Sôlômôn, lê̆ kơ sư oei pơgơ̆r đĭ chăl arih sư, yua kơ Đawit đĭch đam Inh, Inh rơih iŏk boih, sư boih wei răk nơ̆r Inh tơtă păng pơm kiơ̆ dôm tơdrong juăt Inh."
"But I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand and give it to you—ten tribes.","Mă-lei inh gô iŏk teh đak đơ̆ng kon drŏ-nglo sư, na ăn kơ ih pơgơ̆r mơjĭt adrĕch adrung."
"And to his son I will give one tribe, that My servant David may always have a lamp before Me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen for Myself, to put My name there.","Inh gô ăn minh adrĕch adrung kơ kon drŏ-nglo sư wă kơ Đawit đĭch đam Inh oei đei minh pôm ŭnh kơđeng ling-lang 'bơ̆t anăp Inh, lăm pơlei Jêrusalem, pơlei mă Inh rơih iŏk wă 'măn Anăn Inh lăm noh."
"So I will take you, and you shall reign over all your heart desires, and you shall be king over Israel.","Inh rơih iŏk ih, ăn kơ ih pơm pơtao pơgơ̆r lu bơngai Isơrael, ih gô pơgơ̆r đĭ-đăng kiơ̆ kơ jơhngơ̆m ih wă."
"Then it shall be, if you heed all that I command you, walk in My ways, and do what is right in My sight, to keep My statutes and My commandments, as My servant David did, then I will be with you and build for you an enduring house, as I built for David, and will give Israel to you.","Tơdah ih chu kiơ̆ nơ̆r Inh pơkă, năm lăm trong Inh, pơm 'lơ̆ng tơpăt 'bơ̆t anăp Inh, hăm wei răk khôi juăt Inh păng nơ̆r Inh tơtă thoi Đawit đĭch đam Inh đei pơm, lei Inh gô oei hơdai ih.

"And I will afflict the descendants of David because of this, but not forever.’ ”","Thoi ei na inh gô phak lu adrĕch adrung Đawit mă-lei ưh kơ ling-lang ôh.”"
"Solomon therefore sought to kill Jeroboam. But Jeroboam arose and fled to Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.","Băt thoi noh Sôlômôn chă hloi wă pơlôch Jêrôbôam mă-lei Jêrôbôam iung hăt hot kơdâu ôn tơ dêh Êyiptơ, năm tơ Sisak pơtao Êyiptơ; păng oei hloi tơ pơtao Êyiptơ dĭng truh tơ Sôlômôn lôch."
"Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?","Dôm tơdrong jang nai Sôlômôn pơm, đĭ-đăng tơdrong kiơ pơtao Sôlômôn pơm păng tơdrong gơh hơgei pơtao đe đei chih răk bơih lăm sơ̆p hla bơar hơ'mon Sôlômôn?"
"And the period that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.","Sôlômôn pơgơ̆r oei tơ pơlei Jêrusalem, pơgơ̆r đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael lăm puăn-jĭt sơnăm."
"Then Solomon rested with his fathers, and was buried in the City of David his father. And Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.","Đơ̆ng noh sư lôch sư năm oei hơdai hăm lu 'bok kơdră sư păng đe 'bŭ sư lăm pơlei Đawit, 'bă sư, Rôbôam kon drŏ-nglo sư pơgơ̆r pơtrơp sư."
"And Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had gone to Shechem to make him king.","Rôbôam năm tơ pơlei Sichem, yua kơ đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael năm akŭm tơ noh bơih wă pôk sư pơm pơtao."
"So it happened, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard it (he was still in Egypt, for he had fled from the presence of King Solomon and had been dwelling in Egypt )","Jêrôbôam kon drŏ-nglo Nêbat, kơtơ̆ng tơdrong noh kơplah sư oei tơ dêh Êyiptơ anih sư kơdâu ôn kơ pơtao Sôlômôn, sư wih brŏk đơ̆ng dêh Êyiptơ."
"that they sent and called him. Then Jeroboam and the whole assembly of Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying","Đe athei bơngai năm krao sư đơ̆ng noh, na Jêrôbôam păng đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael năm tơ Rôbôam păng khan kơ sư"
"“Your father made our yoke heavy; now therefore, lighten the burdensome service of your father, and his heavy yoke which he put on us, and we will serve you.”","“'Bă ih tơ'băk ăn kơ nhôn 'long ăt trăp dêh, mă-lei dang ei apinh ih ăn kơ nhôn hơiơch 'biơ̆ dôm tơdrong jang gleh trăp păng 'long ăt trăp mă 'bă ih tơ'băk ăn kơ nhôn, na nhôn gô bơ̆jang kơ ih.”"
"So he said to them, “Depart for three days, then come back to me.” And the people departed.","Na Rôbôam tơl: “Iĕm brŏk bĕ, kơtĕch pêng năr iĕm năm tơ âu dơ̆ng.” Na lu kon pơlei wih brŏk."
"Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who stood before his father Solomon while he still lived, and he said, “How do you advise me to answer these people?”","Thoi noh Pơtao Rôbôam pơđâu hăm lu đe kră mă đêl bơ̆jang kơ Sôlômôn 'bă sư, kơplah 'bă sư oei arih: Sư jet: Lu iĕm pơđâu liơ, wă kơ inh tơl tơwih ăn kơ kon pơlei pơla 'nâu?"
"And they spoke to him, saying, “If you will be a servant to these people today, and serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.”","Lu sư tơl: “Tơdah năr 'nâu ih pơm thoi đĭch đam kon pơlei pơla, awih awăn kơ lu sư, tơl tơwih pơma dơnuh pơ'lơ̆ng hăm lu sư, lei lu sư gô pơm đĭch đam ih ling-lang.”"
"But he rejected the advice which the elders had given him, and consulted the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him.","Mă-lei Rôbôam sơngah ưh kơ kiơ̆ ôh nơ̆r lu kră 'noh roi kơ sư; đơ̆ng noh sư jet lu bơngai iung tơdăm hơdai sư, oei awih awăn kơ sư."
"And he said to them, “What advice do you give? How should we answer this people who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Lighten the yoke which your father put on us’?”","Pơtao jet: “Lu iĕm roi lăng kơ inh wă tơl tơwih kơ kon pơlei pơla thoi yơ?

"Then the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, “Thus you should speak to this people who have spoken to you, saying, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you make it lighter on us’—thus you shall say to them: ‘My little finger shall be thicker than my father’s waist!","Lu bơngai tơdăm iung hơdai sư 'noh tơl sư: Khan kơ lu kon pơlei mă khan kơ ih.

"And now, whereas my father put a heavy yoke on you, I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scourges!’ ”","Sơ̆ 'bă inh tơ'băk ăn kơ iĕm 'long ăt trăp, na inh gô tơ'băk ăn kơ iĕm 'long ăt trăp hloh kơ 'noh dơ̆ng; 'bă inh phak iĕm hăm sơnguĕt akar, inh gô phak iĕm hăm hơguăt.”"
"So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had directed, saying, “Come back to me the third day.”","Na kơtĕch pêng năr bơih, Jêrôbôam hăm đĭ-đăng kon pơlei pơla năm tơ Rôbôam, kiơ̆ thoi nơ̆r pơtao đei khan: “Pêng năr đơ̆ng rŏng kơnh iĕm năm tơ âu.”"
"Then the king answered the people roughly, and rejected the advice which the elders had given him","Pơtao tơl tơwih kơ kon pơlei pơla hăm nơ̆r tơdrăp, sư ưh kơ tơl tơwih kơ kon pơlei pơla kiơ̆ thoi lu đe kră athei ôh."
"and he spoke to them according to the advice of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scourges!”","Sư tơl tơwih kơ lu kon pơlei pơla kiơ̆ thoi nơ̆r lu tơdăm păng khan: “'Bă inh tơ'băk ăn kơ iĕm 'long ăt trăp bơih, inh gô tơ'băk ăn kơ iĕm 'long ăt trăp hloh kơ 'noh dơ̆ng.

"So the king did not listen to the people; for the turn of events was from the LORD, that He might fulfill His word, which the LORD had spoken by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.","Thoi noh, pơtao ưh kơ mơ̆ng ôh nơ̆r kon pơlei pơla pơma, yua kơ tơdrong 'noh truh đơ̆ng Kră Yang ăn, wă pơsĭt nơ̆r Sư mă Kră Yang yua boih Ahija bơngai Silô khan kơ Jêrôbôam, kon drŏ-nglo Nêbat."
"Now when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, saying: “What share have we in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, O Israel! Now, see to your own house, O David!” So Israel departed to their tents.","Lăp lu bơngai Isơrael 'bôh pơtao ưh pă mơ̆ng lu sư bơih, lu kon pơlei pơla khan kơ pơtao “Lu nhôn hăm đei kiơ lăm Đawit?

"But Rehoboam reigned over the children of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah.","Mă-lei lu bơngai oei tơ lu pơlei lăm Juđa. Rôbôam oei pơgơ̆r lu sư."
"Then King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was in charge of the revenue; but all Israel stoned him with stones, and he died. Therefore King Rehoboam mounted his chariot in haste to flee to Jerusalem.","Pơtao Rôbôam wơh Adôram bơngai pơgơ̆r pơgŏ tơdrong jang khei, lei na lu bơngai Isơrael klơ̆m pơlôch sư păng tơmo.

"So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.","Thoi noh lu bơngai Isơrael pơm tơwih blah adrĕch hnam Đawit truh tơ dang ei."
"Now it came to pass when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had come back, they sent for him and called him to the congregation, and made him king over all Israel. There was none who followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.","Lăp lu kon pơlei Isơrael kơtơ̆ng ang Jêrôbôam brŏk bơih, lu sư wơh bơngai năm krao sư akŭm hơdai păng pôk sư pơm pơtao pơgơ̆r lu bơngai Isơrael.

"And when Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah with the tribe of Benjamin, one hundred and eighty thousand chosen men who were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, that he might restore the kingdom to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.","Lăp Rôbôam truh tơ pơlei Jêrusalem bơih, sư krao akŭm đĭ-đăng adrĕch Juđa păng adrĕch adrung Bênjamin đei minh-hrĕng tơhngam-jĭt rơbâu 'nu linh tơblah, wă tơblah hăm bơngai Isơrael, wă iŏk tơwih teh đak 'noh ăn kơ Rôbôam, kon drŏ-nglo Sôlômôn."
"But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying","Mă-lei nơ̆r Kră Yang 'Bok kei-Dei khan kơ Semaia bơngai Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei wơh"
"“Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, saying","Ih athei khan kơ Rôbôam, kon drŏ-nglo Sôlômôn, pơtao Juđa, đĭ-đăng adrĕch Juđa, Bênjamin păng lu kon pơlei mă oei oei tơ noh"
"‘Thus says the LORD: “You shall not go up nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel. Let every man return to his house, for this thing is from Me.” ’ ” Therefore they obeyed the word of the LORD, and turned back, according to the word of the LORD.","'Nâu Kră Yang khan: 'Nĕ kơ năm tŏk blah lu bơngai Isơrael 'nhŏng oh iĕm.

"Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the mountains of Ephraim, and dwelt there. Also he went out from there and built Penuel.","Jêrôbôam pơjing hnam tơ Pơlei Sechem kơjăp tơ kơpal groi Êphraim, sư oei hloi tơ noh, sư lĕch đơ̆ng noh năm pơm Pơlei Pênuel."
"And Jeroboam said in his heart, “Now the kingdom may return to the house of David","Jêrôbôam tơchĕng lăm đon sư: “Dêh char pơtao âu gô brŏk hơlơ̆k tơ adrĕch Đawit."
"If these people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then the heart of this people will turn back to their lord, Rehoboam king of Judah, and they will kill me and go back to Rehoboam king of Judah.”","Tơdah lu kon pơlei 'nâu tŏk năm wă pơyơ̆r tơmam soi lăm Hnam Akŭm Kră Yang tơ pơlei Jêrusalem, lei jơhngơ̆m đon lu sư gô kiơ̆ pơtao lu sư Rôbôam pơtao đe Juđa,” lu sư gô pơlôch lê̆ inh, na lu sư gô brŏk tơ Rôbôam pơtao đe Juđa."
"Therefore the king asked advice, made two calves of gold, and said to the people, “It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Here are your gods, O Israel, which brought you up from the land of Egypt!”","Thoi noh pơtao pơđâu athei đe pơm 'bar tŏ rup rơmo păng maih, pơtao khan kơ kon pơlei pơla: “Lu iĕm tŏk năm chă kiơ tơ pơlei Jêrusalem ataih dêh!

"And he set up one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan.","Sư dan minh pôm rup yang lăm pơlei Bethel, minh pôm rup nai sư dan lăm pơlei Đan."
"Now this thing became a sin, for the people went to worship before the one as far as Dan.","Tơdrong noh jing tơdrong yoch, lu kon pơlei pơla năm tơ pơlei Đan kơkuh kơ minh pôm rup yang rơmo tơ noh."

"Jeroboam ordained a feast on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, like the feast that was in Judah, and offered sacrifices on the altar. So he did at Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had made. And at Bethel he installed the priests of the high places which he had made.","Jêrôbôam kư̆m đei tơchĕng wă pơjing minh tơdrong pơm giĕng lăm khei tơhngam năr mơjĭt-pơđăm, thoi đe juăt kơ pơm giĕng lăm dêh Juđa, na sư pơyơ̆r lu tơmam soi tơ kơpal chơnang.

"So he made offerings on the altar which he had made at Bethel on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, in the month which he had devised in his own heart.

"And behold, a man of God went from Judah to Bethel by the word of the LORD, and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.","Đơ̆ng Nơ̆r Kră Yang wơh na minh 'nu bơngai mă jang kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lĕch đơ̆ng char Juđa năm tơ pơlei Bethel, kơplah Jêrôbôam oei dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t chơnang soi wă soh pơgang 'bâu phu."
"Then he cried out against the altar by the word of the LORD, and said, “O altar, altar!

"And he gave a sign the same day, saying, “This is the sign which the LORD has spoken: Surely the altar shall split apart, and the ashes on it shall be poured out.”","Lăm năr noh, 'bok khan lê̆ adrol tơ'bôh minh tơdrong hlĭch, khan: “'Nâu tơdrong tơ'bôh hlĭch mă Kră Yang đei khan bơih: Chơnang soi gô pơchah tơnuh gô tơsĭ huŏng đĭ tơ teh.”"
"So it came to pass when King Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, who cried out against the altar in Bethel, that he stretched out his hand from the altar, saying, “Arrest him!” Then his hand, which he stretched out toward him, withered, so that he could not pull it back to himself.","Kơplah pơtao Jêrôbôam kơtơ̆ng bơngai đơ̆ng Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei pơma ôr blah hăm chơnang soi tơ pơlei Bethel, na pơtao Jêrôbôam chro đơ̆ng chơnang soi yơ̆r ti păng khan: “Rôp sư bĕ!” Ti đêl sư chro tơhlâu tơ bơngai mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua 'noh Kră Yang pơm kơ ti sư arăng kro hloi, ưh pă gơh kơchôt dơ̆ng."
"The altar also was split apart, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.","Chơnang soi pơchah hloi păng tơnuh tơsĭ tơ teh, 'blep thoi tơdrong đei tơ'bôh hlĭch đơ̆ng bơngai mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua ei chu nơ̆r Kră Yang bơtho khan."
"Then the king answered and said to the man of God, “Please entreat the favor of the LORD your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored to me.” So the man of God entreated the LORD, and the king’s hand was restored to him, and became as before.","Pơtao khan kơ bơngai đơ̆ng Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua: “Apinh ih krao khan bĕ apinh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ih, apinh ih krao khan tơgŭm inh, wă kơ ti inh gơh klaih thoi so.” Bơngai mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua ei krao khan apinh Kră Yang na ti pơtao klaih gơh kơchôt thoi so hloi."
"Then the king said to the man of God, “Come home with me and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.”","Na pơtao khan kơ bơngai mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua: “Apinh ih brŏk tơ hnam sŏng sa hơdai hăm inh, inh gô ăn kơ ih tơmam.”"

"So he went another way and did not return by the way he came to Bethel.","Thoi noh, sư wih brŏk trong nai, sư ưh pă năm rok trong đêl, sư năm tơ pơlei Bethel."
"Now an old prophet dwelt in Bethel, and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel; they also told their father the words which he had spoken to the king.","Đei minh 'nu bơngai khan lê̆ adrol kră bơih oei lăm Pơlei Bethel, lu kon drŏ-nglo sư ră roi ăn kơ sư dôm tơdrong đêl bơngai đơ̆ng 'Bok Kei-Dei đei pơm tơ Pơlei Bethel lăm năr 'noh, păng dôm nơ̆r sư đei pơma hăm pơtao.

"And their father said to them, “Which way did he go?” For his sons had seen which way the man of God went who came from Judah.","'Bă lu sư jet. “Lei bơngai 'noh sư brŏk năm trong ayơ?” Na lu kon drŏ-nglo sư tơhlâu ăn kơ 'bă sư trong bơngai mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua ei đơ̆ng char Juđa noh brŏk."
"Then he said to his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” So they saddled the donkey for him; and he rode on it","Sư khan kơ lu kon drŏ-nglo sư: “Tơlĕch ăn kơ inh aseh iĕ” lu kon drŏ-nglo sư tơlĕch ăn kơ sư aseh sư hao hloi."
"and went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak. Then he said to him, “Are you the man of God who came from Judah?” And he said, “I am.”","Sư druh kiơ̆ bơngai mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua ei, tơ'bơ̆p sư oei ngôi ala tơm 'long kôih, Sư jet: “Hăm trŏ kơ ih bơngai đơ̆ng char Juđa mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua?” Bơngai ei tơl: “Trŏ kơ inh bơih.”"
"Then he said to him, “Come home with me and eat bread.”","Bơngai khan lê̆ adrol kră 'noh khan kơ sư: “Bĕ kiơ̆ inh brŏk tơ hnam sŏng sa.”"
"And he said, “I cannot return with you nor go in with you; neither can I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place.","Mă-lei bơngai 'noh tơl sư: “Inh ưh kơ gơh brŏk hơdai ih. Kŭm ưh kơ gơh sŏng sa dah nhă đak hơdai hăm ih tơ anih 'nâu mơ̆n."
"For I have been told by the word of the LORD, ‘You shall not eat bread nor drink water there, nor return by going the way you came.’ ”","Đei nơ̆r Kră Yang khan bơih kơ inh. Ih 'nĕ kơ sŏng sa dah nhă đak tơ anih 'noh, kư̆m 'nĕ kơ brŏk rok trong đêl ih năm.”"
"He said to him, “I too am a prophet as you are, and an angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD, saying, ‘Bring him back with you to your house, that he may eat bread and drink water.’ ” (He was lying to him.)","Bơngai khan lê̆ adrol kră 'noh tơl sư khan: “Inh kư̆m dai bơngai khan lê̆ adrol lei-lăi thoi ih.

"So he went back with him, and ate bread in his house, and drank water.","Thoi ei bơngai mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua ei chu kiơ̆, sŏng sa nhă đak tơ hnam sư."
"Now it happened, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came to the prophet who had brought him back","Kơplah bre sư oei ngôi 'bơ̆t gơ'bang sŏng sa, đei nơ̆r Kră Yang khan kơ bơngai khan lê̆ adrol kră mă chông ba sư brŏk 'noh."
"and he cried out to the man of God who came from Judah, saying, “Thus says the LORD: ‘Because you have disobeyed the word of the LORD, and have not kept the commandment which the LORD your God commanded you","Bơngai kră ôr khan kơ bơngai mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua mă sư đơ̆ng dêh Juđa 'noh khan: “Kră Yang khan: Yua kơ ih ưh kơ chu nơ̆r Kră Yang, păng ưh kơ wei răk nơ̆r Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei tơtă pơkă kơ ih."
"but you came back, ate bread, and drank water in the place of which the LORD said to you, “Eat no bread and drink no water,” your corpse shall not come to the tomb of your fathers.’ ”","Ih brŏk păng sŏng sa nhă đak tơ anih mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ưh kơ ăn ih sŏng sa nhă đak.

"So it was, after he had eaten bread and after he had drunk, that he saddled the donkey for him, the prophet whom he had brought back.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ bơngai mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua ei sŏng sa păng nhă đak đang boih, na bơngai khan lê̆ adrol kră mă chông sư brŏk ăn kơ sư aseh hao brŏk."
"When he was gone, a lion met him on the road and killed him. And his corpse was thrown on the road, and the donkey stood by it. The lion also stood by the corpse.","Sư brŏk oei rok trong tơ'bơ̆p dăm-brang châu pơlôch sư hloi, lê̆ akâu sư 'bơ̆t trong, aseh păng dăm-brang dơ̆ng gah cheng."
"And there, men passed by and saw the corpse thrown on the road, and the lion standing by the corpse. Then they went and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.","Đei bơngai năm trong 'noh 'bôh akâu bơngai lôch păng dăm-brang dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t cheng, na năm roi ăn tôm tơdrong kơ lu bơngai oei lăm pơlei 'bok mă khan lê̆ adrol kră 'noh oei."
"Now when the prophet who had brought him back from the way heard it, he said, “It is the man of God who was disobedient to the word of the LORD. Therefore the LORD has delivered him to the lion, which has torn him and killed him, according to the word of the LORD which He spoke to him.”","Lăp bơngai khan lê̆ adrol kră bơngai mă chông ba sư brŏk kơtơ̆ng thoi noh, na khan: Sư 'noh bơngai Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei, ưh kơ chu nơ̆r Kră Yang.

"And he spoke to his sons, saying, “Saddle the donkey for me.” So they saddled it.","Sư khan hloi kơ lu kon drŏ-nglo sư: Tơlĕch ăn kơ 'bă aseh, na lu kon sư tơlĕch ăn aseh kơ 'bă sư."
"Then he went and found his corpse thrown on the road, and the donkey and the lion standing by the corpse. The lion had not eaten the corpse nor torn the donkey.","Sư năm tơ noh 'bôh akâu bơngai lôch 'noh 'bơ̆t trong, hăm aseh păng dăm-brang dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t cheng, dăm-brang ưh kơ sa akâu bơngai lôch păng kư̆m ưh kơchâu aseh 'noh."
"And the prophet took up the corpse of the man of God, laid it on the donkey, and brought it back. So the old prophet came to the city to mourn, and to bury him.","'Bok khan lê̆ adrol kră 'noh atŏk akâu bơngai mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua noh tơ kơpal kơdŭ aseh, chơ ba sư brŏk tơ pơlei sư, nhơ̆m hmoi pơdong păng 'bŭ hơmet."
"Then he laid the corpse in his own tomb; and they mourned over him, saying, “Alas, my brother!”","Sư 'bŭ atâu 'noh lăm bơsat sư kơdih, nhơ̆m hmoi kơ bơngai mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua. Ơ! Mơnat oh inh."
"So it was, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, “When I am dead, then bury me in the tomb where the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.","Đang kơ 'bŭ bơngai 'noh, na sư khan kơ lu kon drŏ-nglo sư: Layơ 'bă lôch lu iĕm athei 'bŭ 'bă lăm bơsat mă bơ̆n 'bŭ akâu bơngai mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua, 'măn kơting inh 'bơ̆t cheng kơting bơngai 'noh."
"For the saying which he cried out by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel, and against all the shrines on the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, will surely come to pass.”","Yua kơ dôm nơ̆r sư pơma chu nơ̆r Kră Yang pơma blah chơnang soi lăm Pơlei Bethel păng lu hnam pơm yang tơ kơjung lăm dêh Samari, gô 'blep trŏ tơpă."
"After this event Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way, but again he made priests from every class of people for the high places; whoever wished, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high places.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ tơdrong noh hlôi bơih, Jêrôbôam ưh kơ weh ôh đơ̆ng tơdrong yoch kơnê̆ sư pơm 'noh, sư rai chă pôk lơ bơngai đơ̆ng lăm pơlei pơla pơm 'bok soi tơ hnam kơkuh kơ rup yang tơ lu anih kơjung bơngai bu 'maih pơm 'bok soi, sư ăn kơ bơngai 'noh pơm 'bok soi tơ rim anih kơjung."
"And this thing was the sin of the house of Jeroboam, so as to exterminate and destroy it from the face of the earth.","Tơdrong 'nâu jing tơdrong yoch kơnê̆ tih kơ adrĕch hnam Jêrôbôam pơm ăn kơ dêh char sư pơchah pơchek păng đe pơlôch đĭ-đăng đơ̆ng kơpal teh đak âu."
"At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam became sick.","Kơplah 'noh Ahija kon drŏ-nglo Jêrôbôam jĭ"
"And Jeroboam said to his wife, “Please arise, and disguise yourself, that they may not recognize you as the wife of Jeroboam, and go to Shiloh. Indeed, Ahijah the prophet is there, who told me that I would be king over this people.","Na Jêrôbôam khan kơ akăn sư. “Ih pơm thoi bơngai nai, wă kơ đe ưh kơ băt ih akăn inh.

"Also take with you ten loaves, some cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him; he will tell you what will become of the child.”","Ih chĕp ba mơjĭt tŏ 'bĕng mi dôm tŏ 'bĕng 'ngam păng chĕp ba minh pôm get đak sut, na ih năm tơ noh tơ'bơ̆p sư. Sư roi ăn kơ ih gô đei tơdrong kiơ truh kơ kon ba.”"
"And Jeroboam’s wife did so; she arose and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see, for his eyes were glazed by reason of his age.","Akăn Jêrôbôam pơm kiơ̆ thoi noh. Sư iung, năm truh tơ hnam Ahija Pơlei Silô. Măt Ahija ưh kơ bang yua kơ sư đĭ kră bơih."
"Now the LORD had said to Ahijah, “Here is the wife of Jeroboam, coming to ask you something about her son, for he is sick. Thus and thus you shall say to her; for it will be, when she comes in, that she will pretend to be another woman.”","Kră Yang khan kơ Ahija: “To akăn Jêrôbôam năm jet ih gah kon drŏ-nglo sư jĭ, na ih athei khan kơ sư păng tơl sư thoi âu. Mưh sư truh, sư pơm bơngai nai.”"
"And so it was, when Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps as she came through the door, he said, “Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why do you pretend to be another person? For I have been sent to you with bad news.","Lăp akăn Jêrôbôam truh 'bơ̆t 'măng, na Ahija kơtơ̆ng re jơ̆ng sư nơnăm na khan kơ sư: “Ơ akăn Jêrôbôam mơ̆t bĕ. Yua kơ kiơ ih pơm bơngai nai?

"Go, tell Jeroboam, ‘Thus says the LORD God of Israel: “Because I exalted you from among the people, and made you ruler over My people Israel","Roi bĕ kơ Jêrôbôam 'nâu Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael khan: “Inh pôk atŏk ih đơ̆ng lăm kon pơlei pơla, ăn kơ ih pơm pơtao Isơrael kon pơlei pơla inh."
"and tore the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it to you; and yet you have not been as My servant David, who kept My commandments and who followed Me with all his heart, to do only what was right in My eyes","Inh iŏk lê̆ teh đak đơ̆ng hnam Đawit na pơjao ăn kơ ih; mă-lei ih ưh kơ pơm rok kiơ̆ Đawit đĭch đam Inh, sư wei răk tơdrong juăt Inh păng kiơ̆ nơ̆r Inh tơtă hăm đĭ jơhngơ̆m, sư pơm tơdrong 'lơ̆ng tơpăt 'bơ̆t anăp Inh.”"
"but you have done more evil than all who were before you, for you have gone and made for yourself other gods and molded images to provoke Me to anger, and have cast Me behind your back","Ih pơm kơnê̆ dêh hloh kơ đĭ-đăng lu bơngai adrol kơ ih, pơm kơdih yang plơ̆ng man lu rup yang, wă kơ Inh hil păng hŭt lê̆ Inh tơ rŏng."
"therefore behold! I will bring disaster on the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam every male in Israel, bond and free; I will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as one takes away refuse until it is all gone.","Yua kơ tơdrong 'noh na Inh gô ăn tơdrong truh pơmat kơ hnam adrĕch Jêrôbôam, Inh gô pơlôch đĭ lu bơngai drŏ-nglo, mă bơngai rơngei dah đĭch lăm khŭl Isơrael, Inh gô soh hơpuih pơgoh hnam adrĕch Jêrôbôam, thoi đe soh tơmam 'mê̆ dĭng mă goh."
"The dogs shall eat whoever belongs to Jeroboam and dies in the city, and the birds of the air shall eat whoever dies in the field; for the LORD has spoken!” ’","Bơngai bu lăm hnam dơnŏ Jêrôbôam, dah sư lôch lăm pơlei kŏ gô hek sa, dah sư lôch tơ bri, sem păr gô choh sa, yua kơ Kră Yang khan thoi noh."
"Arise therefore, go to your own house. When your feet enter the city, the child shall die.","Thoi noh, iung brŏk bĕ, lăp ih wă mơ̆t tơ pơlei kon ih gô lôch."
"And all Israel shall mourn for him and bury him, for he is the only one of Jeroboam who shall come to the grave, because in him there is found something good toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.","Đĭ-đăng lu kon pơlei Isơrael gô nhơ̆m hmoi păng 'bŭ sư; lăm hnam dơnŏ Jêrôbôam lăp minh 'nu đĕch 'bŭ lăm bơsat, yua kơ lăm hnam Jêrôbôam lăp minh 'nu sư đĕch đei jơhngơ̆m 'lơ̆ng 'biơ̆ hăm Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael."
"“Moreover the LORD will raise up for Himself a king over Israel who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam; this is the day. What? Even now!","Kră Yang Sư kơdih gô tơiung kơ minh 'nu pơm pơtao pơgơ̆r Isơrael, sư gô pơlôch pơđĭ hnam dơnŏ Jêrôbôam lăm năr 'nâu hloi? Tơpă năr 'nâu hloi."
"For the LORD will strike Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water. He will uproot Israel from this good land which He gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River, because they have made their wooden images, provoking the LORD to anger.","Kră Yang gô teh pơrăm lu bơngai Isơrael thoi 'nhĕt trang gơlăr hoch lăm đak, sư gô buch lê̆ đơ̆ng rơh lu bơngai Isơrael đơ̆ng lăm char 'lơ̆ng rŏ, mă Kră Yang ăn kơ 'bok kơdră lu sư păng pơm kơ lu sư tơklah tơklang tơ pah to đak krong Ơphrat, yua kơ lu sư pơm gơ̆ng rup yang Asera wă tơblĕk Kră Yang."
"And He will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who sinned and who made Israel sin.”","Yua kơ Jêrôbôam pơm yoch păng pơm ăn kơ lu bơngai Isơrael jing yoch na Kră Yang achăng hŭt lu sư.”"
"Then Jeroboam’s wife arose and departed, and came to Tirzah. When she came to the threshold of the house, the child died.","Akăn Jêrôbôam iung brŏk tơ pơlei Tirsa Lăp sư 'nao truh 'bơ̆t 'măng hnam sư, 'bôh kon drŏ-nglo sư lôch bơih."
"And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD which He spoke through His servant Ahijah the prophet.","Đe 'bŭ sư, đĭ-đăng Isơrael nhơ̆m hmoi kơ sư, 'blep thoi nơ̆r Kră Yang yua 'bơ̆r Ahija 'bok khan lê̆ adrol đei khan bơih noh."
"Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he made war and how he reigned, indeed they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.","Dôm tơdrong jang nai mă Jêrôbôam đei pơm, tơdrong sư tơblah păng tơdrong sư pơgơ̆r, đei chih bơih lăm sơ̆p hla bơar hơ'mon lu pơtao Isơrael."
"The period that Jeroboam reigned was twenty-two years. So he rested with his fathers. Then Nadab his son reigned in his place.","Jêrôbôam pơgơ̆r 'bar-jĭt 'bar sơnăm, đơ̆ng noh sư lôch năm oei hơdai hăm lu 'bok kơdră sư, kon drŏ-nglo sư anăn Nađap tŏk pơgơ̆r pơtrơp sư."
"And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king. He reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put His name there. His mother’s name was Naamah, an Ammonitess.","Rôbôam kon drŏ-nglo Sôlômôn pơgơ̆r lăm dêh char Juđa; kơplah sư tŏk pơgơ̆r, sư puăn-jĭt mônh sơnăm bơih; sư pơgơ̆r mơjĭt-tơpơh sơnăm tơ Pơlei Jêrusalem, pơlei mă Kră Yang rơih đơ̆ng lăm rim adrĕch adrung Isơrael, wă 'măn Anăn Sư tơ noh.

"Now Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked Him to jealousy with their sins which they committed, more than all that their fathers had done.","Khŭl bơngai Juđa pơm yoch kơnê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang. Lu sư pơm yoch tơblĕk Kră Yang hloh kơ lu 'bok yă lu sư pơm sơ̆."
"For they also built for themselves high places, sacred pillars, and wooden images on every high hill and under every green tree.","Lu bơngai Juđa kư̆m dai pơm ăn kơ lu sư kơdih hnam kơkuh kơ lu rup yang tơ anih kơjung, pơm gơ̆ng soi păng tơmo, lu gơ̆ng rup yang Asêrim yang drŏ-kăn tơ anih groi kơjung tơ ala rim tơnơm 'long."
"And there were also perverted persons in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.","Đei lu drŏ-kăn ngôi kư̆ kă pơm đi oei tơ lăm char 'noh, lu sư pơm tơdrong yoch kơnê̆ krưp dêh thoi lu adrĕch adrung mă Kră Yang areh pơpuh tơweh lê̆ bơih đơ̆ng anăp lu bơngai Isơrael."
"It happened in the fifth year of King Rehoboam that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem.","Lăm sơnăm mă pơđăm lăm chăl Rôbôam pơgơ̆r, pơtao Êyiptơ anăn Sisak, sư tŏk blah pơlei Jêrusalem."
"And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king’s house; he took away everything. He also took away all the gold shields which Solomon had made.","Pơtao noh blah iŏk đĭ tơmam yua đơ̆ng lăm hnam Kră Yang păng đơ̆ng lăm hnam pơtao. Sư kư̆m chĕp ba pơđĭ lu khêl mă Sôlômôn pơm păng maih 'noh."
"Then King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who guarded the doorway of the king’s house.","Pơtao Rôbôam wơh bơngai pơm khêl păng kong tơplih kơ khêl 'noh, sư pơjao ăn kơ lu yŏng linh gak 'măng jang hnam pơtao."
"And whenever the king entered the house of the LORD, the guards carried them, then brought them back into the guardroom.","Rim wơ̆t pơtao năm mơ̆t lăm Hnam Kră Yang, lu bơngai gak kiơ̆ chĕp khêl 'noh, đang bơih lu sư năm ming pơdrâu tơ lăm anih lu bơngai gak noh dơ̆ng."
"Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?","Pôm lu tơdrong jang mă Rôbôam đei pơm păng dôm tơdrong jang nai mă sư pơm bơih, đe đei chih răk lê̆ bơih lăm sơ̆p hla bơar hơ'mon kơ lu pơtao Juđa."
"And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.","Rôbôam hăm Jêrôbôam bre sư tơblah băl ling-lang ưh kơ pơdơh."
"So Rehoboam rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David. His mother’s name was Naamah, an Ammonitess. Then Abijam his son reigned in his place.","Rôbôam lôch năm oei hơdai hăm lu 'bok kơdră sư. Đe 'bŭ sư hơdai hăm lu 'bok kơdră sư tơ pơlei Đawit. Mĕ sư anăn Naama, bơngai Ammôn.

"In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam the son of Nebat, Abijam became king over Judah.","Lăm sơnăm mă mơjĭt-tơhngam chăl Jêrôbôam kon drŏ-nglo Nêbat pơgơ̆r, Abijam pơtơm pơm pơtao pơgơ̆r dêh char Juđa."
"He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Maachah the granddaughter of Abishalom.","Sư pơgơ̆r pêng sơnăm lăm Pơlei Jêrusalem. Mĕ sư anăn Maaka kon drŏ-kăn Abisalom."
"And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him; his heart was not loyal to the LORD his God, as was the heart of his father David.","Sư năm kiơ̆ đĭ trong tơdrong yoch mă 'bă sư đei pơm bơih adrol kơ sư; lăm jơhngơ̆m sư ưh kơ pơm tơdrong 'lơ̆ng tơpăt 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei sư, thoi jơhngơ̆m 'bok kơdră sư pơm."
"Nevertheless for David’s sake the LORD his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, by setting up his son after him and by establishing Jerusalem","Mă-lei yua kơ Đawit, na Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ăn kơ sư minh pôm ŭnh kơđeng lăm pơlei Jêrusalem, ăn kơ kon drŏ-nglo sư pơgơ̆r pơtrơp sư, pơm ăn kơ pơlei Jêrusalem oei kơjăp"
"because David did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, and had not turned aside from anything that He commanded him all the days of his life, except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.","yua kơ Đawit đei pơm bơih 'lơ̆ng tơpăt 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, sư pơm kiơ̆ tôm tơdrong mă Kră Yang tơtă kơ sư lăm đĭ chăl arih sư, lăp minh tơdrong pơm glăi hăm Uri bơngai Hêtit đĕch."
"And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.","Rôbôam păng Jêrôbôam tơblah băl ling-lang dĭng đĭ chăl Abijam pơgơ̆r."
"Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.","Lu tơdrong jang păng tơdrong Abijam đei pơm bơih, đe chih răk lê̆ lăm sơ̆p hla bơar hơ'mon lu pơtao đe Juđa? Abijam păng Jêrôbôam kư̆m tơblah băl."
"So Abijam rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the City of David. Then Asa his son reigned in his place.","Abijam lôch năm oei hơdai hăm 'bok kơdră sư; đe 'bŭ sư lăm pơlei Đawit. Asa kon drŏ-nglo sư pơgơ̆r pơtrơp sư."
"In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Asa became king over Judah.","Lăm sơnăm mă 'bar-jĭt chăl Jêrôbôam pơm pơtao đe Isơrael, Asa tŏk pơm pơtao pơgơ̆r char Juđa."
"And he reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem. His grandmother’s name was Maachah the granddaughter of Abishalom.","Sư pơgơ̆r puăn-jĭt mônh sơnăm lăm pơlei Jêrusalem. Yă tơm gah 'bă sư anăn Maaka kon drŏ-kăn Abisalom."
"Asa did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, as did his father David.","Asa pơm 'lơ̆ng tơpăt 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, thoi Đawit 'bok kơdră sư đei pơm."
"And he banished the perverted persons from the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.","Sư pơpuh tơlĕch lu bơngai drŏ-nglo ngôi kư̆ kă pơm đi đơ̆ng lăm char sư pơgơ̆r păng teh pơchah pơđĭ lu rup yang mă đêl lu 'bok kơdră sư pơm."
"Also he removed Maachah his grandmother from being queen mother, because she had made an obscene image of Asherah. And Asa cut down her obscene image and burned it by the Brook Kidron.","Sư kư̆m plôh tơlĕch yă sư Maaka đơ̆ng pơm yă pơtao lăm hnam pơtao, yua kơ yă sư man gơ̆ng rup yang Asêra drŏ-kăn mă kơnê̆ krưp dêh.

"But the high places were not removed. Nevertheless Asa’s heart was loyal to the LORD all his days.","Sư ưh kơ yuih hŭt lê̆ ôh lu anih kơjung đe pơm yang, mă-lei jơhngơ̆m Asa pơm 'lơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang truh đĭ chăl arih sư."
"He also brought into the house of the LORD the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which he himself had dedicated: silver and gold and utensils.","Sư chĕp ba tah lăm hnam Kră Yang hu, maih păng dôm tơmam kăl đơ̆ng 'bă sư păng đơ̆ng sư kơdih pơyơ̆r."
"Now there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.","Asa pơtao đe Juđa, Baasa pơtao đe Isơrael, bre sư tơblah băl hơnơ̆ng truh đĭ chăl arih bre sư."
"And Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.","Baasa pơtao Isơrael tŏk blah char Juđa, đơ̆ng noh sư pơm kơđông pơlei Rama, mă kơjăp wă găn bơngai Juđa kuă ăn lĕch dah mơ̆t tơ dêh char Asa pơtao Juđa."
"Then Asa took all the silver and gold that was left in the treasuries of the house of the LORD and the treasuries of the king’s house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants. And King Asa sent them to Ben-Hadad the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, who dwelt in Damascus, saying","Kơplah noh, Asa iŏk đĭ hu, maih đơ̆ng lăm Hnam Kră Yang păng đơ̆ng hnam pơtao, pơjao ăn kơ đĭch đam sư păng wơh lu sư năm tơ Ben Hadat kon drŏ-nglo Tabrimmôn, sâu Hêsiôn, pơtao Siri, oei pơgơ̆r tơ pơlei Đamas păng khan"
"“Let there be a treaty between you and me, as there was between my father and your father. See, I have sent you a present of silver and gold. Come and break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, so that he will withdraw from me.”","“Ba athei pơgơ̆p băl, thoi 'bă ba đei pơgơ̆p băl sơ̆; 'nâu tơmam hu, maih inh pơyơ̆r gơih ăn kơ ih.

"So Ben-Hadad heeded King Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel. He attacked Ijon, Dan, Abel Beth Maachah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.","Ben Hadat chu nơ̆r pơtao Asa, athei lu linh sư năm tơblah hăm lu kon pơlei Isơrael. Sư blah iŏk pơlei Ijôn, pơlei Đan, pơlei Abel Bet Maaka, đĭ char Kinêrot păng đĭ kơ char Naptali."
"Now it happened, when Baasha heard it, that he stopped building Ramah, and remained in Tirzah.","Baasa kơtơ̆ng tơdrong 'nâu, sư pơdơh hloi ưh pă pơm kơđông pơlei Rama dơ̆ng păng brŏk oei tơ pơlei Tirsa."
"Then King Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none was exempted. And they took away the stones and timber of Ramah, which Baasha had used for building; and with them King Asa built Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.","Đơ̆ng noh pơtao Asa pơkă kơ đĭ-đăng bơngai Juđa, ưh kơ lê̆ minh 'nu bơngai bu, lu sư pŭ iŏk lu tơmo păng lu 'long tơ̆r mă đêl Baasa yua pơm kơđông pơlei Rama; đơ̆ng noh pơtao Asa yua tơmam 'noh pơm pơlei Gêba lăm char Bênjamin, păng pơlei Mispa."
"The rest of all the acts of Asa, all his might, all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.","Tơdrong jang nai mă Asa pơm păng tơdrong pơgơ̆r đei yua, dôm tơdrong sư đei pơm păng dôm lu pơlei sư đei tơiung pơjing đei chih răk lê̆ lăm sơ̆p hla bơar lu pơtao đe Juđa.

"So Asa rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David his father. Then Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place.","Asa lôch năm oei hơdai hăm lu 'bok kơdră sư; păng đe 'bŭ sư hơdai hăm lu 'bok kơdră sư tơ pơlei Đawit 'bok sư. Jêhôsaphat kon drŏ-nglo sư pơgơ̆r pơtrơp sư."
"Now Nadab the son of Jeroboam became king over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years.","Lăm sơnăm mă 'bar chăl Asa pơm pơtao đe Juđa, Nađap kon drŏ-nglo Jêrôbôam pơm pơtao pơgơ̆r lu bơngai Isơrael, sư pơgơ̆r lăm 'bar sơnăm."
"And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin by which he had made Israel sin.","Sư pơm tơdrong yoch kơnê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, năm kiơ̆ trong pơm yoch thoi 'bă sư đei pơm bơih, pơm kơ lu bơngai Isơrael pơm yoch kiơ̆."
"Then Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him. And Baasha killed him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines, while Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon.","Baasa kon drŏ-nglo Ahija adrĕch hnam Isakar chă đon wă pơm kơnê̆ kơ sư, lăm kơplah Nađap păng lu bơngai Isơrael wang blah iŏk pơlei Gibêthôn, pơlei lu bơngai Philistin.

"Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his place.","Sơnăm mă pêng lăm chăl Asa pơm pơtao đe Juđa Baasa pơlôch Nađap păng pơm pơtao pơgơ̆r tơplih hloi."
"And it was so, when he became king, that he killed all the house of Jeroboam. He did not leave to Jeroboam anyone that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according to the word of the LORD which He had spoken by His servant Ahijah the Shilonite","Lăp sư 'nao pơm pơtao, sư pơlôch pơđĭ lu bơngai gah adrĕch hnam Jêrôbôam, ưh kơ lê̆ minh 'nu bơngai bu arih, lăm hnam dơnŏ Jêrôbôam sư kư̆m pơlôch pơđĭ kiơ̆ thoi nơ̆r Kră Yang yua 'bơ̆r Ahija đĭch đam Sư pơlei Silô."
"because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he had sinned and by which he had made Israel sin, because of his provocation with which he had provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger.","Tơdrong noh yua kơ đơ̆ng tơdrong yoch Jêrôbôam pơm kơ lu bơngai Isơrael dai pơm yoch păng pơm tơblĕk Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei đe Isơrael."
"Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?","Tơdrong jang nai păng dôm tơdrong jang mă Nađap đei pơm đe đei chih lê̆ bơih lăm sơ̆p hla bơar hơ'mon lu pơtao đe Isơrael?"
"And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.","Asa pơtao đe Juđa păng Baasa pơtao Isơrael tơblah băl hơnơ̆ng truh đĭ chăl arih bre sư."
"In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha the son of Ahijah became king over all Israel in Tirzah, and reigned twenty-four years.","Lăm sơnăm mă pêng lăm chăl Asa pơm pơtao đe Juđa, Baasa kon drŏ-nglo Ahija pơm pơtao pơgơ̆r đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael tơ pơlei Tirsa păng sư pơgơ̆r 'bar-jĭt puăn sơnăm."
"He did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin by which he had made Israel sin.","Sư pơm tơdrong yoch kơnê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, sư năm kiơ̆ trong Jêrôbôam păng tơdrong yoch sư, sư kư̆m pơm ăn kơ bơngai Isơrael dai wang pơm yoch kiơ̆."
"Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani, against Baasha, saying","Đei nơ̆r Kră Yang tơbăt kơ Jêhu, kon drŏ-nglo Hanani nơ̆r noh tơblah hăm Baasa"
"“Inasmuch as I lifted you out of the dust and made you ruler over My people Israel, and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam, and have made My people Israel sin, to provoke Me to anger with their sins","Inh tơiung atŏk ih đơ̆ng 'mui teh ăn kơ ih pơm pơtao lu kon pơlei pơla Isơrael Inh.

"surely I will take away the posterity of Baasha and the posterity of his house, and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.","Yua kơ thoi noh na Inh gô pơlôch pơgoh lê̆ Baasa, păng đĭ hnam dơnŏ adrĕch sư, Inh gô pơm kơ hnam sư răm đĭ, thoi hnam Jêrôbôam kon drŏ-nglo Nêbat."
"The dogs shall eat whoever belongs to Baasha and dies in the city, and the birds of the air shall eat whoever dies in the fields.”","Bơngai bu gah hnam Baasa lôch lăm pơlei, kŏ gô sa păng tơdah lôch tơ bri sem păr gô choh sa."
"Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?","Dôm tơdrong jang nai Baasa păng tơdrong mă sư đei pơm bơih đe đei chih lê̆ bơih lăm sơ̆p hla bơar hơ'mon lu pơtao đe Isơrael."
"So Baasha rested with his fathers and was buried in Tirzah. Then Elah his son reigned in his place.","Baasa lôch năm oei hơdai hăm lu 'bok kơdră sư, păng đe 'bŭ sư tơ Pơlei Tirsa. Êlah kon drŏ-nglo sư pơgơ̆r pơtrơp sư."
"And also the word of the LORD came by the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha and his house, because of all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD in provoking Him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam, and because he killed them.","Đei dơ̆ng nơ̆r Kră Yang khan kơ Jêhu 'bok khan lê̆ adrol, kon Hanani, nơ̆r noh blah Baasa păng adrĕch sư, yua kơ tơdrong yoch kơnê̆ mă sư đei pơm 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, păng tơblĕk Kră Yang hăm tơdrong sư pơm, sư pơm rok thoi adrĕch hnam Jêrôbôam păng yua kơ sư pơlôch pơrăm adrĕch hnam noh."
"In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha became king over Israel, and reigned two years in Tirzah.","Lăm sơnăm mă 'bar-jĭt tơdrâu, chăl Asa pơm pơtao đe Juđa, Êlah kon drŏ-nglo Baasa tŏk pơm pơtao đe Isơrael. Sư oei tơ Pơlei Tirsa, pơgơ̆r lăp 'bar sơnăm đĕch."
"Now his servant Zimri, commander of half his chariots, conspired against him as he was in Tirzah drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, steward of his house in Tirzah.","Simri bơngai pơm yŏng wei-lăng minh puăt gre aseh sư, chă đon pơm kơnê̆ kơ sư.

"And Zimri went in and struck him and killed him in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his place.","Simri mơ̆t lăm hnam teh păng 'bet pơlôch hloi Êla lăm sơnăm mă 'bar-jĭt tơpơh chăl Asa pơm pơtao đe Juđa, đơ̆ng noh Sư tŏk pơm pơtao pơtrơp hloi."
"Then it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he was seated on his throne, that he killed all the household of Baasha; he did not leave him one male, neither of his relatives nor of his friends.","Lăp Simri tŏk pơm pơtao, sư pơlôch pơđĭ bơngai lăm hnam Baasa ưh kơ lê̆ minh 'nu drŏ-nglo ayơ, mă khan lăm adrĕch adrung dah buăl juăt."
"Thus Zimri destroyed all the household of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which He spoke against Baasha by Jehu the prophet","Thoi noh Simri pơlôch pơđĭ boih adrĕch hnam Baasa, kiơ̆ thoi nơ̆r Kră Yang đei khan bơih kơ Jêhu 'bok khan lê̆ adrol nơ̆r noh blah Baasa"
"for all the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah his son, by which they had sinned and by which they had made Israel sin, in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their idols.","yua kơ tơdrong yoch Baasa păng Êlah kon drŏ-nglo sư đei pơm, păng tơdrong sư pơm ăn kơ lu bơngai Isơrael dai wang pơm yoch rok sư, tơblĕk Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael hăm tơdrong lu sư pơm kơkuh kơ rup yang."
"Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?","Dôm tơdrong jang nai Êlah pơm, đe đei chih lê̆ bơih tơ lăm sơ̆p hla bơar hơ'mon lu pơtao đe Isơrael."
"In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri had reigned in Tirzah seven days. And the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.","Lăm sơnăm mă 'bar-jĭt tơpơh chăl Asa pơm pơtao đe Juđa, Simri pơgơ̆r 'nao lăp tơpơh năr tơ lăm Pơlei Tirsa.

"Now the people who were encamped heard it said, “Zimri has conspired and also has killed the king.” So all Israel made Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp.","Lăp lu linh lăm kơđông kơtơ̆ng đe khan Simri blơ̆ păng pơlôch pơtao.

"Then Omri and all Israel with him went up from Gibbethon, and they besieged Tirzah.","Na Ômri păng đĭ-đăng kon pơlei Isơrael tŏk đơ̆ng Pơlei Gibêthôn năm wang tơ Pơlei Tirsa."
"And it happened, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the citadel of the king’s house and burned the king’s house down upon himself with fire, and died","Lăp Simri 'bôh đe wang tăp dăr kơ pơlei bơih na sư mơ̆t tơ lăm kơđông hnam pơtao mă kơjăp dêh, na sư soh hnam pơtao păng akâu sư lôch hloi lăm noh."
"because of the sins which he had committed in doing evil in the sight of the LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he had committed to make Israel sin.","'Noh yua kơ đơ̆ng tơdrong yoch sư pơm, pơm tơdrong kơnê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, rok kiơ̆ trong Jêrôbôam, kơdih akâu sư pơm yoch păng pơm ăn kơ Isơrael jing yoch kiơ̆."
"Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and the treason he committed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?","Dôm tơdrong jang nai mă Simri pơm păng tơdrong Simri chă đon pơdăr blơ̆ pơtao đe đei chih lê̆ bơih tơ lăm sơ̆p hla bơar hơ'mon lu pơtao đe Isơrael."
"Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king, and half followed Omri.","Lu bơngai Isơrael tơklah jing 'bar khŭl; minh khŭl kiơ̆ Tipni, kon drŏ-nglo Ginat, wă pôk sư pơm pơtao; minh khŭl kiơ̆ Ômri."
"But the people who followed Omri prevailed over the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath. So Tibni died and Omri reigned.","Mă-lei khŭl Ômri pran hloh kơ khŭl kiơ̆ Tipni, kon drŏ-nglo Ginat. Thoi noh Tipni lôch na Ômri pơm pơtao."
"In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri became king over Israel, and reigned twelve years. Six years he reigned in Tirzah.","Lăm sơnăm mă pêng-jĭt mônh lăm chăl Asa pơm pơtao đe Juđa, Ômri tŏk pơm pơtao đe Isơrael, sư pơgơ̆r mơjĭt-'bar sơnăm. Sư pơgơ̆r oei lăm Pơlei Tirsa tơdrâu sơnăm."
"And he bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver; then he built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, Samaria, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill.","Sư răt groi Samari đơ̆ng 'bok Sêmer 'bar hlak talâng hu; tơ kơpal groi 'noh sư pơjing minh pôm pơlei kơjăp sư anăn pơlei 'noh Samari, anăn kiơ̆ tơ'ngla groi noh."
"Omri did evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse than all who were before him.","Ômri pơm kơnê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang. Sư pơm tơdrong kơnê̆ hloh kơ đĭ-đăng lu bơngai adrol kơ sư."

"Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and the might that he showed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?","Tơdrong jang nai mă Ômri pơm, păng tơdrong sư gơh pơgơ̆r, đe đei chih bơih lăm sơ̆p hla bơar hơ'mon lu pơtao đe Isơrael."
"So Omri rested with his fathers and was buried in Samaria. Then Ahab his son reigned in his place.","Ômri lôch năm oei hơdai hăm lu 'bok kơdră sư, đe 'bŭ sư lăm Pơlei Samari. Ahap kon drŏ-nglo sư, pơm pơtao pơgơ̆r pơtrơp sư."
"In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, Ahab the son of Omri became king over Israel; and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years.","Lăm sơnăm mă pêng-jĭt tơhngam, chăl Asa pơm pơtao đe Juđa, Ahap kon drŏ-nglo Ômri pơm pơtao đe Isơrael tơ Pơlei Samari 'bar-jĭt 'bar sơnăm."

"And it came to pass, as though it had been a trivial thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took as wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Sidonians; and he went and served Baal and worshiped him.","Sư lăng pơm yoch rok thoi Jêrôbôam kon drŏ-nglo Nêbat iĕ đĕch, sư iŏk Jêsebel kon drŏ-kăn Êtbaal pơtao đe Siđôn pơm akăn; sư bơ̆jang kơ yang Baal păng kơkuh kơ yang 'noh."
"Then he set up an altar for Baal in the temple of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.","Sư pơm chơnang soi ăn kơ yang Baal lăm hnam yang Baal lăm Pơlei Samari."
"And Ahab made a wooden image. Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him.","Ahap kư̆m man minh pôm rup yang yă Asêra. Ahap pơm lơ tơdrong yoch kơnê̆, pơm tơblĕk Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei đe Isơrael hloh kơ lu pơtao đe Isơrael adrol kơ sư."
"In his days Hiel of Bethel built Jericho.

"And Elijah the Tishbite, of the inhabitants of Gilead, said to Ahab, “As the LORD God of Israel lives, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, except at my word.”","Êli bơngai Pơlei Tisbe, oei tơ Pơlei Tisbe lăm char Gileat, sư khan kơ Ahap: “Inh dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei đe Isơrael mă arih khan: Lăm sơnăm tơ anăp 'nâu, gô đei tơdrong phang-ang, tŭk păng đak 'mi ưh kơ đei jur tơ teh, dĭng truh tơ Inh đei khan dơ̆ng.”"
"Then the word of the LORD came to him, saying","Đơ̆ng noh đei nơ̆r Kră Yang khan kơ Êli"
"“Get away from here and turn eastward, and hide by the Brook Cherith, which flows into the Jordan.","“Ih athei weh đơ̆ng âu năm tơ gah hơlĕch, ôn akâu ih tơ Thong đak Kêrit, gah hơlĕch kơ đak krong Jôrđăn."
"And it will be that you shall drink from the brook, and I have commanded the ravens to feed you there.”","Ih gô nhă đak thong Kêrit 'noh păng Inh gô wơh sem ak 'me rong ih tơ noh.”"
"So he went and did according to the word of the LORD, for he went and stayed by the Brook Cherith, which flows into the Jordan.","Thoi noh na Êli chu nơ̆r Kră Yang athei sư năm oei tơ thong đak Kêrit gah hơlĕch kơ đak krong Jôrđăn."
"The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening; and he drank from the brook.","Rim pơgê kơsơ̆ ak jơngong ba ăn kơ sư 'bĕng mi păng 'nhĕm kông păng sư nhă đak thong Kêrit."
"And it happened after a while that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.","Mă-lei đơ̆ng rŏng kơ noh 'biơ̆ đak thong 'noh hrơ̆, yua kơ ưh kơ đei đak 'mi tơ lăm char noh."
"Then the word of the LORD came to him, saying","Na đei nơ̆r Kră Yang khan kơ Êli"
"“Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and dwell there. See, I have commanded a widow there to provide for you.”","“Ih athei iung weh đơ̆ng anih 'nâu năm bĕ tơ Pơlei Sarepha lăm dêh char Siđôn ih oei hloi tơ noh. Na Inh đei pơkă bơih kơ minh 'nu drŏ-kăn adro 'me rong ih tơ noh”."
"So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, indeed a widow was there gathering sticks. And he called to her and said, “Please bring me a little water in a cup, that I may drink.”","Thoi noh, sư iung năm tơ Pơlei Sarepha; lăp sư truh 'bơ̆t 'măng jang pơlei, sư 'bôh minh 'nu drŏ-kăn adro oei dônh 'long ŭnh, Êli krao drŏ-kăn adro 'noh păng khan: “Inh apinh ih sŏ đak lăm ge hơya tŏ sĕt ăn kơ inh nhă.”"
"And as she was going to get it, he called to her and said, “Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.”","Lăp drŏ-kăn adro 'noh wă năm sŏ đak, Êli krao hơlơ̆k sư dơ̆ng păng khan: “Ih athei chĕp ba ăn kơ inh 'bĕng mi hai!”"
"So she said, “As the LORD your God lives, I do not have bread, only a handful of flour in a bin, and a little oil in a jar; and see, I am gathering a couple of sticks that I may go in and prepare it for myself and my son, that we may eat it, and die.”","Drŏ-kăn adro ei tơl: “Đei Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ih oei arih băt, inh ưh pă đei minh pôm 'bĕng.

"And Elijah said to her, “Do not fear; go and do as you have said, but make me a small cake from it first, and bring it to me; and afterward make some for yourself and your son.","Mă-lei Êli khan kơ sư: “Ih 'nĕ kơ hli, ih athei brŏk pơm hloi thoi ih khan 'noh, mă adrol ih athei yua tơpŭng 'noh pơm ăn kơ inh minh pôm 'bĕng iĕ, đơ̆ng noh ba ăn kơ inh tơ âu; đơ̆ng rŏng kơ 'noh ih pơm ăn kơ ih păng kon drŏ-nglo ih."
"For thus says the LORD God of Israel: ‘The bin of flour shall not be used up, nor shall the jar of oil run dry, until the day the LORD sends rain on the earth.’ ”","Yua kơ đei nơ̆r Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei đe Isơrael khan: ‘Tơpŭng ưh kơ đĭ ôh đơ̆ng lăm ge păng đak rơmă kư̆m ưh kơ đĭ mơ̆n đơ̆ng lăm get, dĭng truh tơ năr Kră Yang ăn đak 'mi jur tơ teh.’ ”"
"So she went away and did according to the word of Elijah; and she and he and her household ate for many days.","Sư brŏk pơm kiơ̆ thoi nơ̆r Êli khan, lăm hnam dơnŏ sư păng Êli sa 'bĕng 'noh tôm mah rim năr."
"The bin of flour was not used up, nor did the jar of oil run dry, according to the word of the LORD which He spoke by Elijah.","Tơpŭng ưh kơ đĭ đơ̆ng lăm ge, đak rơmă ôliwơ kư̆m ưh kơ đĭ đơ̆ng lăm get, trŏ thoi nơ̆r Kră Yang đei yua Êli bơtho akhan."
"Now it happened after these things that the son of the woman who owned the house became sick. And his sickness was so serious that there was no breath left in him.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ 'noh kon drŏ-nglo yă tơ'ngla hnam jĭ dêh rai dêh kơtĕch jơhngơ̆m."
"So she said to Elijah, “What have I to do with you, O man of God? Have you come to me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to kill my son?”","Na yă tơ'ngla hnam 'noh khan kơ Êli. “Ơ bơngai mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua, inh hăm ih đei tơdrong kiơ?

"And he said to her, “Give me your son.” So he took him out of her arms and carried him to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him on his own bed.","Êli tơl sư: “Ăn kon ih tơ âu,” Êli glơng iŏk đơ̆ng ti mĕ sư tŏk tơ anih sư 'bĭch tơ kơpal, tơ'bĭch sư kơpal giơng."
"Then he cried out to the LORD and said, “O LORD my God, have You also brought tragedy on the widow with whom I lodge, by killing her son?”","Na sư krao khan kơ Kră Yang: “Ơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei inh!

"And he stretched himself out on the child three times, and cried out to the LORD and said, “O LORD my God, I pray, let this child’s soul come back to him.”","Đơ̆ng noh sư brom kơpal bơngai 'lơ̆p 'noh pêng wơ̆t păng krao khan kơ Kră Yang: “Ơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei inh!

"Then the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came back to him, and he revived.","Kră Yang mơ̆ng păng tơl tơwih nơ̆r Êli krao khan; bơhngol bơngai 'lơ̆p 'noh mơ̆t dơ̆ng tơ lăm akâu sư na sư iung arih dơ̆ng."
"And Elijah took the child and brought him down from the upper room into the house, and gave him to his mother. And Elijah said, “See, your son lives!”","Êli glơng bơngai 'lơ̆p 'noh đơ̆ng anih kơpal jur tơ ala, jao bơngai 'lơ̆p 'noh kơ mĕ sư păng khan, “ih lăng âu kon ih arih bơih.”"
"Then the woman said to Elijah, “Now by this I know that you are a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in your mouth is the truth.”","Yă adro noh khan kơ Êli: “Dang ei inh băt kơ ih 'nâu minh 'nu bơngai đơ̆ng Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua, dôm nơ̆r Kră Yang pơm lăm 'bơ̆r ih sĭt tơpă.”"
"And it came to pass after many days that the word of the LORD came to Elijah, in the third year, saying, “Go, present yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain on the earth.”","Đunh năr đơ̆ng noh, truh lăm sơnăm mă pêng, đei nơ̆r Kră Yang khan kơ Êli: “Ih athei năm tơ'bơ̆p Ahap; Inh gô ăn đak 'mi jruh tơ teh dơ̆ng."
"So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab; and there was a severe famine in Samaria.","Thoi noh na Êli năm tơ'bơ̆p Ahap. Kơplah noh lăm dêh char Samari đei tơdrong pơngot rơwĕt tih dêh."
"And Ahab had called Obadiah, who was in charge of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly.","Ahap krao Ôbadia bơngai wei-lăng hnam pơtao Ôbadia hli yom kơ Kră Yang dêh."
"For so it was, while Jezebel massacred the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah had taken one hundred prophets and hidden them, fifty to a cave, and had fed them with bread and water.)","Kơplah Jêsebel pơlôch lu bơngai khan lê̆ adrol mă Kră Yang yua, Ôbadia ba minh-hrĕng 'nu lu bơngai khan lê̆ adrol ôn lu sư tơ 'bar anih lăm hơgơp tơmo lăm minh anih pơđăm-jĭt 'nu, ăn kơ lu sư tơmam sa păng đak nhă."
"And Ahab had said to Obadiah, “Go into the land to all the springs of water and to all the brooks; perhaps we may find grass to keep the horses and mules alive, so that we will not have to kill any livestock.”","Ahap khan kơ Ôbadia: “Ih athei chă năm tơ jơ̆p-jang dêh char păng tơ rim kơ tu thong đak, rŏ lăng bơ̆n chă oei 'bôh đei 'nhĕt wă kơ hiĕm aseh oei arih, wă kơ lu sem dơrong huay kơ lôch hiong.”"
"So they divided the land between them to explore it; Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.","Thoi noh, na bre sư asong băl chă năm jơ̆p tơring char. Ahap sư năm trong 'nâu, Ôbadia sư năm trong to."
"Now as Obadiah was on his way, suddenly Elijah met him; and he recognized him, and fell on his face, and said, “Is that you, my lord Elijah?”","Kơplah Ôbadia oei năm rok trong Êli tơ'bơ̆p sư. Ôbadia kơnăl kơ sư na drap tơ teh păng jet: “Hăm trŏ kơ ih Êli yŏng inh ưh?”"
"And he answered him, “It is I. Go, tell your master, ‘Elijah is here.’ ”","Sư tơl: “Trŏ kơ inh bơih. Năm roi bĕ kơ yŏng ih khan: ‘Êli oei tơ âu.’ ”"
"So he said, “How have I sinned, that you are delivering your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me?","Ôbadia tơl: “Inh đei pơm tơdrong yoch kiơ, na ih pơjao inh mă đam ih lăm tơpang ti Ahap, wă kơ sư pơlôch inh?"
"As the LORD your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my master has not sent someone to hunt for you; and when they said, ‘He is not here,’ he took an oath from the kingdom or nation that they could not find you.","Inh pơma tơpăt 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ih mă oei arih, ưh kơ đei minh pôm dêh char ayơ, minh adrĕch adrung ayơ mă yŏng inh ưh kơ đei athei lu sư chă ih; păng tơdah đe khan: Êli ưh kơ đei tơ âu, sư athei dêh char dah adrĕch adrung 'noh athei pơkă gah tơdrong khan lu sư ưh kơ 'bôh ih."
"And now you say, ‘Go, tell your master, “Elijah is here” ’!","Mă-lei dang ei ih khan kơ inh: “Ih athei năm roi kơ yŏng ih: Êli oei tơ âu.”"
"And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from you, that the Spirit of the LORD will carry you to a place I do not know; so when I go and tell Ahab, and he cannot find you, he will kill me. But I your servant have feared the LORD from my youth.","Inh ưh kơ băt mưh inh weh đơ̆ng ih, kơnh Yang Bơhngol Kră Yang gô pôk hiŏng tơweh ih tơ nai, Mưh inh năm roi kơ Ahap, athei năm tơ âu na ưh kơ 'bôh ih tơ anih 'nâu lei sư gô pơlôch inh, mă khan inh đam ih, hli yom kơ Kră Yang đơ̆ng inh oei 'lơ̆p ră."
"Was it not reported to my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the LORD, how I hid one hundred men of the LORD’s prophets, fifty to a cave, and fed them with bread and water?","Kơplah Jêsebel pơlôch lu bơngai khan lê̆ adrol mă Kră Yang yua, inh năm ba minh-hrĕng 'nu bơngai khan lê̆ adrol mă Kră Yang yua chă ôn tơ 'bar anih hơgơp tơmo, tơ minh anih pơđăm-jĭt 'nu inh ăn kơ lu sư tơmam sa păng đak nhă."
"And now you say, ‘Go, tell your master, “Elijah is here.” ’ He will kill me!”","Na dang ei ih khan: “Ih athei roi bĕ kơ yŏng ih, Êli tơ âu. Sư gô pơlôch inh.”"
"Then Elijah said, “As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely present myself to him today.”","Êli tơl: “Inh dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang tih hloh oei arih, inh gô tơ'bơ̆p Ahap năr 'nâu.”"
"So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.","Thoi noh Ôbadia năm tơ'bơ̆p păng roi kơ Ahap, na Ahap năm tơ'bơ̆p Êli."
"Then it happened, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, “Is that you, O troubler of Israel?”","Lăp Ahap 'bôh Êli na sư khan kơ Êli. “Ih hă pơrŭng lu bơngai Isơrael?”"
"And he answered, “I have not troubled Israel, but you and your father’s house have, in that you have forsaken the commandments of the LORD and have followed the Baals.","Êli tơl: “Inh ưh kơ pơrŭng ôh lu bơngai Isơrael, ih păng hnam 'bă ih pơrŭng lu bơngai Isơrael, yua kơ lu iĕm hŭt lê̆ tơdrong Kră Yang tơtă na lui kiơ̆ yang Baal."
"Now therefore, send and gather all Israel to me on Mount Carmel, the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal, and the four hundred prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel’s table.”","Thoi noh ih athei bĕ đe năm krao akŭm đĭ-đăng lu bơngai Isơrael, tơ'bơ̆p inh tơ kông Karmel păng puăn-hrĕng pơđăm-jĭt 'nu lu bơngai khan lê̆ adrol gah yang Baal, păng puăn-hrĕng 'nu lu bơngai khan lê̆ adrol yang Asêra păng lu bơngai sŏng sa tơ gơ'bang Jêsebel."
"So Ahab sent for all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together on Mount Carmel.","Thoi noh Ahap athei đe năm krao akŭm đĭ-đăng lu bơngai Isơrael păng lu bơngai khan lê̆ adrol năm akŭm tơ Kông Karmel."
"And Elijah came to all the people, and said, “How long will you falter between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow Him; but if Baal, follow him.” But the people answered him not a word.","Đơ̆ng noh Êli năm dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp lu kon pơlei pơla păng khan: Lu iĕm năm ting bơring kiơ̆ 'bar pah trong 'nâu dĭng dang yơ?

"Then Elijah said to the people, “I alone am left a prophet of the LORD; but Baal’s prophets are four hundred and fifty men.","Na Êli khan kơ lu kon pơlei pơla: “Inh, lăp minh 'nu inh đĕch bơngai khan lê̆ adrol mă Kră Yang yua mă oei oei, lu bơngai khan lê̆ adrol gah yang Baal đei puăn-hrĕng pơđăm-jĭt 'nu."
"Therefore let them give us two bulls; and let them choose one bull for themselves, cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, but put no fire under it; and I will prepare the other bull, and lay it on the wood, but put no fire under it.","Chă ăn kơ nhôn 'bar tŏ rơmo tơno; ăn kơ lu sư rơih iŏk minh pôm kơdih, kăt hlơ-hlah na dan sư kơpal 'long ŭnh mă-lei 'nĕ kơ soh ŭnh, inh kư̆m dai kăt hlơ-hlah minh pôm rơmo tơno dan kơpal 'long ŭnh kư̆m ưh kơ soh ŭnh mơ̆n."
"Then you call on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD; and the God who answers by fire, He is God.” So all the people answered and said, “It is well spoken.”","Iĕm athei krao apinh anăn yang iĕm, gah inh krao apinh Anăn Kră Yang.

"Now Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Choose one bull for yourselves and prepare it first, for you are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under it.”","Êli khan kơ lu bơngai khan lê̆ adrol gah yang Baal.

"So they took the bull which was given them, and they prepared it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even till noon, saying, “O Baal, hear us!” But there was no voice; no one answered. Then they leaped about the altar which they had made.","Thoi noh lu sư iŏk rơmo dui ba tơ noh, kăt hlơ-hlah pơm hơmet, Đơ̆ng noh lu sư krao apinh hăm anăn yang Baal: Ơ Baal!

"And so it was, at noon, that Elijah mocked them and said, “Cry aloud, for he is a god; either he is meditating, or he is busy, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is sleeping and must be awakened.”","Truh năr dơ̆ng bơih Êli che bơle kơ lu sư khan: “Iĕm krao mă rơ̆n wăi, sư yang tơpă wăi.

"So they cried aloud, and cut themselves, as was their custom, with knives and lances, until the blood gushed out on them.","Kơtơ̆ng lei lu sư krao ôr rai rơ̆n, iŏk đao tơju raih akâu lu sư kơdih pham lĕch djrông djrang mang."
"And when midday was past, they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice. But there was no voice; no one answered, no one paid attention.","Lăp 'năr kơsơ̆ glơh bơih lu sư krao ôr 'bơ̆r re păng truh jơ pơyơ̆r tơmam soi phe 'ba ăn kơ yang Baal 'bơ̆t jơ kơsơ̆ ei bơih, mă-lei ưh kơ kơtơ̆ng nơ̆r kiơ, kư̆m ưh kơ đei bu tơl păng ưh kơ đei bu mă hiơ̆k ăn."
"Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come near to me.” So all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down.","Na Êli khan kơ lu kon pơlei pơla, “apinh iĕm năm jê̆ tơ âu:” Na lu kon pơlei pơla năm dơ̆ng jê̆ sư.

"And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD had come, saying, “Israel shall be your name.”","Êli iŏk mơjĭt-'bar tŏ tơmo kiơ̆ kơsô̆ mơjĭt-'bar adrĕch kon drŏ-nglo Jakôp, bơngai mă nơ̆r Kră Yang khan: “Anăn ih gô krao Isơrael."
"Then with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD; and he made a trench around the altar large enough to hold two seahs of seed.","Sư yua mơjĭt-'bar tŏ tơmo 'noh pơm minh pôm chơnang soi yua hăm Anăn Kră Yang; sư sir hơbong tăp dăr kơ chơnang soi, să sư bơ̆n gơh tah 'bar hnŏng mong găr adrĕch."
"And he put the wood in order, cut the bull in pieces, and laid it on the wood, and said, “Fill four waterpots with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood.”","Sư dan 'long ŭnh păng kăt kơnăt 'nhĕm rơmo tơno 'noh dan tơ kơpal 'long ŭnh.

"Then he said, “Do it a second time,” and they did it a second time; and he said, “Do it a third time,” and they did it a third time.","“Sư athei đe tuh đak 'măng mă 'bar dơ̆ng đe tuh đak 'măng mă 'bar. Sư khan dơ̆ng:” Iĕm athei tuh dơ̆ng 'măng mă pêng, na đe tuh 'măng mă pêng."
"So the water ran all around the altar; and he also filled the trench with water.","Dĭng đak ro tăp dăr kơ chơnang soi păng 'bĕnh kơ hơbong."
"And it came to pass, at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near and said, “LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that You are God in Israel and I am Your servant, and that I have done all these things at Your word.","Gah kơsơ̆, truh jơ pơyơ̆r tơmam soi, Êli bơngai khan lê̆ adrol năm dơ̆ng jê̆ chơnang soi 'noh păng krao khan: “Ơ Kră Yang, 'Bok Kei-Dei Abraham, Isăk păng Isơrael, năr 'nâu apinh ih ăn kơ đe băt Ih boih Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lăm khŭl bơngai Isơrael.

"Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that You are the LORD God, and that You have turned their hearts back to You again.”","Ơ Kră Yang!

"Then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood and the stones and the dust, and it licked up the water that was in the trench.","Kơplah noh ŭnh đơ̆ng Kră Yang jruh soh sa tơmam soi 'buh, 'long ŭnh, tơmo, 'mui teh păng đak lăm hơbong 'noh hrơ̆ đĭ."
"Now when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces; and they said, “The LORD, He is God! The LORD, He is God!”","Lăp kon pơlei pơla 'bôh thoi noh bơih lu sư drap brom tơ teh kơkuh păng khan: Kră Yang bơih 'Bok Kei-Dei! Kră Yang bơih 'Bok Kei-Dei!”"
"And Elijah said to them, “Seize the prophets of Baal! Do not let one of them escape!” So they seized them; and Elijah brought them down to the Brook Kishon and executed them there.","Êli khan kơ lu sư: “Rôp bĕ đĭ lu bơngai khan lê̆ adrol gah yang Baal, 'nĕ kơ ăn minh 'nu bơngai ayơ klaih.” Lu sư rôp hloi lu bơngai 'noh.

"Then Elijah said to Ahab, “Go up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.”","Êli khan kơ Ahap: “Tŏk năm, sŏng sa păng et yua kơ inh kơtơ̆ng jơwa 'mi tih.”"
"So Ahab went up to eat and drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; then he bowed down on the ground, and put his face between his knees","Na Ahap tŏk năm sŏng sa păng et, Êli tŏk tơ kơpal kông Karmel, kŭp tơ teh, muh măt sư kŭp sơlam 'bar pah kŭl-tăng sư."
"and said to his servant, “Go up now, look toward the sea.” So he went up and looked, and said, “There is nothing.” And seven times he said, “Go again.”","Sư khan kơ đam sư: “Ih năm lăng tơ gah đak dơsĭ.” Đam sư tŏk lăng, păng khan: “Inh ưh kơ đei 'bôh kiơ.” Êli khan dơ̆ng: “Ih athei năm dơ̆ng tơ noh tơpơh wơ̆t.”"
"Then it came to pass the seventh time, that he said, “There is a cloud, as small as a man’s hand, rising out of the sea!” So he said, “Go up, say to Ahab, ‘Prepare your chariot, and go down before the rain stops you.’ ”","Wơ̆t mă tơpơh, đam sư khan: “Tơ đak dơsĭ inh 'bôh hơmơ̆l tŏ tơpang ti bơngai tŏk đơ̆ng đak dơsĭ.” Êli khan. “Năm roi bĕ kơ Ahap: Apinh pơtao hơmet gre aseh jah jur năm, kơnh hli kơ 'mi pơm kơ ih ưh kơ gơh kơ năm."
"Now it happened in the meantime that the sky became black with clouds and wind, and there was a heavy rain. So Ahab rode away and went to Jezreel.","Lăp pă 'biơ̆ kơ noh đei hơmơ̆l găm suek, đei kial bah păng đei 'mi tih hloi. Ahap hao gre aseh hăt hot năm tơ Pơlei Jêsreel."
"Then the hand of the LORD came upon Elijah; and he girded up his loins and ran ahead of Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.","Ti Kră Yang chro pel akâu Êli. Sư iŏk tơlei tơ̆n, tơ̆n tơ kơiĕng păng sư kơdâu adrol kơ Ahap, truh tơ 'măng wă mơ̆t Pơlei Jêsreel."
"And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, also how he had executed all the prophets with the sword.","Ahap roi kơ yă Jêsebel dôm tơdrong Êli đei pơm boih păng thoi yơ tơdrong sư yua đao gưm pơlôch lu bơngai khan lê̆ adrol gah Baal hăm."
"Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, “So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time.”","Na yă Jêsebel athei đe năm khan kơ Êli: “Năr dơning lăm jơ 'nâu, tơdah inh ưh kơ pơrăm tơdrong arih ih, thoi ih pơrăm tơdrong arih minh 'nu lăm lu sư, lei apinh lu yang phak inh mă trăp.”"
"And when he saw that, he arose and ran for his life, and went to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there.","Thoi noh Êli hli, sư iung kơdâu weh wă pơklaih tơdrong arih sư. Sư năm truh tơ Pơlei Bêrsêba lăm char Juđa, lê̆ lu đam sư oei tơ noh."
"But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a broom tree. And he prayed that he might die, and said, “It is enough!

"And there he went into a cave, and spent the night in that place; and behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and He said to him, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”","Truh tơ noh, sư mơ̆t tơ hơgơp tơmo, 'bĭch tep lăm noh minh măng. Đei nơ̆r Kră Yang khan kơ sư: “Ơ Êli ih pơm kiơ tơ âu?”"

"Then He said, “Go out, and stand on the mountain before the LORD.” And behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind tore into the mountains and broke the rocks in pieces before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake","Kră Yang khan: “Lĕch bĕ păng dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang tơ kơpal kông, yua kơ Kră Yang wă năm trong 'noh.” Đei hloi kial tih tơthu kơtang 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, kial tơthu pơm kơ kông 'noh đah lang păng lu tơmo pơchah đĭ, mă-lei Kră Yang ưh kơ đei lăm kial 'noh.

"and after the earthquake a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire; and after the fire a still small voice.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ teh tơdrŏ đei pla ŭnh; mă-lei Kră Yang kư̆m ưh kơ oei lăm pla ŭnh. Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ pla ŭnh đei nơ̆r hơbôn pơma hơdar."
"So it was, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entrance of the cave. Suddenly a voice came to him, and said, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”","Lăp Êli kơtơ̆ng nơ̆r pơma 'noh sư iŏk ao tai gom muh măt sư, păng lĕch dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t 'măng hơgơp tơmo.

"And he said, “I have been very zealous for the LORD God of hosts; because the children of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword. I alone am left; and they seek to take my life.”","Êli tơl: “Jơhngơ̆m inh oei adrin dêh yua kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Tih Hloh, yua kơ bơngai Isơrael sơngah bơih kơ tơdrong pơgơ̆p Ih, pơrăm lê̆ chơnang soi Ih pơlôch lu bơngai khan lê̆ adrol hăm đao gưm pă minh 'nu inh oei arih, dang ei lu sư kư̆m oei chă wă pơlôch inh."
"Then the LORD said to him: “Go, return on your way to the Wilderness of Damascus; and when you arrive, anoint Hazael as king over Syria.","Kră Yang khan kơ sư: “Ih brŏk hơlơ̆k bĕ trong đêl ih năm 'noh truh tơ Pơlei Đamas.

"Also you shall anoint Jehu the son of Nimshi as king over Israel. And Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel Meholah you shall anoint as prophet in your place.","Păng tuh đak rơmă 'bâu phu kơ Jêhu kon drŏ-nglo Nimsi pôk sư pơm pơtao đe Isơrael; đơ̆ng noh ih athei tuh đak rơmă 'bâu phu kơ Êlisê kon drŏ-nglo Saphat đơ̆ng Pơlei Abel Mêhôla jing bơngai khan lê̆ adrol tơplih ih."
"It shall be that whoever escapes the sword of Hazael, Jehu will kill; and whoever escapes the sword of Jehu, Elisha will kill.","Bơngai bu klaih đơ̆ng đao gưm Hasael, Jêhu gô pơlôch sư; bu klaih đơ̆ng đao gưm Jêhu Êlisê gô pơlôch sư."
"Yet I have reserved seven thousand in Israel, all whose knees have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth that has not kissed him.”","Gah Inh đei rơih iŏk tơpơh-rơbâu 'nu bơngai Isơrael ưh kơ hơtơ̆p kŭl-tăng 'bơ̆t anăp yang Baal, 'bơ̆r lu sư tam lah chŭm sư ôh.”"
"So he departed from there, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he was with the twelfth. Then Elijah passed by him and threw his mantle on him.","Na Êli năm đơ̆ng anih 'noh tơ'bơ̆p hloi Êlisê, kon drŏ-nglo Saphat oei rơuơ chŭn hơdai hăm mơjĭt-'bar đôi rơmo rơuơ nai, sư choh rơuơ đôi rơmo mă mơjĭt-'bar.

"And he left the oxen and ran after Elijah, and said, “Please let me kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you.” And he said to him, “Go back again, for what have I done to you?”","Êlisê achăng lê̆ rơmo choh sư 'noh kơdâu kiơ̆ Êli, păng khan: “Apinh ih ăn kơ inh brŏk tơ'bơ̆p chŭm mĕ 'bă inh 'mơ̆i, đơ̆ng noh inh gô kiơ̆ ih hloi.” Êli tơl: “Năm brŏk đơ̆ng noh hơlơ̆k tơ âu dơ̆ng, inh đei ưh kơ đei pơm kiơ kơ ih ôh.”"
"So Elisha turned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen and slaughtered them and boiled their flesh, using the oxen’s equipment, and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he arose and followed Elijah, and became his servant.","Êlisê tơklah đơ̆ng Êli brŏk, sư rôp 'bet sa minh đôi rơmo, đơ̆ng noh iŏk 'long rơuơ blah pơm 'long ŭnh 'buh pai 'nhĕm rơmo, đơ̆ng noh pai ăn kơ lu đam sa.

"Now Ben-Hadad the king of Syria gathered all his forces together; thirty-two kings were with him, with horses and chariots.

"Then he sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel, and said to him, “Thus says Ben-Hadad","Sư wơh đam sư năm mơ̆t lăm pơlei tơ'bơ̆p Ahap pơtao đe Isơrael, na khan: “'Nâu nơ̆r Ben Hadat khan"

"but I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time, and they shall search your house and the houses of your servants. And it shall be, that whatever is pleasant in your eyes, they will put it in their hands and take it.’ ”","Thoi noh, pơgê dơning lăm jơ 'nâu inh gô wơh đĭch đam inh năm truh tơ hnam ih, lu sư gô chă yuih lăng dôm tơmam kiơ mă lu sư kăl lăm hnam ih păng lăm hnam đĭch đam ih, lu sư iŏk chĕp ba pơđĭ.’ ”"
"So the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, “Notice, please, and see how this man seeks trouble, for he sent to me for my wives, my children, my silver, and my gold; and I did not deny him.”","Pơtao đe Isơrael kơtơ̆ng thoi noh bơih na sư krao akŭm đĭ-đăng lu 'bok kră lăm dêh char păng khan: “Lu iĕm lăng deh thoi yơ bơngai 'nâu chă đon wă pơrăm lu bơ̆n, yua kơ sư đei wơh boih lu đĭch đam sư wă athei inh pơjao ăn kon akăn inh păng lu hu maih inh kơ sư, inh kư̆m ưh pă gơh sơngah bơih.”"

"Therefore he said to the messengers of Ben-Hadad, “Tell my lord the king, ‘All that you sent for to your servant the first time I will do, but this thing I cannot do.’ ” And the messengers departed and brought back word to him.","Thoi noh na Ahap khan kơ lu bơngai mă pơtao 'Ben Hadat wơh: “Iĕm athei khan kơ yŏng inh: Dôm tơdrong ih apinh đơ̆ng inh mă adrol 'noh inh gô pơm; mă-lei wơ̆t 'nâu inh ưh kơ gơh pơm ôh?” Lu bơngai mă đơ̆ng Ben Hadat wơh 'noh brŏk roi dôm nơ̆r 'noh."
"Then Ben-Hadad sent to him and said, “The gods do so to me, and more also, if enough dust is left of Samaria for a handful for each of the people who follow me.”","Ben Hadat wơh bơngai nai dơ̆ng tơ'bơ̆p Ahap khan: “Apinh lu yang phak inh mă trăp tơdah 'mui teh tơ Samari tôm mah kơ rim tơpang ti lu linh lăm minh 'nu minh chup.”"
"So the king of Israel answered and said, “Tell him, ‘Let not the one who puts on his armor boast like the one who takes it off.’ ”","Na Ahap tơl: “Brŏk khan kơ sư: ‘Bơngai hrŭk ao mam 'nĕ kơ pơang akâu kơdih thoi bơngai mă plôh lê̆ ao.’ ”"
"And it happened when Ben-Hadad heard this message, as he and the kings were drinking at the command post, that he said to his servants, “Get ready.” And they got ready to attack the city.","Ben Hadat oei et tơdrô hơdai hăm lu pơtao lăm kơđông, lăp sư kơtơ̆ng dôm nơ̆r 'noh, na khan hloi kơ lu linh sư: “Iĕm athei hơmet năm blah.” Đơ̆ng noh lu linh năm hloi wă blah pơlei 'noh."
"Suddenly a prophet approached Ahab king of Israel, saying, “Thus says the LORD: ‘Have you seen all this great multitude?

"So Ahab said, “By whom?” And he said, “Thus says the LORD: ‘By the young leaders of the provinces.’ ” Then he said, “Who will set the battle in order?” And he answered, “You.”","Ahap jet dơ̆ng: “Bu gô pơm tơdrong 'nâu?” 'Bok khan lê̆ adrol tơl. “'Nâu Kră Yang khan: “Ih athei yua lu bơngai tơdăm bơ̆jang ala kơ lu 'bok pơgơ̆r tơring char gô pơm.’ ” Ahap apinh dơ̆ng. “Lei bu wă pơtơm năm tơblah?” 'Bok khan lê̆ adrol tơl: “Ih bơih.”"
"Then he mustered the young leaders of the provinces, and there were two hundred and thirty-two; and after them he mustered all the people, all the children of Israel—seven thousand.","Na Ahap krao akŭm đĭ-đăng lu bơngai tơdăm bơ̆jang ala kơ lu 'bok pơgơ̆r tơring, đei 'bar-hrĕng pêng-jĭt 'bar 'nu.

"So they went out at noon. Meanwhile Ben-Hadad and the thirty-two kings helping him were getting drunk at the command post.","Lu Sư lĕch năm 'bơ̆t tŏk-bŏk 'năr dơ̆ng kơplah Ben Hadat hơdai hăm pêng-jĭt 'bar 'nu pơtao buăl dơ̆ng sư et tơdrô suai lăm kơđông."
"The young leaders of the provinces went out first.

"And each one killed his man; so the Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them; and Ben-Hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with the cavalry.","Lu sư pơlôch lu bơngai ayăt 'noh mơ̆ng kơ tơ'bơ̆p 'bơ̆t anăp.

"Then the king of Israel went out and attacked the horses and chariots, and killed the Syrians with a great slaughter.","Pơtao đe Isơrael năm blah lu linh hao aseh, pơlôch lu bơngai Siri lơ dêh."
"And the prophet came to the king of Israel and said to him, “Go, strengthen yourself; take note, and see what you should do, for in the spring of the year the king of Syria will come up against you.”","Kơplah noh 'bok khan lê̆ adrol năm dơ̆ng jê̆ pơtao đe Isơrael păng khan: “Ih athei năm pơjing ming lu linh ih mă pran kơtang đơ̆ng, ih athei lăng hơmet mă hơlen tơdrong kiơ wă pơm, yua kơ bơyan puih sơnăm anăp kơnh pơtao Siri gô năm blah ih dơ̆ng."
"Then the servants of the king of Syria said to him, “Their gods are gods of the hills.

"So do this thing: Dismiss the kings, each from his position, and put captains in their places","Apinh pơtao athei pơm thoi âu: Tơjur đĭ lu pơtao 'noh đơ̆ng anih lu sư pơgơ̆r linh, na pôk atŏk lu yŏng linh pơgơ̆r tơplih lu sư."
"and you shall muster an army like the army that you have lost, horse for horse and chariot for chariot.

"So it was, in the spring of the year, that Ben-Hadad mustered the Syrians and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel.","Lăm sơnăm đơ̆ng rŏng Ben Hadat krao akŭm lu linh Siri tŏk năm tơ Pơlei Aphek wă tơblah hăm lu bơngai Isơrael."
"And the children of Israel were mustered and given provisions, and they went against them. Now the children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of goats, while the Syrians filled the countryside.","Bơngai Isơrael kư̆m krao akŭm đĭ-đăng, hơmet tơmam sa wă tơblah.

"Then a man of God came and spoke to the king of Israel, and said, “Thus says the LORD: ‘Because the Syrians have said, “The LORD is God of the hills, but He is not God of the valleys,” therefore I will deliver all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am the LORD.’ ”","Đei minh 'nu bơngai Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua năm jê̆ pơtao Isơrael păng khan: “Kră Yang khan: Yua kơ kon pơlei Siri khan kơ Kră Yang noh yang kông, ưh kơ trŏ kơ yang thŭng dơnă ôh.

"And they encamped opposite each other for seven days. So it was that on the seventh day the battle was joined; and the children of Israel killed one hundred thousand foot soldiers of the Syrians in one day.","'Bar khŭl sư tơdơ̆ng tơklă băl lăm tơpơh năr.

"But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; then a wall fell on twenty-seven thousand of the men who were left. And Ben-Hadad fled and went into the city, into an inner chamber.","Dôm lu bơngai klaih đơ̆ng anih tơblah 'noh kơdâu ôn tơ lăm Pơlei Aphek, mă-lei dur pơlei pơchah kơtĭt lu sư lôch đei 'bar-jĭt tơpơh 'nu.

"Then his servants said to him, “Look now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings.

"So they wore sackcloth around their waists and put ropes around their heads, and came to the king of Israel and said, “Your servant Ben-Hadad says, ‘Please let me live.’ ” And he said, “Is he still alive?

"Now the men were watching closely to see whether any sign of mercy would come from him; and they quickly grasped at this word and said, “Your brother Ben-Hadad.” So he said, “Go, bring him.” Then Ben-Hadad came out to him; and he had him come up into the chariot.","Lu bơngai 'noh mơ̆ng nơ̆r pơtao Ahap pơma 'noh 'lơ̆ng tơpă na lu sư lui hloi, khan: “Ben Hadat 'noh 'nhŏng oh ih tơpă.” Ahap khan dơ̆ng: “Lu iĕm năm iŏk sư tơ âu.” Na 'Ben Hadat năm tơ'bơ̆p Ahap.

"So Ben-Hadad said to him, “The cities which my father took from your father I will restore; and you may set up marketplaces for yourself in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria.” Then Ahab said, “I will send you away with this treaty.” So he made a treaty with him and sent him away.","Ben Hadat khan kơ Ahap: “Inh gô pơdrâu ăn kơ ih dôm lu pơlei mă 'bă inh tơgar iŏk đơ̆ng 'bă ih.

"Now a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbor by the word of the LORD, “Strike me, please.” And the man refused to strike him.","Chu nơ̆r Kră Yang, đei minh 'nu lăm lu bơngai khan lê̆ adrol khan kơ buăl sư: “Apinh ih teh inh,” Mă-lei buăl sư ưh kơ teh sư."
"Then he said to him, “Because you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, surely, as soon as you depart from me, a lion shall kill you.” And as soon as he left him, a lion found him and killed him.","Na sư khan: “Yua kơ ih ưh kơ chu nơ̆r Kră Yang, na lăp ih weh đơ̆ng inh kơnh dăm-brang gô châu pơlôch ih.” Lăp sư weh, đei minh pôm Dăm-brang châu sư lôch hloi."

"Now as the king passed by, he cried out to the king and said, “Your servant went out into the midst of the battle; and there, a man came over and brought a man to me, and said, ‘Guard this man; if by any means he is missing, your life shall be for his life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver.’","Lăp pơtao năm brih trong 'noh sư ôr apinh pơtao: “Đĭch đam ih oei lăm anih tơblah; na đei minh 'nu năm ba kơ inh minh 'nu bơngai bơnă păng khan kơ inh: ‘Ih athei wei bơngai 'nâu; tơdah sư kơdâu klĕnh tơ nai, lei tơdrong arih ih gô tơplih kơ sư 'noh, dah mă ih duh minh talâng hu.’"
"While your servant was busy here and there, he was gone.” Then the king of Israel said to him, “So shall your judgment be; you yourself have decided it.”","Mă-lei kơplah đĭch đam ih oei hăt kơ tơdrong jang 'nâu tơdrong jang to, na bơngai bơnă 'noh kơdâu klĕnh.” Pơtao Isơrael khan kơ sư: “Tơdrong 'noh, kơdih ih gô pŭ iŏk tơdrong sek tơlang.”"
"And he hastened to take the bandage away from his eyes; and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets.","Đơ̆ng noh sư pơih lê̆ che đơ̆ng gom muh măt sư 'noh na pơtao Isơrael kơnăl sư 'noh bơngai khan lê̆ adrol."

"So Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, “Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a vegetable garden, because it is near, next to my house; and for it I will give you a vineyard better than it.

"So Ahab went into his house sullen and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for he had said, “I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.” And he lay down on his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no food.","Ahap mơ̆t tơ lăm hnam jơhngơ̆m ưh kơ hiôk păng sơ'ngon dêh yua kơ nơ̆r Nabôt, bơngai Jêsreel; đei khan kơ pơtao: “Inh ưh kơ gơh ăn kơ ih ôh tơmam đơ̆ng lu 'bok kơdră inh.

"He said to her, “Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, ‘Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it pleases you, I will give you another vineyard for it.’ And he answered, ‘I will not give you my vineyard.’ ”","Sư tơl: “Yua kơ inh khan kơ Nabôt bơngai Jêsreel: ‘Tĕch ăn kơ inh mir hơmu ih 'noh inh gô ăn jên dah mă tơplih băl hăm mir hơmu inh nai kư̆m bưh, mă-lei sư khan: ‘Inh ưh kơ gơh ăn kơ ih mir hơmu inh.’ ”"
"Then Jezebel his wife said to him, “You now exercise authority over Israel!

"And she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and the nobles who were dwelling in the city with Naboth.","Jêsebel chih hla bơar yua hăm anăn pơtao Ahap păng chơ̆m tơdra đơ̆ng pơtao, đơ̆ng noh gơih ăn kơ lu kră pơlei păng lu bơngai đe pơyom oei hơdai hăm pơlei Nabôt."
"She wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and seat Naboth with high honor among the people","Sư chih lăm hla bơar 'noh: “Tơbăt tơtă kơ kon pơlei athei kơ̆m giĕng ơ̆t kơ sŏng sa. Athei ăn kơ Nabôt hơ-oei 'bơ̆t anăp kon pơlei."

"So the men of his city, the elders and nobles who were inhabitants of his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them.","Lu bơngai lăm pơlei, kră pơlei păng lu bơngai mă đe pơyom lăm pơlei pơm kiơ̆ kơ nơ̆r Jêsebel pơkă lăm kơthơ chih gơih ăn kơ lu sư."

"And two men, scoundrels, came in and sat before him; and the scoundrels witnessed against him, against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, “Naboth has blasphemed God and the king!” Then they took him outside the city and stoned him with stones, so that he died.","Đơ̆ng noh ăn 'bar 'nu bơngai hơ-oei 'bơ̆t anăp Nabôt; na jâu sư 'bơ̆t anăp kon pơlei pơla khan: “Nabôt hiap Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei păng hiap pơtao.” Na lu sư dui Nabôt lĕch tơ jih pơlei klơ̆m pơlôch sư păng tơmo."

"And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, “Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.”","Lăp Jêsebel kơtơ̆ng đe roi khan đe klơ̆m pơlôch Nabôt păng tơmo bơih, sư iung hloi năm khan kơ Ahap klo sư: “Iung bĕ, năm iŏk mir hơmu Nabôt Pơlei Jêsreel mir mă đêl sư ưh kơ wă tĕch ăn kơ ih 'noh, yua kơ Nabôt lôch bơih.”"
"So it was, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab got up and went down to take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.","Lăp Ahap kơtơ̆ng khan Nabôt lôch bơih, sư iung năm hloi tơ mir hơmu Nabôt Pơlei Jêsreel păng iŏk hloi mir 'noh jing mir sư kơdih."
"Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying","Đơ̆ng noh đei nơ̆r Kră Yang khan kơ Êli pơlei Tisbit"
"“Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who lives in Samaria.

"You shall speak to him, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD: “Have you murdered and also taken possession?” ’ And you shall speak to him, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD: “In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth, dogs shall lick your blood, even yours.” ’ ”","Ih khan kơ sư: “Kră Yang khan: Hăm trŏ kơ ih pơlôch tơ'ngla sư bơih păng tơgar iŏk mir sư?” Ih kư̆m khan kơ sư: Kră Yang khan: ‘Tơ anih mă kŏ liah bơih pham Nabôt, kŏ kư̆m gô liah pham ih.’ ”"
"So Ahab said to Elijah, “Have you found me, O my enemy?” And he answered, “I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do evil in the sight of the LORD","Ahap khan kơ Êli: “Ơ bơngai ayăt kơ inh, ih rôp tơm măt hă?” Êli tơl: “Inh rôp ih tơm măt boih,” yua kơ ih tĕch akâu ih kơdih wă pơm tơdrong yoch kơnê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang.

"I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, because of the provocation with which you have provoked Me to anger, and made Israel sin.’","Inh gô ăn kơ adrĕch hnam ih đei tơdrong răm truh thoi adrĕch hnam Jêrôbôam, kon drŏ-nglo Nêbat păng thoi adrĕch hnam Baasa kon drŏ-nglo Ahija.’ Yua kơ ih pơm tơblĕk wă kơ inh hil păng pơhlŭ bơngai Isơrael pơm yoch."
"And concerning Jezebel the LORD also spoke, saying, ‘The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.’","Kră Yang kư̆m khan gah Jêsebel: ‘Kŏ gô sa sĕch Jêsebel tơ lăm pơlei Jêsreel.’"
"The dogs shall eat whoever belongs to Ahab and dies in the city, and the birds of the air shall eat whoever dies in the field.”","“Bơngai bu adrĕch hnam Ahap, tơdah sư lôch lăm pơlei, kŏ gô sa, bơngai bu lôch tơ bri brah sem păr gô choh sa.”"
"But there was no one like Ahab who sold himself to do wickedness in the sight of the LORD, because Jezebel his wife stirred him up.","Tơpă, ưh kơ đei bơngai bu thoi Ahap tĕch akâu sư pơm tơdrong yoch kơnê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, kiơ̆ kơ Jêsebel akăn sư pơhlŭ."
"And he behaved very abominably in following idols, according to all that the Amorites had done, whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.","Dôm tơdrong sư pơm kơ Kră Yang areh dêh, sư kơkuh kơ rup yang thoi lu bơngai Amôrit kơkuh, lu sư noh kon pơlei pơla mă Kră Yang pơpuh tơlĕch bơih lu sư đơ̆ng anăp lu bơngai Isơrael."
"So it was, when Ahab heard those words, that he tore his clothes and put sackcloth on his body, and fasted and lay in sackcloth, and went about mourning.","Lăp Ahap kơtơ̆ng nơ̆r pơma noh, sư hek ao sư kơdih. Sư iŏk hrŭk ao 'bi păng ơ̆t kơ sŏng sa; sư 'bĭch kơpal 'bi păng chu iŏk đon ala."
"And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying","Kră Yang khan kơ Êli Pơlei Tisbit"

"Now three years passed without war between Syria and Israel.","Lăm pêng sơnăm Aram păng Isơrael ưh kơ đei tơdrong tơblah."
"Then it came to pass, in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went down to visit the king of Israel.","Mă-lei lăm sơnăm mă pêng, Jêhôsaphat pơtao đe Juđa, jur năm ngôi hơpong tơ pơtao đe Isơrael."
"And the king of Israel said to his servants, “Do you know that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, but we hesitate to take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?”","Pơtao đe Isơrael khan kơ lu bơngai bơ̆jang kơ sư. “Lu iĕm hăm băt ưh pơlei Ramôt Gileat 'noh teh lu bơ̆n, mă-lei lu bơ̆n kư̆m oei hreh ưh kơ đei pơm kiơ, wă pơdrâu iŏk sư đơ̆ng tơpang ti pơtao Aram?”"
"So he said to Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to fight at Ramoth Gilead?” Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.”","Pơtao khan kơ Jêhôsaphat: “Ih hăm wă blah iŏk Pơlei Ramôt Gileat hơdai hăm inh ưh?” Jêhôsaphat tơl pơtao đe Isơrael: Inh kư̆m thoi ih, kon pơlei pơla inh kư̆m thoi kon pơlei pơla ih, aseh inh kư̆m thoi aseh ih mơ̆n.”"

"Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, “Shall I go against Ramoth Gilead to fight, or shall I refrain?” So they said, “Go up, for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.”","Thoi noh na pơtao đe Isơrael krao akŭm đei puăn-hrĕng 'nu lu 'bok khan lê̆ adrol, na jet lu sư: “Inh hăm gơh năm blah pơlei Ramôt Gileat ưh dah lê̆ đĕch?” Lu sư khan: “Gơh mơ̆n, năm blah bĕ, yua kơ Kră Yang gô jao pơlei 'noh lăm tơpang ti ih.”"

"So the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is still one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may inquire of the LORD; but I hate him, because he does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil.” And Jehoshaphat said, “Let not the king say such things!”","Pơtao Isơrael tơl Jêhôsaphat khan: “Đei oei pă minh 'nu anăn sư Mikai kon drŏ-nglo Imla; đơ̆ng sư 'noh bơ̆n gơh krao apinh jet Kră Yang; mă-lei inh areh kơ sư dêh, yua kơ sư ưh kơ khan lê̆ adrol tơdrong 'lơ̆ng gah inh, tă tơdrong kơnê̆ ngăl.” Jêhôsaphat tơl: “Pơtao ih 'nĕ kơ pơma thoi noh.”"

"The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, having put on their robes, sat each on his throne, at a threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.","Kơplah noh pơtao đe Isơrael păng Jêhôsaphat pơtao đe Juđa hrŭk ao pơtao hơ-oei kơpal tang-dŏ pơtao tơ anih đe preh 'ba 'bơ̆t jê̆ 'măng jang Pơlei Samari.

"The LORD said to him, ‘In what way?’ So he said, ‘I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ And the LORD said, ‘You shall persuade him, and also prevail.

"Now Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, “Which way did the spirit from the LORD go from me to speak to you?”","Kơplah noh Sêđekia, kon drŏ-nglo Kênaana, năm jê̆ Mikai, tap tơ'bŏk sư, na khan: “Yang bơhngol Kră Yang lĕch đơ̆ng inh trong ayơ, mă năm khan kơ ih?”"

"So it was, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, “Surely it is the king of Israel!” Therefore they turned aside to fight against him, and Jehoshaphat cried out.","Lăp lu yŏng linh gre aseh 'bôh Jêhôsaphat, lu sư khan: “To pơtao Isơrael tơ âu boih.” Na lu sư năm blah hloi pơtao mă-lei Jêhôsaphat ôr"

"Now a certain man drew a bow at random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of his armor.

"The battle increased that day; and the king was propped up in his chariot, facing the Syrians, and died at evening.

"So the king died, and was brought to Samaria. And they buried the king in Samaria.","Pơtao lôch, na đe chơ ba atâu sư tơ plei Samari 'bŭ sư lăm Pơlei Samari."
"Then someone washed the chariot at a pool in Samaria, and the dogs licked up his blood while the harlots bathed, according to the word of the LORD which He had spoken.","Đe ôp gre aseh pơtao tơ dơnâu đak Samari, anih mă lu drŏ-kăn đi juăt kơ hum păng kŏ liah pham sư tơ noh, trŏ thoi nơ̆r Kră Yang đei khan bơih."

"And the rest of the perverted persons, who remained in the days of his father Asa, he banished from the land.","Dôm tơdrong jang nai Jêhôsaphat pơm, tơdrong pran sư kĕ jei, tơdrong sư tơblah, đe đei chih 'măn lê̆ bơih lăm sơ̆p hla bơar hơ'mon gah lu pơtao Juđa?"
"There was then no king in Edom, only a deputy of the king.","Na sư pơlôch pơđĭ lu bơngai drŏ-nglo đi pơm kư̆ kă đơ̆ng lăm char sư, mă oei đei đơ̆ng chăl Asa, 'bă sư pơgơ̆r."
"Jehoshaphat made merchant ships to go to Ophir for gold; but they never sailed, for the ships were wrecked at Ezion Geber.","Kơplah noh lăm char Eđôm ưh kơ đei pơtao, đei minh 'nu yŏng chă jang tang tơplih pơgơ̆r lu sư."
"Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “Let my servants go with your servants in the ships.” But Jehoshaphat would not.","Jêhôsaphat pơm duk đơ̆ng char Taris wă năm tơ dêh char Ôphir, sư chă maih mă-lei lu sư ưh kơ yĕng kơ năm, yua kơ duk sư pơchah tơ pơlei Êsiôn Gêber."
"And Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David his father. Then Jehoram his son reigned in his place.","Kơplah noh Ahasia kon drŏ-nglo Ahap khan kơ Jêhôsaphat: “Apinh ih song đĭch đam inh tŏk duk năm hơdai hăm đĭch đam ih,” mă-lei Jêhôsaphat ưh kơ ăn."
"Ahaziah the son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel.","Jêhôsaphat lôch năm oei hơdai hăm lu 'bok kơdră sư, đe 'bŭ sư hơdai hăm lu 'bok kơdră sư tơ pơlei Đawit 'bok sư, Jêhôram kon drŏ-nglo sư pơgơ̆r pơtrơp đơ̆ng sư."
"He did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father and in the way of his mother and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin","Lăm sơnăm mă mơjĭt-tơpơh lăm chăl Jêhôsaphat pơm pơtao đe Juđa. Ahasia, kon drŏ-nglo Ahap pơm pơtao Isơrael tơ dêh Samari. Sư pơgơ̆r lăp 'bar sơnăm đĕch."
"for he served Baal and worshiped him, and provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger, according to all that his father had done.","Sư pơm lơ tơdrong yoch kơnê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, kiơ̆ trong 'bă sư păng mĕ sư păng kiơ̆ trong Jêrôbôam kon drŏ-nglo Nêbat, bơngai mă pơhlŭ lu bơngai Isơrael pơm yoch."
"","Sư kơkuh păng bơ̆jang kơ yang Baal, pơm lơ tơdrong kơnê̆ tơblĕk Kră Yang, 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael hil, pơm kiơ̆ thoi trong 'bă sư pơm bơih. 05-Mar-2008@ 23:17, Backup Description=19-Feb-2008@04:51, UYNH - 11-Nov-2014@18:29, Backup Description="
