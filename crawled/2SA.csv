"Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David had returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had stayed two days in Ziklag","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ Sôl lôch, Đawit blah lu bơngai Amalek jei sư đang boih, na sư brŏk oei lăm pơlei Siklak 'bar năr."
"on the third day, behold, it happened that a man came from Saul’s camp with his clothes torn and dust on his head. So it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the ground and prostrated himself.","Năr mă pêng đei minh 'nu bơngai đơ̆ng kơđông Sôl, hơbĕn ao sư hiah đĭ, kơ̆l sư 'bĕnh kơ 'mui teh sư năm 'bơ̆t anăp drap kơkuh kơ Đawit."
"And David said to him, “Where have you come from?” So he said to him, “I have escaped from the camp of Israel.”","Đawit jet sư: “Ih đơ̆ng yơ?” Sư tơl: “Inh đơ̆ng kơđông linh Isơrael kơdâu hlôi tơ âu.”"
"Then David said to him, “How did the matter go? Please tell me.” And he answered, “The people have fled from the battle, many of the people are fallen and dead, and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.”","Đawit jet dơ̆ng: “Đei tơdrong kiơ tơ noh? Ih roi kơ inh.” Sư roi: “Lu bơngai Isơrael tơblah thuơ kơdâu đĭ boih, đei lơ bơngai lôch; Sôl păng kon sư Jônathan, kư̆m lôch mơ̆n.”"
"So David said to the young man who told him, “How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?”","Đawit jet bơngai tơdăm mă roi ei: “Liơ ih băt kơ Sôl păng kon sư Jônathan lôch boih?”"
"Then the young man who told him said, “As I happened by chance to be on Mount Gilboa, there was Saul, leaning on his spear; and indeed the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.","Bơngai tơdăm ei tơl: “Lăp inh năm rok trong kông Gilbôa,” na inh 'bôh Sôl oei 'bĭch hơgrop hăm tơju sư, gre hăm lu linh ayăt druh wă jê̆ sư."
"Now when he looked behind him, he saw me and called to me. And I answered, ‘Here I am.’","Na sư hue lăng 'bôh inh păng krao inh. Inh tơl: “Kiơ inh tơ âu.”"
"And he said to me, ‘Who are you?’ So I answered him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’","Sư jet inh; “ih bu? Inh tơl:” Inh bơngai Amalek."
"He said to me again, ‘Please stand over me and kill me, for anguish has come upon me, but my life still remains in me.’","Sư khan kơ inh: Năm tơ âu jah pơlôch inh đĕch, yua kơ inh pơnĕ pơmat ưh kơ jah lôch."
"So I stood over him and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown that was on his head and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.”","Na inh năm jê̆ pơlôch sư hloi, yua kơ inh băt kơ sư ưh pă gơh arih boih, yua kơ rơka jrŭ dêh, na inh plôh iŏk môk pơtao đơ̆ng kơ̆l sư hăm kong maih đơ̆ng kơkŏng ti sư, na chĕp ba tơ âu ăn kơ ih yŏng inh."
"Therefore David took hold of his own clothes and tore them, and so did all the men who were with him.","Đawit hek hloi ao sư, đĭ-đăng lu bơngai kiơ̆ sư kư̆m pơm thoi noh."
"And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son, for the people of the LORD and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.","Lu sư tŭr kơtơh, nhơ̆m hmoi, hăm ơ̆t kơ sŏng sa truh tơ kơsơ̆, wă wang ơh sơ'ngon kơ Sôl hăm kon sư Jônathan, hăm yua kơ kon pơlei Kră Yang păng adrĕch Isơrael, yua kơ lu bơngai 'nâu pơ̆k lôch lăm anih tơblah."
"Then David said to the young man who told him, “Where are you from?” And he answered, “I am the son of an alien, an Amalekite.”","Đawit jet bơngai tơdăm noh: “Ih bơngai đơ̆ng yơ? Sư tơl:” Inh kon tơdăm bơngai Amalek, oei tơ âu."
"So David said to him, “How was it you were not afraid to put forth your hand to destroy the LORD’s anointed?”","Đawit ôr: “Yua kơ kiơ ih pơ̆n pơlôch bơngai mă đơ̆ng Kră Yang rơih.”"
"Then David called one of the young men and said, “Go near, and execute him!” And he struck him so that he died.","Đawit krao minh 'nu bơngai tơdăm kiơ̆ sư na khan: “Năm pơlôch sư bĕ!” Bơngai ei năm pơlôch sư hloi."
"So David said to him, “Your blood is on your own head, for your own mouth has testified against you, saying, ‘I have killed the LORD’s anointed.’ ”","Đawit khan: “Pham ih tuh plơ̆ kơpal kơ̆l ih! Nơ̆r ih roi kơdih tơdrong noh, yua kơ ih khan: ‘Kơdih inh pơlôch bơngai mă Kră Yang rơih.’ ”"
"Then David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son","Đawit pơm 'bai hơri nhơ̆m hmoi ơh sơ'ngon kơ Sôl păng kon tơdăm sư Jônathan."
"and he told them to teach the children of Judah the Song of the Bow; indeed it is written in the Book of Jasher","Đawit bơtho tơ'blŏk kơ lu kon pơlei bơngai Juđa 'bai hơri hơ'ngon gah Hră jŭk, mă đe gô chih răk lăm sơ̆p hla bơar roi gah Bơngai 'lơ̆ng tơpăt (Jashar)"
"“The beauty of Israel is slain on your high places! How the mighty have fallen!","Ơ bơngai mă iĕm ư-ang, ơ Isơrael Đĭ lôch hiong lăm kông kŏ! Ôi lu bơngai nuih kơtang 'nâu lôch boih."
"Tell it not in Gath, Proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon— Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.","'Nĕ chă roi tơdrong 'nâu tơ lăm pơlei Gat, 'nĕ chă roi tơdrong noh kiơ̆ trong tih pơlei Askalon; kơnh lu bơngai drŏ-kăn Philistin hiĕk chhôk, lu drŏ-kăn bơngai ưh kơ kăt tơdra akar hiôk chơt."
"“O mountains of Gilboa, Let there be no dew nor rain upon you, Nor fields of offerings. For the shield of the mighty is cast away there! The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.","Ơ kông groi Gilbôa Rŏ kơ tŭk gom păng 'mi 'nĕ pă jruh tơ ih, rŏ kơ ưh pă đei chŭn mir, teh mơ̆r 'lơ̆ng tơ anih 'nâu dơ̆ng.

"From the blood of the slain, From the fat of the mighty, The bow of Jonathan did not turn back, And the sword of Saul did not return empty.","Hră jŭk Jônathan ưh kơ đei layơ wơ̆t brŏk, khan huay kơ đei pham bơngai lôch klep, Đao Sôl ưh kơ layơ brŏk hoh. Mă-lei layơ kư̆m đei rơmă lu bơngai nuih kơtang klep."
"“Saul and Jonathan were beloved and pleasant in their lives, And in their death they were not divided; They were swifter than eagles, They were stronger than lions.","Ôi pơtao Sôl hăm Jônathan trŏ kơ 'mêm gĭt tơpă! Mă oei arih truh tơ lôch kư̆m ưh kơ đei achăng băl: Măr sư hơbĕch hloh kơ Klang pran hloh kơ Dăm-brang!"
"“O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, Who clothed you in scarlet, with luxury; Who put ornaments of gold on your apparel.","Ơ lu drŏ-kăn Isơrael, nhơ̆m hmoi bĕ 'mêm kơ Sôl. Sư pơhrŭk ăn kơ iĕm ao che thêt 'lơ̆ng, Pơhrôp pơguăng chô̆ ăn maih tơ ao lu iĕm."
"“How the mighty have fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan was slain in your high places.","Ôi hĭ bơngai nuih kơtang âu pơ̆k tơ anih tơblah. Jônathan lôch tơ anih groi grôn."
"I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan; You have been very pleasant to me; Your love to me was wonderful, Surpassing the love of women.","Ơ Jônathan, 'nhŏng inh, jơhngơ̆m inh ơh hang nuih kơ ih thoi đe 'bet; Inh 'mêm kơeng kơ ih dêh. Tơdrong buăl juăt ba hiôk hơiă dêh Hloh kơ tơdrong hưch wă kơ bơngai drŏ-kăn."
"“How the mighty have fallen, And the weapons of war perished!”","“Ôi hĭ bơngai nuih kơtang đĭ pơ̆k lôch! Tơmam tơblah đĭ pơchah răm.”"
"It happened after this that David inquired of the LORD, saying, “Shall I go up to any of the cities of Judah?” And the LORD said to him, “Go up.” David said, “Where shall I go up?” And He said, “To Hebron.”","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ noh, Đawit krao apinh Kră Yang: Inh hăm gơh năm tơ minh pôm pơlei ayơ lăm dêh Juđa ưh? Kră Yang tơl sư: Năm bĕ. Đawit apinh dơ̆ng: Inh gô năm tơ yơ? Kră Yang tơl: Ih năm tơ Hêbrôn."
"So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite.","Đawit tŏk năm tơ noh hơdai hăm 'bar 'nu akăn sư, Ahinôam đơ̆ng pơlei Jêsreel hăm Abigail, dơ̆ng akăn Nabal pơlei Karmel."
"And David brought up the men who were with him, every man with his household. So they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.","Đawit kư̆m chông ba lu bơngai kiơ̆ sư năm hăm hnam dơnŏ lu sư, năm mơ̆n na chă oei tơ lu pơlei lăm tơring Hêbrôn."
"Then the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, “The men of Jabesh Gilead were the ones who buried Saul.”","Lu bơngai Juđa năm truh tơ Hêbrôn tơ noh na lu sư tuh đak rơmă kơ Đawit pôk sư pơm pơtao bơngai Juđa. Đe năm roi ăn kơ Đawit: “Kon pơlei Jabes Gileat 'bŭ hơmet Sôl.”"
"So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead, and said to them, “You are blessed of the LORD, for you have shown this kindness to your lord, to Saul, and have buried him.","Đawit wơh bơngai năm ngôi hơpong tơ pơlei Jabes lăm tơring Gileat, na khan: “Hơpơi apinh Kră Yang tuh ăn pŭn hiôk kơ lu iĕm, yua kơ lu iĕm pôm đon hăm Sôl yŏng lu iĕm, na iĕm 'bŭ hơmet sư!"
"And now may the LORD show kindness and truth to you. I also will repay you this kindness, because you have done this thing.","Dang ei apinh Kră Yang iŏk tơdrong sĭt 'lơ̆ng tơpăt Sư ăn kơ lu iĕm, gah inh kư̆m bơnê păng pơm 'lơ̆ng kơ lu iĕm, yua kơ lu iĕm đei pơm boih tơdrong noh"
"Now therefore, let your hands be strengthened, and be valiant; for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah has anointed me king over them.”","Hơpơi kơ lu iĕm đei jơhngơ̆m nuih kơtang khŏm tơ'bôh ăn kơ đe iĕm jing bơngai nuih kơtang, yua kơ Sôl yŏng iĕm đĭ lôch boih; păng lu bơngai Juđa đei tuh đak rơmă pôk inh pơm pơtao lu sư.”"
"But Abner the son of Ner, commander of Saul’s army, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim","Kơplah noh Apner, kon drŏ-nglo Nêr yŏng linh Sôl ba Isbôset,a kon tơdăm Sôl, ôn tơ pơlei Mahanaim"
"and he made him king over Gilead, over the Ashurites, over Jezreel, over Ephraim, over Benjamin, and over all Israel.","Apner pôk Isbôset pơm pơtao tơring Gileat, kon pơlei Asuri, tơring Jêsreel, Êphraim, Bênjamin, păng đĭ char Isơrael."
"Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. Only the house of Judah followed David.","Kơplah Isbôset, kon tơdăm Sôl pơtơm pơm pơtao pơgơ̆r Isơrael, sư đei puăn-jĭt sơnăm, sư pơgơ̆r lăm 'bar sơnăm; lăp lu adrĕch Juđa đĕch kiơ̆ Đawit."
"And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.","Đawit oei tơ pơlei Hêbrôn pơgơ̆r lu adrĕch Juđa đei tơpơh sơnăm tơdrâu khei."
"Now Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.","Lăp Apner, kon tơdăm Nêr, hăm lu đĭch đam Isbôset, kon tơdăm Sôl lĕch đơ̆ng pơlei Mahanaim lĕch năm tơ Gibeôn"
"And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out and met them by the pool of Gibeon. So they sat down, one on one side of the pool and the other on the other side of the pool.","Jôap kon tơdăm Sêruia, păng lu đĭch đam Đawit kư̆m dai lĕch; 'bar pah tơ'bơ̆p băl 'bơ̆t dơnâu Gibeôn, na minh khŭl oei pah âu, hăm minh khŭl oei pah to kơ đak dơnâu."
"Then Abner said to Joab, “Let the young men now arise and compete before us.” And Joab said, “Let them arise.”","Apner khan kơ Jôap: “ ‘Bơ̆n lê̆ lu bơngai tơdăm 'nâu iung pơlong băl lăng 'bơ̆t anăp bơ̆n.’ Jôap khan: ‘Lei bĕ lê̆ lu sư pơlong băl.’ ”"
"So they arose and went over by number, twelve from Benjamin, followers of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve from the servants of David.","Na lu sư iung năm hloi, 'bar pah dôm ăi, gah Isbôset, kon tơdăm Sôl, bơngai Bênjamin mơjĭt-'bar 'nu bơngai tơdăm, păng gah Đawit mơjĭt-'bar 'nu tơdăm bơngai Juđa."
"And each one grasped his opponent by the head and thrust his sword in his opponent’s side; so they fell down together. Therefore that place was called the Field of Sharp Swords, which is in Gibeon.","Rim 'nu rôp kơ̆l bơngai mă ayăt, iŏk đao 'bet tơ rơhiĕo, na đĭ-đăng lu sư kư̆m lôch hơdai. Đe krao anih noh anăn Hêlkat Hasurim,b lăm tơmăn glă Gibeôn."
"So there was a very fierce battle that day, and Abner and the men of Israel were beaten before the servants of David.","Lăm minh năr noh tơdrong tơblah băl krưp dêh. Apner hăm lu bơngai Isơrael lu sư thuơ kơ lu linh pơtao Đawit."
"Now the three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab and Abishai and Asahel. And Asahel was as fleet of foot as a wild gazelle.","Tơ noh kư̆m đei pêng 'nu kon tơdăm Sêruia: Noh Jôap, Abisai păng Asahel, Asahel 'nâu sư kơdâu hơbĕch hơbal nhen thoi Keh."
"So Asahel pursued Abner, and in going he did not turn to the right hand or to the left from following Abner.","Sư kơdâu druh 'moi Apner, ưh kơ weh kơ sư, mă khan tơ gah 'ma dah tơ gah 'ngiĕo."
"Then Abner looked behind him and said, “Are you Asahel?” He answered, “I am.”","Apner hue tơ rŏng păng apinh khan: “Hăm trŏ kơ ih Asahel ưh? Sư tơl trŏ boih inh âu.”"
"And Abner said to him, “Turn aside to your right hand or to your left, and lay hold on one of the young men and take his armor for yourself.” But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.","Apner khan kơ sư: “Weh bĕ gah 'ma dah gah 'ngiĕo năm rôp minh 'nu bơngai tơdăm, na iŏk hloi tơmam tơblah đao đơ̆ng sư,” mă-lei Asahel ưh kơ wă weh đơ̆ng druh Apner."
"So Abner said again to Asahel, “Turn aside from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I face your brother Joab?”","Apner khan dơ̆ng kơ Asahel: Athei weh bĕ đơ̆ng inh, yua kơ kiơ ih wă kơ inh pơlôch ih 'bơ̆t dâu? Lei liơ inh gơh lăng muh măt 'nhŏng ih Jôap"
"However, he refused to turn aside. Therefore Abner struck him in the stomach with the blunt end of the spear, so that the spear came out of his back; and he fell down there and died on the spot. So it was that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died, stood still.","Mă-lei Asahel ưh kơ wă weh na Apner iŏk hloi tơju wih rŏng 'bet hloi 'bơ̆t klak klĕch tơ kơdŭ rŏng Asahel pơ̆k lôch kơtă anih. Đĭ-đăng bơngai truh tơ anih Asahel lôch, lu sư dơ̆ng đĭ tơ anih noh."
"Joab and Abishai also pursued Abner. And the sun was going down when they came to the hill of Ammah, which is before Giah by the road to the Wilderness of Gibeon.","Mă-lei Jôap hăm Abisai druh Apner; kơplah măr sư truh tơ groi Amma jê̆ pơlei Giah, 'bơ̆t trong năm tơ tơmăn glă Gibeôn, na 'năr đĭ mơ̆t."
"Now the children of Benjamin gathered together behind Abner and became a unit, and took their stand on top of a hill.","Lu linh bơngai Bênjamin akŭm băl kơjăp tăp dăr kơ Apner; na lu sư dơ̆ng tơ kơpal groi."
"Then Abner called to Joab and said, “Shall the sword devour forever? Do you not know that it will be bitter in the latter end? How long will it be then until you tell the people to return from pursuing their brethren?”","Apner ôr krao Jôap khan: Liơ lê̆ đao hrăn tơ'bet băl hă? E kư̆m băt mơ̆n tuch-luch jing pơmat-tat ngăl đĕch leh kiơ?"
"And Joab said, “As God lives, unless you had spoken, surely then by morning all the people would have given up pursuing their brethren.”","Jôap tơl: Inh pơkă 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Arih ling-lang, tơdah ih ưh kơ pơma lei linh wă druh lu iĕm dĭng truh tơ dơning mă pơdơh."
"So Joab blew a trumpet; and all the people stood still and did not pursue Israel anymore, nor did they fight anymore.","Jôap athei đe hlôm keng, đĭ-đăng linh athei pơdơh, ưh pă druh lu kon pơlei Isơrael, păng ưh pă tơblah băl dơ̆ng."
"Then Abner and his men went on all that night through the plain, crossed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron; and they came to Mahanaim.","Apner hăm lu linh kiơ̆ sư yak prăt măng noh năm rok teh dơnă, tŏk hlôi kơ Krong Jôrđăn tơ jơ̆p kơ Bitrôn, dĭng truh tơ pơlei Mahanaim."
"So Joab returned from pursuing Abner. And when he had gathered all the people together, there were missing of David’s servants nineteen men and Asahel.","Jôap ưh pă druh Apner, na akŭm pơgơ̆p đĭ lu linh wă lăng 'bôh lăm lu đĭch đam Đawit, ưh kơ 'bôh mơjĭt-tơsĭn 'nu akŭm hăm Asahel."
"But the servants of David had struck down, of Benjamin and Abner’s men, three hundred and sixty men who died.","Mă-lei lu linh Đawit đei pơlôch pêng-hrĕng tơdrâu-jĭt 'nu lu bơngai Bênjamin lu linh kiơ̆ jơ̆ng Apner."
"Then they took up Asahel and buried him in his father’s tomb, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at daybreak.","Lu sư tung akâu Asahel, 'bŭ hơdai hăm 'bă sư tơ pơlei Betlehem. Đơ̆ng noh, Jôap hăm lu linh kiơ̆ jơ̆ng sư năm prăt măng dĭng 'brưch pơgê truh tơ pơlei Hêbrôn."
"Now there was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David. But David grew stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker.","Đei tơdrong tơblah đunh tơpă khŭl Đawit hăm khŭl Sôl, gah khŭl Đawit rai đunh rai pran, na gah khŭl Sôl rai đunh rai rơdu tơrăn."
"Sons were born to David in Hebron: His firstborn was Amnon by Ahinoam the Jezreelitess","Tơ Hêbrôn lu akăn Đawit pơjing kon drŏ-nglo ăn kơ pơtao Đawit; kon kơdră sư anăn Amnôn đơ̆ng Ahinôam bơngai Jêsreel tơpŭ ăn."
"his second, Chileab, by Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite; the third, Absalom the son of Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur","Kon mă 'bar sư Kilêap, đơ̆ng Abigail đêl akăn Nabal bơngai Karmel tơpŭ. Kon mă pêng anăn Apsalôm kon drŏ-nglo Maka kon adruh Thamai, pơtao Gêsur."
"the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital","Kon mă puăn Adonija, đơ̆ng yă Hagit, kon drŏ-nglo mă pơđăm anăn Sephatia, kon kă Abitan"
"and the sixth, Ithream, by David’s wife Eglah. These were born to David in Hebron.","păng kon drŏ-nglo mă tơdrâu anăn Itrêam, đơ̆ng yă Egla akăn Đawit. 'Nâu lu kon drŏ-nglo mă Đawit pơjing kơplah sư oei tơ pơlei Hêbrôn."
"Now it was so, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner was strengthening his hold on the house of Saul.","Lăm kơplah khŭl Sôl hăm khŭl Đawit oei tơblah băl, na Apner dŏng gah Sôl."
"And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. So Ishbosheth said to Abner, “Why have you gone in to my father’s concubine?”","Pơtao Sôl đei minh 'nu akăn kơnhŏng, anăn sư Ripba, kon adruh Aiyah. Isbôset kon drŏ-nglo pơtao Sôl chrih kơ Apner khan: Yua kơ kiơ ih năm tơ akăn kơnhŏng 'bă inh?"
"Then Abner became very angry at the words of Ishbosheth, and said, “Am I a dog’s head that belongs to Judah? Today I show loyalty to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David; and you charge me today with a fault concerning this woman?","Apner blĕk hil dêh yua kơ Isbôset pơma, na khan: “Inh âu thoi kŏ kơ bơngai Juđa dah liơ?” Inh oei đĭ jơhngơ̆m kiơ̆ gah khŭl Sôl 'bă ih; 'nhŏng oh, buăl juăt pơtao Sôl truh tơ dang ei. Inh kư̆m ưh kơ wă jao pơtao Sôl lăm ti Đawit, na dang ei pơtao pơma chrih kơ inh khan glăi hăm bơngai drŏ-kăn 'nâu!"
"May God do so to Abner, and more also, if I do not do for David as the LORD has sworn to him","Apinh Kră Yang phak Apner mă trăp, tơdah inh ưh kơ kiơ̆ Đawit pơkeh dôm tơdrong Kră Yang đei pơkă hăm sư."
"to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan to Beersheba.”","Kră Yang đei pơkă khan wă iŏk lê̆ tơdrong pơgơ̆r teh đak đơ̆ng pơtao Sôl, ăn kơ Đawit pơm pơtao pơgơ̆r Isơrael păng Juđa, iŏk đơ̆ng pơlei Đan truh tơ Bêrsêba."
"And he could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.","Isbôset ưh kơ pơ̆n tơl minh nơ̆r hăm Apner yua hli kơ sư."
"Then Abner sent messengers on his behalf to David, saying, “Whose is the land?” saying also, “Make your covenant with me, and indeed my hand shall be with you to bring all Israel to you.”","Apner wơh hloi bơngai năm roi truh tơ Đawit khan dêh char bu âu? Ih athei pơkă pơgơ̆p hăm inh, na inh gô tơgŭm chông ba pơđĭ kon pơlei Isơrael brŏk tơ ih."
"And David said, “Good, I will make a covenant with you. But one thing I require of you: you shall not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul’s daughter, when you come to see my face.”","Đawit tơl: “Ơ, inh gô pơkă pơgơ̆p hăm ih. Inh apinh ih minh tơdrong: Ih ưh kơ gơh năm tơ'bơ̆p inh, ăp kơ ih chông ba Mikal, kon adruh Sôl 'mơ̆i, tơdah ih wă năm tơ'bơ̆p inh.”"
"So David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, saying, “Give me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to myself for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.”","Pơtao Đawit wơh hloi bơngai năm tơ Isbôset kon tơdăm Sôl na khan: Apinh ih pơdrâu Mikal akăn inh mă inh đei oei hăm minh-hrĕng tŏ kơ̆l tơmam drŏ-nglo Philistin."
"And Ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband, from Paltiel the son of Laish.","Na Isbôset wơh bơngai năm iŏk drŏ-kăn noh đơ̆ng hnam klo sư, Phatiêl, kon drŏ-nglo Lais."
"Then her husband went along with her to Bahurim, weeping behind her. So Abner said to him, “Go, return!” And he returned.","Klo sư năm ba yak rah nhơ̆m rah kiơ̆ đơ̆ng rŏng ba truh tơ Bahurim, na Apner khan kơ sư: “Ih brŏk bĕ,” na sư brŏk brăi."
"Now Abner had communicated with the elders of Israel, saying, “In time past you were seeking for David to be king over you.","Apner pơma dơnuh lê̆ adrol hăm lu kră bơngai Isơrael: “Đơ̆ng sơ̆ lu iĕm hơpơi wă kơ Đawit pơm pơtao."
"Now then, do it! For the LORD has spoken of David, saying, ‘By the hand of My servant David, I will save My people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and the hand of all their enemies.’ ”","Na dang ei iĕm athei pơm bĕ; yua kơ Kră Yang đei pơkă hăm Đawit: ‘Inh gô yua Đawit đĭch đam Inh gô dŏng pơklaih adrĕch Isơrael Inh đơ̆ng tơpang ti bơngai Philistin păng đơ̆ng dôm lu bơngai ayăt nai.’ ”"
"And Abner also spoke in the hearing of Benjamin. Then Abner also went to speak in the hearing of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel and the whole house of Benjamin.","Apner kư̆m pơma pơđâu thoi noh hăm lu adrĕch Bênjamin; na sư năm tơ Hêbrôn roi tơbăt ăn kơ Đawit dôm tơdrong mă lu bơngai Isơrael hăm lu bơngai Bênjamin hơpơi."
"So Abner and twenty men with him came to David at Hebron. And David made a feast for Abner and the men who were with him.","Kơplah Apner năm roi kơ Đawit tơ Hêbrôn, sư chông ba 'bar-jĭt 'nu bơngai, na Đawit hơmet tơmam et sa ăn kơ Apner hăm lu bơngai kiơ̆ sư."
"Then Abner said to David, “I will arise and go, and gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your heart desires.” So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.","Đang kơ et sa Apner pơma dơnuh hăm Đawit khan: “Inh gô akŭm pơđĭ lu bơngai Isơrael năm ba brŏk tơ pơtao, lu sư gô pơgơ̆p pơkă pơkăm hăm ih, na ih pơm yŏng pơtao pơgơ̆r đĭ-đăng kơ dêh char Isơrael, thoi kơ ih đei hơpơi.” Đawit ăn kơ Apner brŏk na sư brŏk hiôk-hian."
"At that moment the servants of David and Joab came from a raid and brought much spoil with them. But Abner was not with David in Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.","Kơplah noh, Jôap hăm lu linh Đawit 'nao brŏk đơ̆ng tơblah lu bơngai ayăt, đei chĕp ba lơ tơmam đêl blah iŏk. Kơplah noh Apner ưh pă hơdai hăm Đawit tơ Hêbrôn, yua kơ Đawit đĭ ăn kơ sư brŏk boih, na sư brŏk hiôk-hian."
"When Joab and all the troops that were with him had come, they told Joab, saying, “Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he sent him away, and he has gone in peace.”","Lăp Jôap hăm đĭ-đăng lu linh sư brŏk truh boih, Jôap kơtơ̆ng khan: Apner kon tơdăm Nêr đei năm pơma dơnuh hăm pơtao, pơtao ăn kơ sư brŏk, na lu sư lĕch brŏk hiôk-hian."
"Then Joab came to the king and said, “What have you done? Look, Abner came to you; why is it that you sent him away, and he has already gone?","Jôap năm tơ pơtao na khan: “Pơtao ih pơm kiơ thoi noh? Apner năm tơ'bơ̆p ih, liơ mă ih ăn kơ sư brŏk na sư brŏk hloi boih?"
"Surely you realize that Abner the son of Ner came to deceive you, to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you are doing.”","Pơtao ih băt hloh Apner, kon tơdăm Nêr, sư năm wă hơlĕnh pơdăr kơ ih, wă kơ băt trong ih yak năm, hăm wă kơ chă băt dôm tơdrong jang pơtao pơm.”"
"And when Joab had gone from David’s presence, he sent messengers after Abner, who brought him back from the well of Sirah. But David did not know it.","Đang kơ pơma hăm Đawit Jôap weh, wơh hloi bơngai druh 'moi Apner wă kơ tam druh tam tơ đak sơlŭng Sira, lu sư pơtơm Apner brŏk hơlơ̆k, sơmă Đawit ưh kơ băt."
"Now when Abner had returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him privately, and there stabbed him in the stomach, so that he died for the blood of Asahel his brother.","Lăp Apner brŏk hơlơ̆k truh tơ Hêbrôn, Jôap chông hơdrô̆ Apner weh tơ cheng kơ 'măng dur pơlei, nhen thoi wă pơma dơnuh tơdrong tơduă măr sư, wă 'mong pham đêl Apner pơlôch oh sư Asahel, na 'bet hloi klak, na Apner lôch hloi."
"Afterward, when David heard it, he said, “My kingdom and I are guiltless before the LORD forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ Đawit băt boih, na sư khan: “Inh hăm dêh char pơtao inh ưh kơ đei layơ yoch 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang kơ pham Apner, kon tơdăm Nêr."
"Let it rest on the head of Joab and on all his father’s house; and let there never fail to be in the house of Joab one who has a discharge or is a leper, who leans on a staff or falls by the sword, or who lacks bread.”","Thŭ pham Apner noh tuh tơ kơpal kơ̆l Jôap hăm đĭ-đăng adrĕch 'bă sư păng adrĕch sư ưh kơ đei bu huay kơ đei jĭ krơ, jĭ chin, jopo, mơ'nah lôch kơ đao, mơ'nah tơmam sa ưh mah”"
"So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.","Jôap hăm Abisai 'nhŏng sư, pơlôch Apner, yua kơ Apner pơlôch Asahel, oh măr sư, năr tơblah tơ Gibeôn."
"Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, “Tear your clothes, gird yourselves with sackcloth, and mourn for Abner.” And King David followed the coffin.","Đawit khan kơ Jôap hăm đĭ-đăng kon pơlei kiơ̆ sư tơ noh: “Hek bĕ ao, asu 'bi tơ akâu, na nhơ̆m hmoi kơ Apner;” lu bơngai năm 'bŭ yak adrol kơ hơbang tung Apner, Đawit kiơ̆ đơ̆ng rŏng kơ đe tung Apner."
"So they buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept.","Lăp lu sư 'bŭ Apner đang boih tơ Hêbrôn, na pơtao nhơ̆m hmoi ôr 'bơ̆t bơsat Apner; đĭ-đăng kon pơlei kư̆m wang nhơ̆m hmoi."
"And the king sang a lament over Abner and said: “Should Abner die as a fool dies?","Pơtao hmoi jô̆ hơdrĭ kơ Apner: “Liơ Apner ih lôch thoi bơngai kơhlôh kơwao."
"Your hands were not bound Nor your feet put into fetters; As a man falls before wicked men, so you fell.” Then all the people wept over him again.","Ti ih ưh kơ đei chô̆, jơ̆ng ih kư̆m ưh kơ đei hơnuh.

"And when all the people came to persuade David to eat food while it was still day, David took an oath, saying, “God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread or anything else till the sun goes down!”","Đơ̆ng noh đĭ-đăng lu sư năm jê̆ tơ Đawit, pơlung pơlŭt sư sa 'biơ̆ 'bĕng tŏ sĕt adrol kơ 'năr mơ̆t.

"Now all the people took note of it, and it pleased them, since whatever the king did pleased all the people.","Kon pơlei wang drơ̆ng na lăp đon kơ tơdrong noh, kư̆m thoi lu sư ngăl juăt kơ lăp đon dôm tơdrong kiơ pơtao pơm."
"For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it had not been the king’s intent to kill Abner the son of Ner.","Lăm 'năr noh kon pơlei Isơrael băt kơ pơtao ưh kơ đei athei đe pơlôch Apner, kon tơdăm Nêr."
"Then the king said to his servants, “Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?","Pơtao khan kơ lu đĭch đam sư: “Lu iĕm ưh kơ băt ôh hă 'năr 'nâu, minh 'nu bơngai pơm tih minh 'nu bơngai yŏng mơng lăm lu bơngai Isơrael lôch boih."
"And I am weak today, though anointed king; and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too harsh for me. The LORD shall repay the evildoer according to his wickedness.”","Mă inh 'nâu đei tuh đak rơmă pôk pơm pơtao, mă-lei inh 'bôh inh rơdu tơrăn pơting hăm lu bơngai 'nâu, lu kon drŏ-nglo Sêruia; lu sư pơm kơtang hloh kơ inh Apinh Kră Yang pơm tơwih kơ lu bơngai pơm kơnê̆ 'nâu, kiơ̆ tơdrong kơnê̆ lu sư!”"
"When Saul’s son heard that Abner had died in Hebron, he lost heart, and all Israel was troubled.","Băt kơ Apner lôch boih tơ Hêbrôn, Isbôset kon drŏ-nglo pơtao Sôl jơhngơ̆m sư tơtơ̆ păng đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael rŭng răng hli tơrơ."
"Now Saul’s son had two men who were captains of troops. The name of one was Baanah and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin. (For Beeroth also was part of Benjamin","Pơtao Isbôset kon tơdăm Sôl đei 'bar 'nu yŏng linh, minh 'nu anăn Baanah, minh 'nu anăn Rêkap: Pơđĭ kơ bre sư kon tơdăm Rimmôn đơ̆ng pơlei Bêrôt adrĕch Bênjamin; yua kơ pơlei Bêrôt kư̆m jô̆ pơlei lăm tơring Bênjamin"
"because the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and have been sojourners there until this day.)","Kon pơlei Bêrôt kơdâu ôn đĭ tơ pơlei Gitaim, lu sư oei truh tơ dang ei."
"Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son who was lame in his feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel; and his nurse took him up and fled. And it happened, as she made haste to flee, that he fell and became lame. His name was Mephibosheth.","Jônathan, kon tơdăm Sôl đei minh 'nu kon drŏ-nglo hơwen 'bar pah jơ̆ng.

"Then the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, set out and came at about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who was lying on his bed at noon.","'Bar 'nu kon drŏ-nglo Rimmôn đơ̆ng pơlei Bêrôt, noh Rêkap hăm Baanah kơplah tŏk-bŏk 'năr tŏ. Năm truh tơ hnam Isbôset, sư oei tep pơdơh 'năr dơ̆ng."
"And they came there, all the way into the house, as though to get wheat, and they stabbed him in the stomach. Then Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.","Măr sư mơ̆t hloi lăm hnam, chă pơchĕ khan wă năm iŏk 'ba. Na 'bet hloi 'bơ̆t klak Isbôset. Đơ̆ng noh Rêkap hăm Baanah 'nhŏng sư kơdâu ôn."
"For when they came into the house, he was lying on his bed in his bedroom; then they struck him and killed him, beheaded him and took his head, and were all night escaping through the plain.","Bre sư 'bet pơlôch boih pơtao Isbôset kơplah oei tep kơpal giơng lăm anih tep, chơ̆ng iŏk kơ̆l sư, chĕp ba na năm tơpăt trong dơnă Araba prăt măng."
"And they brought the head of Ishbosheth to David at Hebron, and said to the king, “Here is the head of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul your enemy, who sought your life; and the LORD has avenged my lord the king this day of Saul and his descendants.”","Măr sư chĕp ba kơ̆l Isbôset brŏk tơ Hêbrôn, ăn kơ pơtao Đawit, na khan: “'Nâu kơ̆l Isbôset, kon tơdăm Sôl, bơngai mă ayăt kơ ih, bơngai mă oei chă wă pơrăm ih; năr 'nâu Kră Yang iung kơting ăn kơ ih pơm tơwih boih kơ Sôl păng adrĕch adrung sư.”"
"But David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, “As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my life from all adversity","Đawit tơl bre Rêkap hăm Baanah kon tơdăm Rimmôn pơlei Bêrôt: “Inh pao anăn Kră Yang mă arih ling-lang, Tơ'ngla dŏng inh đơ̆ng dôm tơdrong gleh truh"
"when someone told me, saying, ‘Look, Saul is dead,’ thinking to have brought good news, I arrested him and had him executed in Ziklag—the one who thought I would give him a reward for his news.","Kơplah bơngai năm roi ăn kơ inh khan, Sôl lôch boih, sư tơchĕng khan sư năm roi ăn tơdrong hiôk chơt.

"How much more, when wicked men have killed a righteous person in his own house on his bed? Therefore, shall I not now require his blood at your hand and remove you from the earth?”","Pơma kơ kiơ kơ lu bơngai pơm kơnê̆ pơlôch bơngai 'lơ̆ng oei 'bĭch tep kơpal giơng lăm hnam sư kơdih!

"So David commanded his young men, and they executed them, cut off their hands and feet, and hanged them by the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth and buried it in the tomb of Abner in Hebron.","Đawit athei hloi lu linh sư pơlôch 'bar 'nu bơngai noh, chơ̆ng jơ̆ng ti sư, na hơtol akâu sư jê̆ cheng đak dơnâu tơ Hêbrôn, mă-lei kơ̆l Isbôset lu linh 'bŭ lăm bơsat Apner, tơ Hêbrôn."
"Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and spoke, saying, “Indeed we are your bone and your flesh.","Đĭ-đăng adrĕch Isơrael năm tơ Đawit tơ Hêbrôn, na khan: “Lu nhôn 'nâu jing sĕch akar ih."
"Also, in time past, when Saul was king over us, you were the one who led Israel out and brought them in; and the LORD said to you, ‘You shall shepherd My people Israel, and be ruler over Israel.’ ”","Adrol sơ̆ kơplah Sôl oei pơm pơtao, ih boih pơgơ̆r lu linh Isơrael năm tơblah. ‘Kră Yang đei khan kơ ih’ ‘Ih boih gô wei rong kon pơlei pơla Isơrael Inh, păng pơgơ̆r lu sư.”"
"Therefore all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the LORD. And they anointed David king over Israel.","Đĭ-đăng lu kră bơngai Isơrael năm tơ pơtao Đawit tơ Hêbrôn; pơtao Đawit đei pơm tơdrong pơgơ̆p hăm lu sư tơ Hêbrôn 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, na lu sư tuh đak rơmă pôk Đawit pơm pơtao Isơrael."
"David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.","Kơplah Đawit pơm pơtao, sư 'nao pêng-jĭt sơnăm păng sư pơgơ̆r lăm puăn-jĭt sơnăm."
"In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.","Tơ Hêbrôn, Đawit pơgơ̆r lu bơngai Juđa tơpơh sơnăm tơdrâu khei, păng tơ Jêrusalem, sư pơm pơtao pơgơ̆r đĭ-đăng Isơrael păng Juđa pêng-jĭt pêng sơnăm."
"And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke to David, saying, “You shall not come in here; but the blind and the lame will repel you,” thinking, “David cannot come in here.”","Đawit wang blah pơlei Jêrusalem, lu bơngai Jêbus, oei tơ noh.

"Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion (that is, the City of David).","Mă-lei Đawit kư̆m blah iŏk kơđông Siôn, đe krao plei Đawit."
"Now David said on that day, “Whoever climbs up by way of the water shaft and defeats the Jebusites (the lame and the blind, who are hated by David’s soul), he shall be chief and captain.” Therefore they say, “The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.”","Kơplah noh, Đawit khan: “Dah bơngai bu wă blah bơngai Jêbus, athei mơ̆t rok trong đing đak, blah lu bơngai jơ̆ng jo măt tol lu bơngai mă ayăt hăm Đawit.” Đei nơ̆r khan: “Lu bơngai măt tol jơ̆ng jo ưh kơ gơh mơ̆t tơ hnam pơtao âu.”"
"Then David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the City of David. And David built all around from the Millo and inward.","Đawit oei lăm kơđông anăn kơđông pơlei Đawit. Sư man dur puăn pah đơ̆ng groi Milô năm tơ gah lăm."
"So David went on and became great, and the LORD God of hosts was with him.","Đawit rai đunh rai pran kơtang yua kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Tih Hloh oei hơdai sư."
"Then Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters and masons. And they built David a house.","Hiram pơtao pơlei Tirơ, wơh bơngai năm tơ Đawit, chĕp ba 'long hơngo, chông ba thơ̆ jang 'long, thơ̆ teh tơmo wă man hnam pơtao kơ Đawit."
"So David knew that the LORD had established him as king over Israel, and that He had exalted His kingdom for the sake of His people Israel.","Kơplah noh pơtao Đawit băt boih kơ Kră Yang pôk sư pơm pơtao Isơrael, păng ăn kơ teh đak sư pơgơ̆r đe pơyom yua kơ đei lơi yua kơ kon pơlei Isơrael Sư."
"And David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, after he had come from Hebron. Also more sons and daughters were born to David.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ Đawit lĕch đơ̆ng pơlei Hêbrôn năm tơ pơlei Jêrusalem, sư chă lu akăn tơm păng akăn kơnhŏng dơ̆ng na đei pơjing ăn kơ sư lu kon drŏ-nglo drŏ-kăn dơ̆ng."
"Now these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon","'Nâu anăn lu kon sư tơpŭ lăm pơlei Jêrusalem: Sammua, Sôbap, Nathan, Sôlômôn."
"Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia","Iphar, Êlisua, Nêphek, Japhia"
"Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.","Êlisama, Êliađa, păng Êliphêlet."
"Now when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to search for David. And David heard of it and went down to the stronghold.","Lăp bơngai Philistin băt kơ Đawit đei tuh rơmă pôk pơm pơtao Isơrael boih, na năm chă wă rôp Đawit.

"The Philistines also went and deployed themselves in the Valley of Rephaim.","Kon pơlei Philistin năm gă tơ lăm thŭng Rêphaim."
"So David inquired of the LORD, saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will You deliver them into my hand?” And the LORD said to David, “Go up, for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into your hand.”","Đawit krao apinh Kră Yang: “Inh hăm gơh năm blah bơngai Philistin ưh?

"So David went to Baal Perazim, and David defeated them there; and he said, “The LORD has broken through my enemies before me, like a breakthrough of water.” Therefore he called the name of that place Baal Perazim.","Đawit năm tơ pơlei Baal Phêrasim, 'nâu mă anih tơblah jei sư.

"And they left their images there, and David and his men carried them away.","Bơngai Philistin kơdâu achăng lê̆ lu rup yang lu sư kơtă doh; Đawit hăm lu bơngai kiơ̆ sư iŏk chĕp ba lu rup yang noh."
"Then the Philistines went up once again and deployed themselves in the Valley of Rephaim.","Lu linh bơngai Philistin wơ̆t gă lăm thŭng Rêphaim dơ̆ng."
"Therefore David inquired of the LORD, and He said, “You shall not go up; circle around behind them, and come upon them in front of the mulberry trees.","Đawit krao apinh Kră Yang, Sư tơl: “Ih 'nĕ kơ năm tơpăt, mă-lei athei năm wer đơ̆ng rŏng blah lu sư tơklă kơdrơ̆ng 'long hơngo bri."
"And it shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, then you shall advance quickly. For then the LORD will go out before you to strike the camp of the Philistines.”","'Bơ̆t kơplah mă ih kơtơ̆ng jơ̆ng yak lăm kơdrơ̆ng 'long hơngo bri ih athei năm blah hloi, yua kơ 'bơ̆t kơplah noh Kră Yang năm adrol kơ ih blah lu linh Philistin.”"
"And David did so, as the LORD commanded him; and he drove back the Philistines from Geba as far as Gezer.","Đawit kiơ̆ tôm tơdrong Kră Yang bơtho pơkă kơ sư; sư blah druh bơngai Philistin đơ̆ng Gibeôn truh tơ Geser."
"Again David gathered all the choice men of Israel, thirty thousand.","Đawit akŭm đĭ-đăng lu linh nuih kơtang đei rơih iŏk đơ̆ng lăm bơngai Isơrael. Pêng-jĭt rơbâu 'nu."
"And David arose and went with all the people who were with him from Baale Judah to bring up from there the ark of God, whose name is called by the Name, the LORD of Hosts, who dwells between the cherubim.","Sư păng đĭ-đăng lu bơngai kiơ̆ truh tơ pơlei Baala dêh Juđa wă năm tung iŏk Hom pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei; Hom noh kon pơlei krao anăn Kră Yang Tih Hloh, Kră Yang mă dan tang-dŏ Sư kơpal rim kơ chêrubim kơpal tơnglơ̆p Hom pơgơ̆p."
"So they set the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill; and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.","Lu sư tah Hom pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei kơpal gre 'nao, iŏk đơ̆ng hnam Abinađap oei kơpal groi.

"And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill, accompanying the ark of God; and Ahio went before the ark.","Usa năm rok cheng Hom pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei gah Ahiô năm adrol. Lu sư anhăk Hom pơgơ̆p đơ̆ng hnam Abinađap oei kơpal groi."
"Then David and all the house of Israel played music before the LORD on all kinds of instruments of fir wood, on harps, on stringed instruments, on tambourines, on sistrums, and on cymbals.","Đawit hăm đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael hơri ư-ang 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang hăm dôm tơmam brŏ reh pơm păng 'long dơnơ̆ng, thoi brŏ tĭng-nĭng, hơgơ̆r iĕ chhar, huan lak."
"And when they came to Nachon’s threshing floor, Uzzah put out his hand to the ark of God and took hold of it, for the oxen stumbled.","Lăp truh tơ cham pơjuă 'ba Nakôn, Usa chro ti rôp Hom pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei, yua kơ rơmo kơtơih."
"Then the anger of the LORD was aroused against Uzzah, and God struck him there for his error; and he died there by the ark of God.","Kră Yang hil dêh kơ Usa, yua kơ sư rôp pel 'bơm Hom pơgơ̆p noh; Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei pơlôch hloi sư 'bơ̆t anih 'noh 'bơ̆t cheng Hom pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei."
"And David became angry because of the LORD’s outbreak against Uzzah; and he called the name of the place Perez Uzzah to this day.","Đawit sơ'ngon dêh, yua kơ Kră Yang pơlôch Usa, na sư krao anih 'noh Pêres-Usa, anăn 'nâu oei truh tơ dang ei."
"David was afraid of the LORD that day; and he said, “How can the ark of the LORD come to me?”","Lăm năr 'noh, Đawit hli kơ Kră Yang na pơma khan: “Hom pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei liơ mă inh pơ̆n iŏk lê̆ tơ inh âu?”"
"So David would not move the ark of the LORD with him into the City of David; but David took it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.","Thoi noh Đawit ưh kơ wă lê̆ Hom pơgơ̆p Kră Yang tơ hnam sư tơ pơlei Đawit, na athei anhăk ba hloi tơ hnam Ôbêt Eđôm, bơngai Gitit."
"The ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite three months. And the LORD blessed Obed-Edom and all his household.","Hom pơgơ̆p Kră Yang oei pêng khei lăm hnam Ôbêt Eđôm, bơngai Gitit na Kră Yang tuh ăn pŭn hiôk kơ Ôbêt Eđôm păng đĭ hnam dơnŏ sư."
"Now it was told King David, saying, “The LORD has blessed the house of Obed-Edom and all that belongs to him, because of the ark of God.” So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom to the City of David with gladness.","Đe năm roi ăn kơ pơtao Đawit: “Kră Yang đei tuh pŭn hiôk kơ hnam dơnŏ Ôbêt Eđôm păng dôm tơmam sư đei, yua kơ Hom pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei.” Đawit hloi năm iŏk anhăk hloi Hom pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei đơ̆ng hnam Ôbêt Eđôm ba tơ pơlei Đawit hăm tơdrong chơt hiôk dêh."
"And so it was, when those bearing the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, that he sacrificed oxen and fatted sheep.","Lăp lu bơngai tung Hom pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei năm tơdrâu yak na Đawit pơyơ̆r minh pôm rơmo tơno păng rơmo kon bek pơm tơmam soi."
"Then David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was wearing a linen ephod.","Wă hơri bơnê kơ Kră Yang, Đawit iŏk hrŭk ao êphot, na suang đĭ jơhngơ̆m chơt hiôk."
"So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet.","Kơplah Đawit păng đĭ kon pơlei Isơrael tung anhăk ba Hom pơgơ̆p Kră Yang nơ̆r jreo tơkĕch hiôk chơt păng hlôm keng."
"Now as the ark of the LORD came into the City of David, Michal, Saul’s daughter, looked through a window and saw King David leaping and whirling before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.","Lăp Hom pơgơ̆p Kră Yang mơ̆t tơ pơlei Đawit, na Mikal kon adruh Sôl, lăng tơmang đơ̆ng 'măng-'mŏk, 'bôh Đawit suang chơt hiôk 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, na sư đei jơhngơ̆m ưh kơ iă kơ Đawit."
"So they brought the ark of the LORD, and set it in its place in the midst of the tabernacle that David had erected for it. Then David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.","Lu sư ba Hom pơgơ̆p Kră Yang ming tơ anih bơsŭn Đawit đei hơmet lê̆ boih anih kơ Hom pơgơ̆p; đơ̆ng noh Đawit pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'buh pơkhôi kơ Kră Yang păng tơmam soi et sa chơt hiôk."
"And when David had finished offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.","Kơplah Đawit pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'buh pơkhôi păng tơmam soi et sa chơt hiôk, na sư yua anăn Kră Yang Tih Hloh tuh ăn pŭn hiôk kơ kon pơlei"
"Then he distributed among all the people, among the whole multitude of Israel, both the women and the men, to everyone a loaf of bread, a piece of meat, and a cake of raisins. So all the people departed, everyone to his house.","Sư asong kơ đĭ-đăng kon pơlei Isơrael, lu tơpôl lăm Isơrael mă drŏ-nglo dah drŏ-kăn, minh 'nu minh pôm 'bĕng mi minh kơnăt 'nhĕm phang, hăm minh tơpei 'bĕng hơmu kro, đơ̆ng noh, đĭ-đăng lu sư brŏk tơ hnam sư kơdih."
"Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, “How glorious was the king of Israel today, uncovering himself today in the eyes of the maids of his servants, as one of the base fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!”","Đawit kư̆m dai brŏk wă sơkat pŭn hiôk kơ hnam dơnŏ sư kơdih; mă-lei Mikal kon adruh Sôl, năm sơng Đawit, na khan: “Năr 'nâu pơtao đe Isơrael pơm kơdih akâu wă kơ đei ư-ang, mah suang akâu hoh 'bơ̆t anăp lu đam drŏ-kăn sư, pơm thoi bơngai ưh kơ rơ-a kiơ!”"
"So David said to Michal, “It was before the LORD, who chose me instead of your father and all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel. Therefore I will play music before the LORD.","Đawit tơl khan: “Inh suang wă ư-ang kơ Kră Yang Tơ'ngla mă rơih iŏk inh ưh kơ rơih 'bă ih păng đĭ kơ adrĕch sư, Sư pôk inh pơm pơtao kon pơlei Isơrael, jing kon pơlei Kră Yang, lei na inh suang chơt hiôk wă ư-ang kơ Kră Yang.”"
"And I will be even more undignified than this, and will be humble in my own sight. But as for the maidservants of whom you have spoken, by them I will be held in honor.”","Wă kơ đe lăng inh jing bơngai lŭch hloh; inh gô tơjur akâu inh hloh kơ noh dơ̆ng, mă lu bơngai drŏ-kăn awih awăn gô jing pôk pơyom kơ inh hloh."
"Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no children to the day of her death.","Thoi noh, Mikal; kon adruh Sôl, ưh kơ đei pơjing hơ'lơ̆p ôh truh tơ sư lôch."
"Now it came to pass when the king was dwelling in his house, and the LORD had given him rest from all his enemies all around","Kơplah pơtao oei lăm hnam pơtao sư, păng Kră Yang ăn kơ sư pơdơh hiôk huay pă đei ayăt jum dăr kơ sư"

"But it happened that night that the word of the LORD came to Nathan, saying","Mă-lei lăm măng noh hloi, đei nơ̆r Kră Yang khan kơ Nathan"

"For I have not dwelt in a house since the time that I brought the children of Israel up from Egypt, even to this day, but have moved about in a tent and in a tabernacle.","Đơ̆ng năr Inh anhăk kon pơlei Isơrael lĕch đơ̆ng dêh Êyiptơ truh tơ dang ei, Inh ưh kơ đei oei tơ lăm hnam ayơ, mă-lei kơplah chă năm tơ âu tơ noh Inh oei lăm bơsŭn đĕch."

"Moreover I will appoint a place for My people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own and move no more; nor shall the sons of wickedness oppress them anymore, as previously","Inh gô ăn kơ kon pơlei Isơrael Inh minh anih oei, Inh gô ăn kơ sư chăt rơh lăm anih noh, ăn kơ lu sư oei kơjăp tơ anih noh, huay pă đei hli kơ kiơ dơ̆ng, păng lu bơngai kơnê̆ ưh pă gơh pơjuă pơđep thoi sơ̆ dơ̆ng."

"According to all these words and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.","Nathan bơngai khan lê̆ adrol năm roi ăn kơ Đawit dôm nơ̆r Kră Yang pơma lăm tơdrong tơ'bôh kơ sư."
"Then King David went in and sat before the LORD; and he said: “Who am I, O Lord GOD? And what is my house, that You have brought me this far?","Đơ̆ng noh Pơtao Đawit năm hloi lăm bơsŭn 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang păng khan: “Kơkuh kơ ih Kră Yang inh, inh âu bu, hnam dơnŏ inh kiơ mă Ih đei ba inh truh tơ tơdrong jang 'nâu?"
"And yet this was a small thing in Your sight, O Lord GOD; and You have also spoken of Your servant’s house for a great while to come.

"And who is like Your people, like Israel, the one nation on the earth whom God went to redeem for Himself as a people, to make for Himself a name—and to do for Yourself great and awesome deeds for Your land—before Your people whom You redeemed for Yourself from Egypt, the nations, and their gods?","Tơ jơ̆p lăm teh đak hăm đei adrĕch ayơ nhen thoi adrĕch Isơrael Ih, lăp minh pôm adrĕch đĕch lăm teh âu mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei dŏng pơklaih wă pơm kon pơlei pơla Ih.

"After this it came to pass that David attacked the Philistines and subdued them.

"Then he defeated Moab. Forcing them down to the ground, he measured them off with a line. With two lines he measured off those to be put to death, and with one full line those to be kept alive. So the Moabites became David’s servants, and brought tribute.","Sư kư̆m blah bơngai Môap jei sư, rôp athei lu sư 'bĭch sap tơ teh na iŏk tơlei pơtŏ, mưh 'bar jăl tơlei pơlôch, minh jăl tơlei ăn arih, thoi noh bơngai Môap athei chu jang păng ăn thuê̆ kơ Đawit."

"So David said to him, “Do not fear, for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father’s sake, and will restore to you all the land of Saul your grandfather; and you shall eat bread at my table continually.”","Đawit khan kơ sư: Mon 'nĕ kơ hli, inh wă tơgŭm ih yua kơ đơ̆ng Jônathan 'bă ih, inh gô pơdrâu kơ ih dôm mă bri seh teh choh đơ̆ng 'bok Sôl ih, păng ih gô oei sŏng sa hơdai inh minh pôm gơ'bang ling-lang hlŏng hloi."
"Then he bowed himself, and said, “What is your servant, that you should look upon such a dead dog as I?”","Mêphibôset drap tơ teh kơkuh, na sư pơma khan: “Bơngai đĭch đam ih 'nâu kiơ, mă ih oei tơchĕng 'blŏk 'blăi inh âu thoi minh pôm kŏ lôch?”"
"And the king called to Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said to him, “I have given to your master’s son all that belonged to Saul and to all his house.","Pơtao krao hloi Siba, đĭch đam Sôl, sư khan: Đĭ-đăng mŭk tơmam gah Sôl păng hnam dơnŏ sư. Inh ăn boih kơ sâu tơnơm yŏng tơ'ngla ih."
"You therefore, and your sons and your servants, shall work the land for him, and you shall bring in the harvest, that your master’s son may have food to eat. But Mephibosheth your master’s son shall eat bread at my table always.” Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.","Thoi noh ih hăm lu kon drŏ-nglo păng đĭch đam ih athei choh pơtăm teh mir noh ăn kơ sư, đei plei phe 'ba na yua iŏk 'me hnam dơnŏ yŏng tơ'ngla ih, mă-lei gah Mêphibôset sư gô oei sŏng sa hơdai inh pôm gơ'bang hlŏng hloi boih.

"Then Ziba said to the king, “According to all that my lord the king has commanded his servant, so will your servant do.” “As for Mephibosheth,” said the king, “he shall eat at my table like one of the king’s sons.”","Siba drơ̆ng khan: Đĭch đam ih gô pơm kiơ̆ tôm tơdrong đơ̆ng yŏng pơtao inh pơkă khan.

"Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Micha. And all who dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants of Mephibosheth.","Mêphibôset đei minh 'nu kon drŏ-nglo 'lơ̆p, anăn sư Mika; păng đĭ-đăng lu bơngai oei lăm hnam Siba jing đĭch đam Mephibôset ngăl."
"So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem, for he ate continually at the king’s table. And he was lame in both his feet.","Thoi noh Mêphibôset oei tơ pơlei Jêrusalem, yua kơ sư sŏng sa hơdai pơtao minh gơ'bang ling-lang, mă sư hơwen hơwo 'bar pah jơ̆ng ră."
"It happened after this that the king of the people of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his place.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ pơtao bơngai Ammôn lôch, na Hanun kon drŏ-nglo sư pơgơ̆r, pơtrơp sư."
"Then David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent by the hand of his servants to comfort him concerning his father. And David’s servants came into the land of the people of Ammon.","Đawit khan: “Inh 'maih pơm hiôk hăm Hanun, kon drŏ-nglo Nabas, kư̆m thoi 'bă sư hlôi pơm 'lơ̆ng kơ inh boih” Đawit wơh đĭch đam sư năm ngôi pơlung pơtao Hanun gah tơdrong 'bă sư lôch. Lu đĭch đam Đawit năm truh tơ lăm dêh char kon pơlei Ammôn."
"And the princes of the people of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, “Do you think that David really honors your father because he has sent comforters to you? Has David not rather sent his servants to you to search the city, to spy it out, and to overthrow it?”","Mă-lei lu yŏng wei-lăng kon pơlei Ammôn roi kơ yŏng tơ'ngla sư pơtao Hanun: “Ih tơchĕng khan Đawit wơh lu bơngai năm ngôi pơlung ih yua kơ lu sư pơyom kơ 'bă ih hă?

"Therefore Hanun took David’s servants, shaved off half of their beards, cut off their garments in the middle, at their buttocks, and sent them away.","Pơtao Hanun athei đe rôp lu đĭch đam Đawit, na hơkôih lê̆ sŏk kang lu sư minh pah tơ'bŏk, kăt lê̆ minh pah hơbĕn ao lu sư gah pơtâu, na ăn kơ lu sư brŏk."
"When they told David, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, “Wait at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return.”","Đawit kơtơ̆ng tơdrong ei, na sư wơh lu bơngai năm sơng lu đe ei, yua kơ lu sư mơn mơlâu dêh, pơtao pơkă kơ lu sư: “Lu iĕm oei tơ pơlei Jêrikô dĭng truh tơ sŏk kang lu iĕm chăt 'mơ̆i; na lu iĕm wih brŏk.”"
"When the people of Ammon saw that they had made themselves repulsive to David, the people of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth Rehob and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand foot soldiers; and from the king of Maacah one thousand men, and from Ish-Tob twelve thousand men.","Kon pơlei Ammôn băt kơ lu sư pơm wă kơ Đawit blĕk, na wơh bơngai năm mưng iŏk kon pơlei Siri oei tơ pơlei Bêtrêhot păng tơ Sôba dang 'bar-jĭt rơbâu 'nu linh, na mưng iŏk đơ̆ng pơtao Maaka minh-rơbâu 'nu linh, păng mơjĭt-'bar rơbâu 'nu bơngai đơ̆ng pơlei Top."
"Now when David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the army of the mighty men.","Đawit kơtơ̆ng tơdrong noh, na wơh hloi Jôap yŏng linh hăm lu bơngai linh nuih kơtang sư năm tơblah."
"Then the people of Ammon came out and put themselves in battle array at the entrance of the gate. And the Syrians of Zoba, Beth Rehob, Ish-Tob, and Maacah were by themselves in the field.","Khŭl linh Ammôn lĕch dă 'bơ̆t trong wă mơ̆t tơ pơlei tih, gah lu linh Siri dă 'bơ̆t Sôba păng oei tơ Rêhôp, lu linh oei tơ pơlei Top păng oei tơ Maaka lu sư dă kơdih pha tơ bri tơ tơmăn glă."
"When Joab saw that the battle line was against him before and behind, he chose some of Israel’s best and put them in battle array against the Syrians.","Wă Jôap yŏng linh 'bôh lu linh ayăt wă blah 'bar pah gah anăp gah rŏng kơ lu sư, na sư rơih lu linh nuih kơtang lăm lu bơngai Isơrael săp dă năm tơblah lu linh bơngai Siri."
"And the rest of the people he put under the command of Abishai his brother, that he might set them in battle array against the people of Ammon.","Gah lu linh mă oei oei, sư pơjao ăn kơ Abisai oh sư, săp dă năm tơblah hăm lu linh Ammôn."
"Then he said, “If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the people of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will come and help you.","Sư khan kơ Abisai: “Tơdah lu linh Siri pran hloh kơ inh, ih gô năm tơgŭm inh, mă-lei tơdah lu linh Ammôn pran hloh kơ ih, inh gô năm tơgŭm ih.”"
"Be of good courage, and let us be strong for our people and for the cities of our God. And may the LORD do what is good in His sight.”","'Nĕ kơ hli athei tơblah mă nuih đĭ jơhngơ̆m wă wei kon pơlei pơla bơ̆n, păng lu pơlei tih Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei bơ̆n; hơpơi kơ Kră Yang pơm kiơ̆ thoi Sư tơchĕng 'lơ̆ng!"
"So Joab and the people who were with him drew near for the battle against the Syrians, and they fled before him.","Jôap hăm lu linh kiơ̆ sư năm tơblah hăm lu linh Siri, lu linh Siri thuơ chă kơdâu ôn."
"When the people of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fleeing, they also fled before Abishai, and entered the city. So Joab returned from the people of Ammon and went to Jerusalem.","Wă lu linh Ammôn 'bôh lu linh Siri kơdâu, na lu sư kư̆m kơdâu weh 'bơ̆t anăp Abisai, păng mơ̆t ôn lăm pơlei.

"When the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they gathered together.","Lu linh Siri 'bôh sư blah jei lu linh bơngai Isơrael, na pơtơm akŭm pơpôi băl dơ̆ng."
"Then Hadadezer sent and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the River, and they came to Helam. And Shobach the commander of Hadadezer’s army went before them.","Pơtao Hadadêser wơh bơngai năm akŭm linh Siri mă oei tơ pah to Krong Ơphrat; lu sư năm truh tơ pơlei Hêlam, đei Sobak pơm yŏng linh pơgơ̆r linh Hadadêser."
"When it was told David, he gathered all Israel, crossed over the Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in battle array against David and fought with him.","Kơtơ̆ng tơdrong 'nâu, Đawit akŭm pơpôi dơ̆ng đĭ-đăng lu linh bơngai Isơrael năm tŏk hlôi kơ đak Krong Jôrđăn, năm truh tơ Hêlam, tơ noh lu linh Siri săp dă wă tơblah hăm pơtao Đawit păng lu linh Siri tơblah hloi."
"Then the Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed seven hundred charioteers and forty thousand horsemen of the Syrians, and struck Shobach the commander of their army, who died there.","Mă-lei lu linh Siri thuơ kơdâu đơ̆ng anăp lu linh Isơrael, Đawit pơlôch lu linh Siri pơrăm tơpơh-hrĕng tŏ gre aseh, păng puăn-jĭt rơbâu 'nu lu linh bơngai Siri.

"And when all the kings who were servants to Hadadezer saw that they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with Israel and served them. So the Syrians were afraid to help the people of Ammon anymore.","Na đĭ-đăng lu pơtao kiơ̆ pơtao Hadadêser 'bôh khŭl linh Siri thuơ kơ lu linh bơngai Isơrael, na lu sư apinh lung pơm hiôk hăm lu bơngai Isơrael păng mơ̆t khŭl lu bơngai Isơrael. Lu linh Siri pă pơ̆n dŏng lu kon pơlei Ammôn dơ̆ng."
"It happened in the spring of the year, at the time when kings go out to battle, that David sent Joab and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the people of Ammon and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem.","Lăm bơyan puih lu pơtao juăt kơ năm tơblah, Đawit wơh Jôap hăm lu đĭch đam sư păng đĭ-đăng lu linh bơngai Isơrael năm tơblah; lu sư tơgar iŏk dêh kon pơlei Ammôn păng wang tăp kơ pơlei Rapba. Gah pơtao Đawit oei lăm pơlei Jêrusalem."
"Then it happened one evening that David arose from his bed and walked on the roof of the king’s house. And from the roof he saw a woman bathing, and the woman was very beautiful to behold.","Lăm minh kơsơ̆ ei Đawit iung đơ̆ng tep pơdơh 'năr dơ̆ng sư chă ngôi dăr tơ kơpal bơbŭng hnam pơtao na 'bôh minh 'nu bơngai drŏ-kăn oei hum, bơngai drŏ-kăn ei 'lơ̆ng hơbŏ dêh."
"So David sent and inquired about the woman. And someone said, “Is this not Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?”","Đawit wơh bơngai năm jet bơngai drŏ-kăn ei, na đe khan: “Noh Batsêba, kon drŏ-kăn Êliam, akăn Uri, bơngai Hêtit.”"
"Then David sent messengers, and took her; and she came to him, and he lay with her, for she was cleansed from her impurity; and she returned to her house.","Đawit wơh bơngai năm krao iŏk sư; sư 'nao 'nhao ôp rơgoh tơdrong sư 'bôh jơ̆ng; sư năm truh tơ hnam pơtao, na pơtao tep hơdai hăm sư, đơ̆ng noh sư wih tơ hnam."
"And the woman conceived; so she sent and told David, and said, “I am with child.”","Bơngai drŏ-kăn 'nâu sư anăp, sư wơh bơngai năm roi kơ Đawit khan: “Inh anăp boih.”"
"Then David sent to Joab, saying, “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” And Joab sent Uriah to David.","Đawit wơh năm khan kơ Jôap: “Athei Uri, bơngai Hêtit năm tơ'bơ̆p inh.” Na, Jôap athei Uri năm tơ'bơ̆p Đawit."
"When Uriah had come to him, David asked how Joab was doing, and how the people were doing, and how the war prospered.","Uri năm truh tơ Đawit, Đawit jet gia gah Jôap yŏng linh hăm oei liĕm akâu, bĕ lu linh hăm oei hiôk hơđơ̆ng păng tơdrong tơblah thoi yơ."
"And David said to Uriah, “Go down to your house and wash your feet.” So Uriah departed from the king’s house, and a gift of food from the king followed him.","Na Đawit pơma dơnuh hăm Uri: “Năm wih brŏk bĕ tơ hnam ih, păng ôp hơrao jơ̆ng ih.” Na, Uri lĕch đơ̆ng hnam pơtao, pơtao wơh minh 'nu bơngai chĕp ba kơ sư tơmam đơ̆ng hnam pơtao ăn."
"But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house.","Mă-lei, Uri ưh kơ brŏk tơ hnam, sư tep 'bơ̆t 'măng jang hnam pơtao hơdai hăm lu đĭch đam gak pơtao."
"So when they told David, saying, “Uriah did not go down to his house,” David said to Uriah, “Did you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?”","Đe roi ăn kơ Đawit băt: “Uri ưh kơ brŏk tơ hnam sư.” Đawit jet Uri: “Liơ ih ưh kơ brŏk tơ hnam, yua kơ ih 'nao brŏk đơ̆ng trong ataih.”"
"And Uriah said to David, “The ark and Israel and Judah are dwelling in tents, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are encamped in the open fields. Shall I then go to my house to eat and drink, and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing.”","Uri tơl Đawit: “Hom pơgơ̆p lu linh Isơrael păng Juđa oei tơ lăm bơsŭn, Jôap yŏng tơ'ngla inh, hăm lu đĭch đam oei tơ bri, na inh wă brŏk tơ hnam sŏng sa păng tep hơdai păng akăn inh hă? Inh pơkă hăm ih, inh ưh kơ gơh pơm minh tơdrong thoi noh”"
"Then David said to Uriah, “Wait here today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart.” So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next.","Đawit khan: “Ih oei tơ âu năr 'nâu dơ̆ng, dơning ih brŏk.” Na Uri oei tơ pơlei Jêrusalem lăm năr ei păng năr đơ̆ng rŏng."
"Now when David called him, he ate and drank before him; and he made him drunk. And at evening he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but he did not go down to his house.","Đơ̆ng noh Đawit wơ̆n sư sŏng sa, ăn kơ sư huch tơdrô mă suai; mă-lei truh kơmăng noh Uri năm tep tơ hơkok sư hăm lu đĭch đam gak pơtao, kư̆m ưh kơ brŏk tơ hnam sư."
"In the morning it happened that David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah.","Pơgê đơ̆ng rŏng, Đawit chih minh hlak hla bơar kơthơ ăn kơ Uri chĕp ba kơ Jôap."
"And he wrote in the letter, saying, “Set Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retreat from him, that he may be struck down and die.”","Lăm kơthơ sư chih thoi âu: “Dan bĕ Uri yak adrol lăm năr tơblah tih, na lu iĕm kơdŭn ataih đơ̆ng sư, wă kơ sư rơka na lôch.”"
"So it was, while Joab besieged the city, that he assigned Uriah to a place where he knew there were valiant men.","Kơplah wang tăp pơlei na Jôap dan Uri 'bơ̆t tơklă anih lu linh ayăt pran kơtang."
"Then the men of the city came out and fought with Joab. And some of the people of the servants of David fell; and Uriah the Hittite died also.","Lu linh đơ̆ng lăm pơlei lĕch blah linh Jôap, đei lu mơ'nah bơngai lăm khŭl đĭch đam Đawit lôch, Uri bơngai Hêtit kư̆m dai lôch."
"Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war","Jôap wơh bơngai năm roi kơ Đawit băt dôm tơdrong tơblah."
"and charged the messenger, saying, “When you have finished telling the matters of the war to the king","Sư pơkă ăn kơ bơngai năm roi: “Mưh ih roi ăn dôm tơdrong đei truh kơ pơtao đang boih lăm anih tơblah"
"if it happens that the king’s wrath rises, and he says to you: ‘Why did you approach so near to the city when you fought? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall?","tơdah pơtao pơma khan kơ ih: ‘Yua kơ kiơ lu iĕm năm wang blah jê̆ dur thoi noh? Lu iĕm ưh kơ băt hă, đe oei tơ kơpal dur pơlei kơjung prah iĕm?"
"Who struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Was it not a woman who cast a piece of a millstone on him from the wall, so that he died in Thebez? Why did you go near the wall?’—then you shall say, ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.’ ”","Bu pơlôch Abimêlek kon drŏ-nglo Jêrup Bêset?

Na ih gô tơl sư thoi âu: ‘Uri bơngai Hêtit sư kư̆m lôch.’ ”"
"So the messenger went, and came and told David all that Joab had sent by him.","Bơngai linh sư wơh noh năm; sư truh tơ anih, roi ăn kơ Đawit băt dôm tơdrong Jôap đei pơkă kơ sư.”"
"And the messenger said to David, “Surely the men prevailed against us and came out to us in the field; then we drove them back as far as the entrance of the gate.","Sư roi ăn kơ pơtao Đawit: “Blŭng-a lu linh ayăt pran hloh kơ lu nhôn, lĕch blah lu nhôn tơ bri 'nguaih; na lu nhôn blah druh lu sư truh tơ 'măng jang pơlei."
"The archers shot from the wall at your servants; and some of the king’s servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.”","Lu linh sư chĕp hră dơ̆ng kơpal dur pơlei kơjung sư prah lu đĭch đam ih, đei mơ'nah bơngai lôch hloi; Uri bơngai Hêtit, đĭch đam ih kư̆m dai lôch.”"
"Then David said to the messenger, “Thus you shall say to Joab: ‘Do not let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Strengthen your attack against the city, and overthrow it.’ So encourage him.”","Pơtao Đawit khan kơ bơngai năm roi noh: Ih athei roi kơ Jôap: 'Nĕ kơ mah sơ'ngon dêh kơ dôm tơdrong noh; đao gưm 'bơ̆t lăp pơlôch bơngai 'nâu, pơlôch bơngai to, ih athei khan kơ sư adrin tơblah năm tơ anăp păng pơrăm đĭ pơlei."
"When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.","Akăn Uri kơtơ̆ng băt kơ klo sư lôch boih, na nhơ̆m hmoi."
"And when her mourning was over, David sent and brought her to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.","Hlôi kơ năr 'bŭ pơdong boih, Đawit athei đe năm iŏk sư oei lăm hnam pơtao; duch noh jing pơm akăn pơtao Đawit, tơpŭ ăn kơ pơtao minh 'nu kon drŏ-nglo, mă-lei dôm tơdrong Đawit pơm noh ưh kơ lăp đon Kră Yang ôh."
"Then the LORD sent Nathan to David. And he came to him, and said to him: “There were two men in one city, one rich and the other poor.","Kră Yang wơh Nathan năm tơ'bơ̆p Đawit, sư pơma khan: “Lăm minh pôm pơlei 'nei đei 'bar 'nu bơngai, minh 'nu mơdrŏng minh 'nu dơnuh."
"The rich man had exceedingly many flocks and herds.","Bơngai mơdrŏng đei triu, rơmo lơ dêh."
"But the poor man had nothing, except one little ewe lamb which he had bought and nourished; and it grew up together with him and with his children. It ate of his own food and drank from his own cup and lay in his bosom; and it was like a daughter to him.","Bơngai dơnuh ưh kơ đei kiơ, sư đei lăp minh pôm triu akăn iĕ mă đơ̆ng sư răt; sư rong răi kon triu noh wơ̆ tih hơdai hăm kon hơ'lơ̆p sư tơ lăm hnam sư, kon triu iĕ noh sŏng sa hơdai sư, nhă đak minh pôm pơnhan hăm sư păng tep hăm sư. Sư lăng thoi minh 'nu kon drŏ-kăn sư kơdih."
"And a traveler came to the rich man, who refused to take from his own flock and from his own herd to prepare one for the wayfaring man who had come to him; but he took the poor man’s lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him.”","Lăm minh năr ei, đei minh 'nu bơngai tơmoi truh năm ngôi tơ bơngai mơdrŏng, bơngai mơdrŏng 'mêm kơ triu, rơmo sư ưh kơ wă rôp hơmet 'nhĕm sa ăn kơ tơmoi; 'nao truh noh, na sư rôp iŏk kon triu bơngai dơnuh noh pơm hơmet 'nhĕm sa ăn kơ tơmoi năm ngôi tơ sư noh.”"
"So David’s anger was greatly aroused against the man, and he said to Nathan, “As the LORD lives, the man who has done this shall surely die!","Đawit blĕk dêh kơ bơngai mơdrŏng noh, păng khan kơ Nathan: “Inh pơkă 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang arih ling-lang, bơngai pơm kơnê̆ dêh thoi noh trŏ kơ lôch!"
"And he shall restore fourfold for the lamb, because he did this thing and because he had no pity.”","Sư athei duh 'mong puăn plơ̆ng, yua kơ sư pơm thoi noh, sư ưh kơ đei jơhngơ̆m băt mơnat.”"
"Then Nathan said to David, “You are the man! Thus says the LORD God of Israel: ‘I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul.","Nathan khan kơ Đawit: “Pơtao boih bơngai noh!

"I gave you your master’s house and your master’s wives into your keeping, and gave you the house of Israel and Judah. And if that had been too little, I also would have given you much more!","Inh ăn kơ ih wei-lăng hnam yŏng tơ'ngla ih, Inh pơjao lu akăn yŏng tơ'ngla ih lăm ti ih ăn kơ ih pơm pơtao pơgơ̆r kon pơlei Isơrael păng Juđa, păng dah tơdrong noh ưh tam tôm mah lei Inh gô ăn thim kơ ih lơ hloh dơ̆ng."
"Why have you despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in His sight? You have killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword; you have taken his wife to be your wife, and have killed him with the sword of the people of Ammon.","Liơ ih ưh kơ băt hli yom kơ nơ̆r Kră Yang tơtă, na pơm tơdrong kơnê̆ dêh 'bơ̆t anăp Sư?

"Now therefore, the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised Me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.’","Thoi noh na, dao ưh kơ đei layơ pơdơh pơrăm hnam dơnŏ ih, yua kơ ih ưh kơ pơyom kơ Inh, tơgar iŏk akăn Uri, bơngai Hêtit, pơm akăn ih.”"
"Thus says the LORD: ‘Behold, I will raise up adversity against you from your own house; and I will take your wives before your eyes and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.","Kră Yang khan: “Inh gô pơm đơ̆ng kơdih hnam dơnŏ ih iung blah pơm kơ ih, 'bơ̆t tơm măt ih; Inh gô rôp lu akăn ih pơjao ăn kơ minh 'nu bơngai jê̆ ih, sư gô pơ'brơh kơ lu akăn ih 'bơ̆t hơdah kơ'năr 'bơ̆t anăp lơ bơngai."
"For you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, before the sun.’ ”","Ih pơm tơdrong noh chă klĕnh ôn, mă-lei Inh gô pơm tơdrong 'nâu hơdah kơ'năr 'bơ̆t anăp đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael.”"
"So David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against the LORD.” And Nathan said to David, “The LORD also has put away your sin; you shall not die.","Đawit khan kơ Nathan: “Inh pơm yoch boih hăm Kră Yang.” Nathan tơl: “Mă-lei Kră Yang sŭt boih tơdrong yoch ih, ih huay kơ lôch ôh."
"However, because by this deed you have given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also who is born to you shall surely die.”","Mă-lei yua kơ tơdrong ih pơjăm ưh kơ lăng boih Kră Yang lăm tơdrong 'nâu, na kon drŏ-nglo mă akăn ih 'nao tơpŭ kơ ih noh gô lôch.”"
"Then Nathan departed to his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah’s wife bore to David, and it became ill.","Lăp Nathan wih brŏk tơ hnam sư, Kră Yang pơm kơ kon nge mă akăn Uri 'nao rơneh ăn kơ Đawit noh jĭ dêh hloi."
"David therefore pleaded with God for the child, and David fasted and went in and lay all night on the ground.","Đawit krao khan apinh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei pơklaih nge noh, păng sư ơ̆t kơ sŏng sa; sư mơ̆t tơ lăm anih 'bĭch tơ teh prăt măng."
"So the elders of his house arose and went to him, to raise him up from the ground. But he would not, nor did he eat food with them.","Lu kră bơngai bơ̆jang đunh lăm hnam pơtao dơ̆ng tăp dăr tơiung sư đơ̆ng teh; mă-lei sư ưh kơ wă iung păng ưh kơ wă sŏng sa hơdai lu đe noh."
"Then on the seventh day it came to pass that the child died. And the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead. For they said, “Indeed, while the child was alive, we spoke to him, and he would not heed our voice. How can we tell him that the child is dead? He may do some harm!”","Lăm tơpơh năr nge noh lôch. Lu đĭch đam ưh kơ pơ̆n roi kơ sư băt kơ nge noh lôch; yua kơ lu sư pơma tơduă khan: “Kơplah nge noh oei arih, bơ̆n nŏng kơ pơma pơlung pơtao, pơtao ưh kơ mơ̆ng; na liơ bơ̆n pơ̆n roi kơ sư băt nge noh lôch? Hơmơt kơ sư rai pơm kơ akâu sư!”"
"When David saw that his servants were whispering, David perceived that the child was dead. Therefore David said to his servants, “Is the child dead?” And they said, “He is dead.”","'Bôh lu đĭch sư pơma mơmơnh băl, pơtao Đawit sư băt kơ nge noh lôch boih, na sư jet: “Hăm trŏ kơ nge noh lôch boih?” Lu sư tơl: “Trŏ boih, nge noh lôch boih.”"
"So David arose from the ground, washed and anointed himself, and changed his clothes; and he went into the house of the LORD and worshiped. Then he went to his own house; and when he requested, they set food before him, and he ate.","Kơplah noh, Đawit iung đơ̆ng teh, hum hơpĕch, pik đak pơgang 'bâu phu tơ akâu sư, hrŭk tơplih hơbĕn ao; sư mơ̆t tơ hnam Kră Yang drap kơkuh, đơ̆ng noh sư wih brŏk tơ hnam pơtao sư dơ̆ng, athei đe hơmet tơmam sŏng sa. Na lăp đe hơmet dang boih sư sŏng sa hloi."
"Then his servants said to him, “What is this that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive, but when the child died, you arose and ate food.”","Lu đĭch đam sư jet: “Yua kơ kiơ ih pơm thoi noh.

"And he said, “While the child was alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, ‘Who can tell whether the LORD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?’","Pơtao tơl: “Kơplah nge noh oei arih, inh ơ̆t kơ por păng nhơ̆m hmoi yua kơ inh tơchĕng khan: ‘Băt rŏ lăng Kră Yang wă mơnat kơ inh, păng ăn kơ nge noh arih.’"
"But now he is dead; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.”","Mă-lei dang ei sư lôch boih, inh wă ơ̆t kơ sŏng sa pơm kiơ dơ̆ng? Inh hăm gơh pơm kơ sư wơ̆t tơ âu dơ̆ng? Inh gô năm tơ sư, mă-lei sư ưh pă gơh wơ̆t wih tơ inh dơ̆ng.”"
"Then David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her and lay with her. So she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. Now the LORD loved him","Đawit pơlung Batsêba, akăn sư, Đawit năm tep hơdai hăm akăn sư; akăn sư tơpŭ kơ minh 'nu kon drŏ-nglo krao anăn sư Sôlômôn, Kră Yang 'mêm kơ sư dêh."
"and He sent word by the hand of Nathan the prophet: So he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.","Yua kơ Kră Yang 'mêm kơ nge noh dêh, na Sư wơh Nathan bơngai pơtruh nơ̆r sư krao anăn nge noh Jêđiđia."
"Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the people of Ammon, and took the royal city.","Jôap tơblah pơlei Rapba, pơlei tih bơngai Ammôn, păng wă blah iŏk pơlei pơtao noh."
"And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, “I have fought against Rabbah, and I have taken the city’s water supply.","Jôap wơh linh sư năm roi tơbăt kơ Đawit: “Inh oei tơblah hăm pơlei tih Rapba păng inh đei blah iŏk boih kơđông kơjăp anih wei mong đak."
"Now therefore, gather the rest of the people together and encamp against the city and take it, lest I take the city and it be called after my name.”","Dang ei, ih athei krao akŭm pơđĭ lu linh mă oei oei noh, năm wang blah iŏk pơlei tih noh, mưh inh blah iŏk kơnh đe krao pơlei noh anăn inh.”"
"So David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah, fought against it, and took it.","Pơtao Đawit krao akŭm pơđĭ lu linh, năm blah iŏk pơlei Rapba, na blah iŏk hloi pơlei noh."
"Then he took their king’s crown from his head. Its weight was a talent of gold, with precious stones. And it was set on David’s head. Also he brought out the spoil of the city in great abundance.","Pơtao Đawit sư plôh iŏk môk pơtao đơ̆ng kơ̆l rup yang Milkôm, na yơ̆l tơ kơ̆l sư; môk noh pơm păng maih trăp dang pêng-jĭt pơđăm kĭ, đei pơgong hăm minh găr tơmo gĭt.

"And he brought out the people who were in it, and put them to work with saws and iron picks and iron axes, and made them cross over to the brick works. So he did to all the cities of the people of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.","Sư kư̆m rôp kon pơlei lăm noh bơ̆jang kơ sư, jao ăn hơnuă, 'nhik, sung bơsei păng jang man gŏch; sư kư̆m pơm kơ đĭ-đăng lu pơlei bơngai Ammôn jang thoi noh.

"After this Absalom the son of David had a lovely sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.","Apsalôm, kon drŏ-nglo Đawit đei minh 'nu oh drŏ-kăn pôm mĕ 'bă, anăn sư Tamar, 'lơ̆ng guăng dêh. Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ noh đunh 'biơ̆, Amnôn kư̆m kon drŏ-nglo Đawit mĕ pha hưch kơ sư."
"Amnon was so distressed over his sister Tamar that he became sick; for she was a virgin. And it was improper for Amnon to do anything to her.","Amnôn hưch lăp wă dêh kơ Tamar oh drŏ-kăn sư kơdih pôm 'bă, yua kơ hrăn tơchĕng ưh kơsŭk mah truh tơ đei jĭ bơlŏ, yua kơ oh adruh sư Tamar.

"But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David’s brother. Now Jonadab was a very crafty man.","Na, Amnôn đei minh 'nu buăl juăt anăn sư Jônadap, kon drŏ-nglo Simêa, 'nhŏng Đawit; bơngai 'nâu chă hơlĕnh hơgei dêh."
"And he said to him, “Why are you, the king’s son, becoming thinner day after day? Will you not tell me?” Amnon said to him, “I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.”","Jônadap jet Amnôn: “Ơ kon pơtao, lơliơ rai đunh rai rơmơ̆n rơmok thoi noh?

"So Jonadab said to him, “Lie down on your bed and pretend to be ill. And when your father comes to see you, say to him, ‘Please let my sister Tamar come and give me food, and prepare the food in my sight, that I may see it and eat it from her hand.’ ”","Jônadap chă đon khan: “Ih athei 'bĭch kơpal giơng pơm bơlŏ; na mưh pơtao 'bă năm lăng, ih athei apinh: ‘Apinh 'bă ăn kơ Tama, oh drŏ-kăn inh năm wei-lăng inh; sư gô hơmet tơmam sa 'bơ̆t anăp inh; inh gô 'bôh sư, păng sư gô pôk hiŏng tơmam sa hăm ti sư kơdih ăn kơ inh.’ ”"
"Then Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill; and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, “Please let Tamar my sister come and make a couple of cakes for me in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.”","Na, Amnôn 'bĭch pơm bơlŏ, lăp 'bă sư pơtao năm lăng, na Amnôn pơma hăm pơtao: Inh apinh ih ăn kơ Tamar năm tơ âu, pơm 'bar tŏ 'bĕng iĕ 'bơ̆t anăp inh; păng gô pôk hiŏng 'bĕng noh hăm ti sư kơdih ăn kơ inh sa."
"And David sent home to Tamar, saying, “Now go to your brother Amnon’s house, and prepare food for him.”","Đawit wơh bơngai năm krao Tamar đơ̆ng hnam sư, khan kơ sư: “Kon athei năm tơ hnam Amnôn, 'nhŏng kon, pai hơmet tơmam sa kơ sư.”"
"So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was lying down. Then she took flour and kneaded it, made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes.","Tamar năm truh tơ hnam 'nhŏng sư Amnôn, 'bôh oei 'bĭch kơpal giơng, Tamar iŏk tơpŭng 'ba mi, lŭk chơpĕt man pơm 'bĕng iĕ 'bơ̆t anăp 'nhŏng sư păng hơtŭk ăn."
"And she took the pan and placed them out before him, but he refused to eat. Then Amnon said, “Have everyone go out from me.” And they all went out from him.","Tamar pôk tơjur gŏ păng kep iŏk 'bĕng năm ăn kơ 'nhŏng sư sa. Mă-lei Amnôn ưh kơ 'maih sa.

"Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food into the bedroom, that I may eat from your hand.” And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them to Amnon her brother in the bedroom.","Amnôn khan kơ Tamar: “Oh pôk tơmam sa na mơ̆t tơ lăm anih ăn kơ 'nhŏng sa.” Tamar iŏk hloi lu 'bĕng iĕ đơ̆ng sư pơm, pôk ăn kơ Amnôn; 'nhŏng sư, tơ lăm anih."
"Now when she had brought them to him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, “Come, lie with me, my sister.”","Wă Tamar pôk hiŏng 'bĕng năm jê̆ giơng, Amnôn rôp dui na khan: “Oh, năm tơ âu 'bĭch hăm 'nhŏng.”"
"But she answered him, “No, my brother, do not force me, for no such thing should be done in Israel. Do not do this disgraceful thing!","Mă-lei Tamar pơjăng: “Ưh kơ gơh 'nhŏng; 'nĕ kơ pơm pơ'brơh pơgŏ inh, yua kơ lăm char Isơrael ưh kơ đei bu pơm thoi noh. 'Nĕ kơ pơm tơdrong kơnê̆ 'nâu!"
"And I, where could I take my shame? And as for you, you would be like one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.”","Inh gô pŭ iŏk tơdrong mơlâu âu mă năm tơ yơ? Na đe gô jô̆ 'nhŏng thoi minh 'nu bơngai kơnê̆ lăm char Isơrael.

"However, he would not heed her voice; and being stronger than she, he forced her and lay with her.","Mă-lei Amnôn ưh kơ mơ̆ng; yua kơ sư pran hloh, na tơrôp pơgŏ hloi."
"Then Amnon hated her exceedingly, so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, “Arise, be gone!”","Na Amnôn hơlơ̆ jing blĕk areh kơ Tamar, sư areh dêh hloh kơ jơhngơ̆m sư hưch adrol ki, Amnôn pơpuh tơlĕch sư: “Iung weh đơ̆ng âu!”"
"So she said to him, “No, indeed! This evil of sending me away is worse than the other that you did to me.” But he would not listen to her.","Tamar apinh lung: “'Nĕ kơ pơpuh inh, ơ 'nhŏng, tơdrong kơnê̆ ih pơpuh inh tih hloh kơ tơdrong kơnê̆ ih pơm kơ inh boih!” Mă-lei sư ưh kơ wă mơ̆ng hloi."
"Then he called his servant who attended him, and said, “Here! Put this woman out, away from me, and bolt the door behind her.”","Amnôn krao minh 'nu đam sư khan: “Pơpuh bơngai drŏ-kăn 'nâu lĕch weh đơ̆ng muh măt inh! Đơ̆ng noh tang chơkăl lê̆ 'măng mưh sư lĕch.”"
"Now she had on a robe of many colors, for the king’s virgin daughters wore such apparel. And his servant put her out and bolted the door behind her.","Na đĭch đam Amnôn puh tơlĕch păng chơkăl lê̆ 'măng.

"Then Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her robe of many colors that was on her, and laid her hand on her head and went away crying bitterly.","Tamar klă tơnuh kơpal kơ̆l sư, na hek ao ti tai mă sư oei hrŭk noh. Păng iŏk ti klơ̆p muh măt, nơnăm rah nhơ̆m ôr rah."
"And Absalom her brother said to her, “Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now hold your peace, my sister. He is your brother; do not take this thing to heart.” So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom’s house.","Apsalôm; 'nhŏng sư jet: “Hăm trŏ kơ Amnôn, 'nhŏng kơ oh; tơrôp 'bĭch hăm oh ưh?

"But when King David heard of all these things, he was very angry.","Pơtao Đawit hil blĕk dêh kơtơ̆ng dôm tơdrong noh."
"And Absalom spoke to his brother Amnon neither good nor bad. For Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.","Apsalôm blĕk dêh kơ Amnôn ưh pă đei gơh pơma nơ̆r ayơ 'lơ̆ng dah kơnê̆ hăm Amnôn, yua kơ Amnôn pơ'brơh kơ Tamar, oh drŏ-kăn sư."
"And it came to pass, after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal Hazor, which is near Ephraim; so Absalom invited all the king’s sons.","'Bar sơnăm đơ̆ng rŏng kơplah năr Apsalôm yuă sŏk triu sư tơ pơlei Baal Harsôl jê̆ hơdral pơlei tih Êphraim, Apsalôm sư krao wơ̆n đĭ-đăng lu kon pơtao."
"Then Absalom came to the king and said, “Kindly note, your servant has sheepshearers; please, let the king and his servants go with your servant.”","Apsalôm năm tơ pơtao na khan: Đĭch đam ih đei boih lu bơngai năm yuă sŏk triu na apinh ih hăm linh wei ih năm ngôi hơdai tơ hnam inh."
"But the king said to Absalom, “No, my son, let us not all go now, lest we be a burden to you.” Then he urged him, but he would not go; and he blessed him.","Mă-lei pơtao tơl khan: Ưh kơ gơh kon; đĭ-đăng lu bơ̆n ưh kơ gơh wang năm tơ hnam kon, yua kơnh pơm pơhiơ̆k kon.

"Then Absalom said, “If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us.” And the king said to him, “Why should he go with you?”","Apsalôm pơma dơ̆ng: “Tơdah pơtao ưh kơ năm, apinh ăn Amnôn, 'nhŏng inh, năm ngôi tơ nhôn.” Pơtao jet: “Kơlih kơ kiơ sư athei năm?”"
"But Absalom urged him; so he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him.","Apsalôm apinh lung dĭng mă truh pơtao ăn Amnôn păng đĭ-đăng kon pơtao năm ngôi et sa hăm sư."
"Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, “Watch now, when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, ‘Strike Amnon!’ then kill him. Do not be afraid. Have I not commanded you? Be courageous and valiant.”","Apsalôm pơkă kơ lu đĭch đam sư: “Athei kơchăng lăng kơplah Amnôn hiôk chơt wă suai kơ tơdrô, inh athei lu iĕm: Teh Amnôn, lu iĕm athei pơlôch sư hloi, ưh kơ hli kơ kiơ, noh đơ̆ng inh athei lu iĕm.

"So the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose, and each one got on his mule and fled.","Lu đĭch đam Apsalôm pơlôch Amnôn pơm kiơ̆ thoi yŏng tơ'ngla lu sư pơkă. Kơplah noh, lu kon pơtao nai iung hao aseh kơdâu chă ôn đĭ."
"And it came to pass, while they were on the way, that news came to David, saying, “Absalom has killed all the king’s sons, and not one of them is left!”","Kơplah lu kon pơtao oei tơ rok trong, đei roi ăn truh tơ pơtao Đawit kơtơ̆ng khan Apsalôm pơlôch đĭ lu kon pơtao boih, ưh kơ đei minh 'nu bu oei arih."

"Then Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David’s brother, answered and said, “Let not my lord suppose they have killed all the young men, the king’s sons, for only Amnon is dead. For by the command of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.","Na Jônadap, kon drŏ-nglo Simêa, mon pơtao Đawit, pơma khan: “Apinh yŏng inh ih 'nĕ ngeh khan pơlôch đĭ lu kon pơtao boih; lăp minh 'nu Amnôn đĕch lôch; noh tơdrong Apsalôm pơrơ̆ng wă pơm đơ̆ng năr Amnôn pơ'brơh kơ Tamar, oh drŏ-kăn sư."
"Now therefore, let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead. For only Amnon is dead.”","Thoi noh na apinh pơtao yŏng tơ'ngla inh 'nĕ kơ tơtăm khan pơlôch đĭ-đăng kon pơtao boih; lăp minh 'nu Amnôn đĕch lôch.”"
"Then Absalom fled. And the young man who was keeping watch lifted his eyes and looked, and there, many people were coming from the road on the hillside behind him.","Kơplah noh Apsalôm kơdâu weh boih.

"So it was, as soon as he had finished speaking, that the king’s sons indeed came, and they lifted up their voice and wept. Also the king and all his servants wept very bitterly.","'Nao đang kơ Jônadap pơma, na 'bôh lu kon pơtao truh; lu sư nhơ̆m ôr. Pơtao păng đĭ-đăng đĭch đam nhơ̆m hmoi ôr ơh sơ'ngon dêh tơpă."
"But Absalom fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.","Na Apsalôm kơdâu weh, păng năm ôn tơ hnam Thanmai kon drŏ-nglo Amihut, pơtao dêh Gêsur Đawit sơ'ngon kơ kon drŏ-nglo sư ling-lang rim năr."
"So Absalom fled and went to Geshur, and was there three years.","Apsalôm kơdâu tơ dêh Gêsur oei tơ noh pêng sơnăm."
"And King David longed to go to Absalom. For he had been comforted concerning Amnon, because he was dead.","Pơtao hơi 'biơ̆ sơ'ngon kơ Amnôn lôch boih, na pơtao 'blŏk 'maih 'moi kiơ̆ Apsalôm."
"So Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was concerned about Absalom.","Jôap kon drŏ-nglo Sêruia, băt kơ jơhngơ̆m pơtao 'blŏk kơ Apsalôm"
"And Joab sent to Tekoa and brought from there a wise woman, and said to her, “Please pretend to be a mourner, and put on mourning apparel; do not anoint yourself with oil, but act like a woman who has been mourning a long time for the dead.","Jôap wơh bơngai năm tơ pơlei Têkôa chă minh 'nu bơngai drŏ-kăn gơh hơgei, sư pơkă kơ drŏ-kăn ei khan: “Ih athei pơm thoi bơngai sơ'ngon kơ đei bơngai lôch, hrŭk ao sơ'ngon, 'nĕ kơ pik pơgang 'bâu phu, ih pơm akâu thoi bơngai drŏ-kăn sơ'ngon kơ đei bơngai lôch đĭ đunh năr boih."
"Go to the king and speak to him in this manner.” So Joab put the words in her mouth.","Ih apinh wă tơ'bơ̆p pơtao roi ăn kơ pơtao thoi âu.” Jôap bơtho drŏ-kăn ei wă kơ sư pơma."
"And when the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground and prostrated herself, and said, “Help, O king!”","Bơngai drŏ-kăn pơlei Têkôa năm pơma roi kơ pơtao, sư drap tơ teh kơkuh, na khan: “Kơkuh kơ ih pơtao, apinh ih dŏng inh!”"

"Now your maidservant had two sons; and the two fought with each other in the field, and there was no one to part them, but the one struck the other and killed him.","Inh đĭch đam ih.

"And now the whole family has risen up against your maidservant, and they said, ‘Deliver him who struck his brother, that we may execute him for the life of his brother whom he killed; and we will destroy the heir also.’ So they would extinguish my ember that is left, and leave to my husband neither name nor remnant on the earth.”","Na dang ei đĭ-đăng lu 'nhŏng oh lu sư iung ayăt hăm inh đam drŏ-kăn ih, lu sư khan: ‘Pơjao ăn bơngai pơlôch oh sư lê̆ kơ nhôn pơlôch sư, wă iung kơting pham kơ oh sư, mă khan sư bơngai pơtrơp ioi, lu bơ̆n kư̆m gô pơlôch sư!’ Na sư gô pĭt tŭk ngar ŭnh ngŭr oei oei, wă kơ klo inh ưh pă đei anăn păng bơngai pơtrơp ioi, adrĕch adrung kơpal teh.”"

"And the woman of Tekoa said to the king, “My lord, O king, let the iniquity be on me and on my father’s house, and the king and his throne be guiltless.”","Bơngai drŏ-kăn Têkôa tơl dơ̆ng: “Kơkuh kơ pơtao yŏng tơ'ngla inh, lê̆ tơdrong yoch tuh kơpal inh păng adrĕch hnam 'bă inh, gah pơtao păng anih pơtao ưh kơ đei 'bơm ôh.”"
"So the king said, “Whoever says anything to you, bring him to me, and he shall not touch you anymore.”","Pơtao khan dơ̆ng: “Tơdah đei bu pơm anat kơ ih dơ̆ng, athei ba sư tơ inh, lu sư gô ưh kơ pơ̆n hơtŭt 'bơm ih dơ̆ng.”"
"Then she said, “Please let the king remember the LORD your God, and do not permit the avenger of blood to destroy anymore, lest they destroy my son.” And he said, “As the LORD lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the ground.”","Drŏ-kăn ei khan dơ̆ng: “Apinh pơtao krao apinh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ih găn wă kơ lu bơngai pơm 'mong huay kơ iung kơting ưh pă pơrăm păng pơlôch kon drŏ-nglo inh.” Pơtao tơl: “Inh pao anăn Kră Yang arih ling-lang na pơkă khan, minh ioi sŏk đơ̆ng kơ̆l kon drŏ-nglo ih gô ưh kơ đei hơlŭng tơ teh!”"
"Therefore the woman said, “Please, let your maidservant speak another word to my lord the king.” And he said, “Say on.”","Drŏ-kăn ei khan dơ̆ng: “Apinh pơtao ăn kơ inh đĭch đam ih roi minh nơ̆r kơ pơtao dơ̆ng pơtao khan ‘Ih roi bĕ’ ”"
"So the woman said: “Why then have you schemed such a thing against the people of God? For the king speaks this thing as one who is guilty, in that the king does not bring his banished one home again.","Bơngai drŏ-kăn noh khan: Lei liơ pơtao tơchĕng wă pơrăm kon pơlei Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei thoi noh?

"For we will surely die and become like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again. Yet God does not take away a life; but He devises means, so that His banished ones are not expelled from Him.","Đĭ-đăng lu bơ̆n bu bu kư̆m lôch, thoi tuh đak tơ teh, ưh kơ gơh chup iŏk dơ̆ng.

"Now therefore, I have come to speak of this thing to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid. And your maidservant said, ‘I will now speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his maidservant.","“Dang ei, inh năm roi tơdrong 'nâu kơ pơtao yŏng tơ'ngla inh, noh yua kơ kon pơlei pơma tơhli. Lei inh tơchĕng khan: ‘Inh gô năm roi kơ pơtao, rŏ lăng pơtao gô ăn kơ đam drŏ-kăn pơtao tơdrong sư apinh."
"For the king will hear and deliver his maidservant from the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together from the inheritance of God.’","Pơtao gô mơ̆ng nơ̆r apinh păng dŏng pơklaih đam drŏ-kăn pơtao đơ̆ng ti bơngai 'maih pơlôch inh, păng kon drŏ-nglo inh, hiong dơ̆ng kon pơlei Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei.’"
"Your maidservant said, ‘The word of my lord the king will now be comforting; for as the angel of God, so is my lord the king in discerning good and evil. And may the LORD your God be with you.’ ”","Đam drŏ-kăn pơtao tơchĕng khan dơ̆ng: ‘Apinh nơ̆r đơ̆ng pơtao yŏng tơ'ngla inh pơma pơkă ăn hiôk-hian, yua kơ pơtao yŏng tơ'ngla inh thoi lĕ minh 'nu linh jang 'lơ̆ng Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei, băt kơ lăng tơdrong 'lơ̆ng păng tơdrong kơnê̆.

"Then the king answered and said to the woman, “Please do not hide from me anything that I ask you.” And the woman said, “Please, let my lord the king speak.”","Pơtao khan: “'Nĕ ôn kơ inh tơdrong kiơ inh wă apinh ih.” Bơngai drŏ-kăn khan: “Apinh pơtao yŏng tơ'ngla inh apinh bĕ.”"
"So the king said, “Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?” And the woman answered and said, “As you live, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken. For your servant Joab commanded me, and he put all these words in the mouth of your maidservant.","Pơtao apinh: “Hăm trŏ kư̆m đei ti Jôap mơ̆t hơdai lăm dôm tơdrong 'nâu?” Bơngai drŏ-kăn tơl: Pơtao yŏng tơ'ngla inh, inh yua tơdrong arih pơtao na pơkă, trŏ thoi nơ̆r pơtao đei khan.

"To bring about this change of affairs your servant Joab has done this thing; but my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of the angel of God, to know everything that is in the earth.”","Jôap, đĭch đam pơtao, pơm thoi noh, wă hơlơ̆ kơ tơdrong truh 'nâu.

"And the king said to Joab, “All right, I have granted this thing. Go therefore, bring back the young man Absalom.”","Pơtao khan, kơ Jôap: “Inh ăn boih tơdrong ih apinh 'nâu, năm iŏk Apsalôm brŏk tơ âu bĕ.”"
"Then Joab fell to the ground on his face and bowed himself, and thanked the king. And Joab said, “Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord, O king, in that the king has fulfilled the request of his servant.”","Jôap drap tơ teh kơkuh, păng khan: Apinh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei tuh ăn tơdrong pŭn hiôk kơ pơtao, Pơtao yŏng tơ'ngla inh.

"So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.","Jôap iung hloi, năm truh tơ Gêsur, anhăk Apsalôm wih tơ pơlei Jêrusalem."
"And the king said, “Let him return to his own house, but do not let him see my face.” So Absalom returned to his own house, but did not see the king’s face.","Pơtao khan: “Ăn sư brŏk tơ hnam sư kơdih ưh kơ đei năm tơ'bơ̆p pơtao.” Na Apsalôm brŏk tơ hnam sư kơdih ưh kơ đei tơ'bơ̆p pơtao ôh."
"Now in all Israel there was no one who was praised as much as Absalom for his good looks. From the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.","Kơplah noh lăm đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael ưh kơ đei minh 'nu bơngai ayơ đei pơư kơ akâu jăn sư 'lơ̆ng hloh thoi lĕ Apsalôm 'lơ̆ng; iŏk đơ̆ng tơpang jơ̆ng truh tơ kơ̆l, ưh kơ đei lao 'bơ̆t yơ."
"And when he cut the hair of his head—at the end of every year he cut it because it was heavy on him—when he cut it, he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels according to the king’s standard.","Rim sơnăm wă tôch sư juăt kơ yuă sŏk, yua kơ sŏk pơm kơ sư trăp kơ̆l, na sŏk sư yuă chĕp kŏng trăp đei hloh kơ 'bar kĭ kiơ̆ kơ 'long kŏng hnam pơtao."
"To Absalom were born three sons, and one daughter whose name was Tamar. She was a woman of beautiful appearance.","Apsalôm pơjing pêng 'nu kon drŏ-nglo păng minh 'nu kon drŏ-kăn, anăn sư Tamar sư bơngai adruh 'lơ̆ng guăng dêh."
"And Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, but did not see the king’s face.","Apsalôm oei tơ lăm pơlei Jêrusalem lăm 'bar sơnăm, ưh kơ đei tơ'bơ̆p muh măt 'bă sư."
"Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but he would not come to him. And when he sent again the second time, he would not come.","Apsalôm wơh bơngai năm wơ̆n Jôap, wă kơ năm pơma dơnuh kơ pơtao, mă-lei Jôap ưh kơ năm. Apsalôm wơh dơ̆ng, bơngai năm wơ̆t mă 'bar, mă-lei Jôap oei sơngah, ưh kơ năm."
"So he said to his servants, “See, Joab’s field is near mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire.” And Absalom’s servants set the field on fire.","Apsalôm khan kơ lu đĭch đam sư: “Lăng bĕ to chŭn Jôap, mă đei pơtăm 'ba tơ'bâu, jê̆ chŭn inh; năm soh lê̆ bĕ chŭn sư noh.” Lu đĭch đam Apsalôm iŏk ŭnh soh hloi chŭn Jôap noh."
"Then Joab arose and came to Absalom’s house, and said to him, “Why have your servants set my field on fire?”","Jôap iung năm hloi tơ hnam Apsalôm na jet: “Yua kơ kiơ lu đĭch đam ih soh chŭn inh?”"
"And Absalom answered Joab, “Look, I sent to you, saying, ‘Come here, so that I may send you to the king, to say, “Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me to be there still.” ’ Now therefore, let me see the king’s face; but if there is iniquity in me, let him execute me.”","Apsalôm tơl sư: “Inh wơh bơngai năm krao ih, năm tơ âu.

"So Joab went to the king and told him. And when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king. Then the king kissed Absalom.","Lei na Jôap năm tơ pơtao roi tơbăt lu nơ̆r noh. Pơtao krao hloi Apsalôm năm; sư mơ̆t lăm anih pơtao, drap tơ teh kơkuh 'bơ̆t anăp pơtao, na pơtao chŭm Apsalôm."
"After this it happened that Absalom provided himself with chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ noh Apsalôm chă lê̆ gre aseh hăm pơđăm-jĭt 'nu linh kơdâu adrol kơ gre aseh."
"Now Absalom would rise early and stand beside the way to the gate. So it was, whenever anyone who had a lawsuit came to the king for a decision, that Absalom would call to him and say, “What city are you from?” And he would say, “Your servant is from such and such a tribe of Israel.”","Apsalôm juăt kơ iung đơ̆ng hrôih, dơ̆ng jê̆ cheng trong mơ̆t 'bơ̆t 'măng jang pơlei.

"Then Absalom would say to him, “Look, your case is good and right; but there is no deputy of the king to hear you.”","Apsalôm juăt kơ pơma: “'Lơ̆ng dêh, tơdrong ih apinh trŏ păng lăp tơpă; mă-lei pơtao ưh kơ đei wơh bơngai bu wă mơ̆ng ih ôh.”"
"Moreover Absalom would say, “Oh, that I were made judge in the land, and everyone who has any suit or cause would come to me; then I would give him justice.”","Apsalôm khan dơ̆ng: “Ôi! Rŏ kơ đe pôk inh pơm yŏng sek tơlang lăm dêh char! Dah đei bơngai ayơ đei tơdrong kiơ wă sek tơlang, năm truh tơ inh, inh gô sek tơlang tơpăt hơnơ̆ng ăn kơ lu sư.”"
"And so it was, whenever anyone came near to bow down to him, that he would put out his hand and take him and kiss him.","Tơdah bơngai bu năm jê̆ drap kơkuh kơ sư, Apsalôm thar kuăr tơiung sư păng chŭm hloi."
"In this manner Absalom acted toward all Israel who came to the king for judgment. So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.","Apsalôm pơm thoi noh hăm đĭ-đăng lu bơngai Isơrael năm tơ pơtao wă apinh sek tơlang; thoi noh Apsalôm gơh đei iŏk jơhngơ̆m klơm klak bơngai Isơrael boih."
"Now it came to pass after forty years that Absalom said to the king, “Please, let me go to Hebron and pay the vow which I made to the LORD.","Puăn sơnăm đơ̆ng rŏnga Apsalôm năm khan kơ pơtao: “Apinh ih ăn kơ kon năm tơ Hêbrôn wă pơkeh tơdrong krao apinh Kră Yang."
"For your servant took a vow while I dwelt at Geshur in Syria, saying, ‘If the LORD indeed brings me back to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.’ ”","Yua kơ kơplah đĭch đam ih oei tơ Gêsur lăm char Siri, đei krao apinh. ‘Tơdah Kră Yang ăn inh wih tơ pơlei Jêrusalem, lei inh gô năm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang, tơ Hêbrôn.’ ”"
"And the king said to him, “Go in peace.” So he arose and went to Hebron.","Pơtao tơl khan: “Kon năm mă 'lơ̆ng. Na Apsalôm iung, năm truh tơ Hêbrôn.”"
"Then Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, ‘Absalom reigns in Hebron!’ ”","Apsalôm kư̆m wơh lu bơngai năm tơ jơ̆p lăm lu adrĕch adrung Isơrael na pơkă khan: “Lăp 'nhŏng oh kơtơ̆ng re đe hlôm keng, lei athei wang ôr khan: ‘Apsalôm pơm pơtao tơ Hêbrôn!’ ”"
"And with Absalom went two hundred men invited from Jerusalem, and they went along innocently and did not know anything.","Đei 'bar-hrĕng 'nu bơngai oei tơ pơlei Jêrusalem mă Apsalôm krao pơtơm, năm hơdai hăm sư, lu sư năm hăm đon 'lơ̆ng đĕch ưh kơ băt kiơ gah tơdrong Apsalôm wă pơm kơnê̆."
"Then Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor, from his city—from Giloh—while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy grew strong, for the people with Absalom continually increased in number.","Kơplah Apsalôm wă pơyơ̆r tơmam soi, wơh đe năm krao Ahithôphel sư bơngai hơgei tơgŭm chă pơđâu kơ Đawit oei tơ pơlei Gilô, pơlei sư hơdai.

"Now a messenger came to David, saying, “The hearts of the men of Israel are with Absalom.”","Đei bơngai năm roi tơbăt ăn kơ Đawit: “Kon pơlei Isơrael kiơ̆ khŭl Apsalôm.”"
"So David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, “Arise, and let us flee, or we shall not escape from Absalom. Make haste to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly and bring disaster upon us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword.”","Đawit khan hloi hăm lu bơngai bơ̆jang oei hăm sư lăm pơlei Jêrusalem, “lu bơ̆n athei jah iung kơdâu weh bĕ.

"And the king’s servants said to the king, “We are your servants, ready to do whatever my lord the king commands.”","Lu bơngai bơ̆jang kơ pơtao tơl khan: “Mă tơdrong pơtao yŏng tơ'ngla lu nhôn wă pơm thoi yơ, lei lu nhôn đĭch đam ih gô pơm kiơ̆ hloi.”"
"Then the king went out with all his household after him. But the king left ten women, concubines, to keep the house.","Lei na, pơtao lĕch năm hơdai hăm đĭ-đăng lăm hnam pơtao; mă-lei pơtao oei lê̆ mơjĭt 'nu akăn kơnhŏng sư wă wei hnam pơtao sư."
"And the king went out with all the people after him, and stopped at the outskirts.","Pơtao lĕch năm đei kon pơlei pơla kư̆m kiơ̆, lu sư pơdơh 'bơ̆t hnam tuch-luch kơ pơlei."
"Then all his servants passed before him; and all the Cherethites, all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who had followed him from Gath, passed before the king.","Đĭ-đăng đĭch đam pơtao păng đĭ lu bơngai Kêrêthit, bơngai Phêlêthit, păng tơdrâu-hrĕng bơngai Gitit, mă oei hơdai pơtao đơ̆ng pơlei Gat yak adrol kơ pơtao."
"Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why are you also going with us? Return and remain with the king. For you are a foreigner and also an exile from your own place.","Pơtao jet Itai, bơngai Gitit: “Ih kư̆m 'maih năm hơdai hăm lu nhôn mơ̆n ah? Wih bĕ, oei hăm pơtao Apsalôm.

"In fact, you came only yesterday. Should I make you wander up and down with us today, since I go I know not where? Return, and take your brethren back. Mercy and truth be with you.”","Ih oei hăm inh 'nao năr brei, na năr 'nâu ih wă kiơ̆ chă jăk ah. 'Nhŏ kơdih inh kư̆m ưh kơ băt wă năm tơ yơ? Lei ih jah wih bĕ păng chông lu 'nhŏng oh ih.

"But Ittai answered the king and said, “As the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, surely in whatever place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also your servant will be.”","Itai tơl: “Đei Kră Yang arih ling-lang lăng tông păng 'bơ̆t anăp pơtao yŏng inh, oei arih na inh pơkă: Mă pơtao yŏng inh oei tơ yơ, inh kư̆m oei tơ noh, mă lôch mă arih.”"
"So David said to Ittai, “Go, and cross over.” Then Ittai the Gittite and all his men and all the little ones who were with him crossed over.","Pơtao Đawit khan kơ Itai: “Ơ lei rai yak adrol bĕ.” Thoi noh na Itai bơngai Gitit yak hơdai hăm đĭ-đăng kon pơlei păng lu hnam dơnŏ sư, đĭ-đăng lu sư rai yak adrol."
"And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people crossed over. The king himself also crossed over the Brook Kidron, and all the people crossed over toward the way of the wilderness.","Đĭ-đăng kon pơlei lăm pơlei Jêrusalem nhơ̆m ôr re kơplah lu khŭl tơpôl kon pơlei yak năm.

"There was Zadok also, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God. And they set down the ark of God, and Abiathar went up until all the people had finished crossing over from the city.","Kŭm đei Sađŏk 'bok soi păng đĭ-đăng bơngai Lêwi tung Hom pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei.

"Then the king said to Zadok, “Carry the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of the LORD, He will bring me back and show me both it and His dwelling place.","Pơtao khan dơ̆ng kơ Sadok 'bok soi: “Tung bĕ Hom pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei wơ̆t tơ lăm pơlei tih.

"But if He says thus: ‘I have no delight in you,’ here I am, let Him do to me as seems good to Him.”","Mă-lei tơdah Kră Yang khan: ‘Inh ưh kơ lăp kơ ih,’ lei apinh Kră Yang hơmet inh kiơ̆ kơ Kră Yang lăp đon lăng 'lơ̆ng!”"
"The king also said to Zadok the priest, “Are you not a seer? Return to the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.","Pơtao khan dơ̆ng: “Ih hăm hlôh, ih hăm 'bok soi Abiathar athei wih dơ̆ng tơ pơlei mă hiôk rơnŭk hơdai hăm 'bar 'nu kon drŏ-nglo iĕm, Ahimaas kon drŏ-nglo ih păng Jônathan kon drŏ-nglo Abiathar."
"See, I will wait in the plains of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.”","Gah inh, inh răp gô lăm char glă dĭng truh kơtơ̆ng nơ̆r đơ̆ng măr iĕm roi tơbăt ăn kơ inh.”"
"Therefore Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem. And they remained there.","Thoi noh na Sađŏk 'bok soi păng Abiathar tung ba Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei brŏk tơ pơlei Jêrusalem păng oei hloi tơ noh."
"So David went up by the Ascent of the Mount of Olives, and wept as he went up; and he had his head covered and went barefoot. And all the people who were with him covered their heads and went up, weeping as they went up.","Đawit tŏk tơ kông ôliwơ; sư yak rah nhơ̆m rah gom lê̆ kơ̆l păng yak tơpang jơ̆ng hoh.

"Then someone told David, saying, “Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.” And David said, “O LORD, I pray, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness!”","Đe roi ăn kơ Đawit: “Ahithôphel kư̆m minh khŭl iung blah hơdai hăm Apsalôm.” Đawit krao apinh: “Ơ Kră Yang!

"Now it happened when David had come to the top of the mountain, where he worshiped God—there was Hushai the Archite coming to meet him with his robe torn and dust on his head.","Lăp kơplah Đawit năm tŏk truh tơ kơ̆l kông, anih mă đe kơkuh kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei, đei Husai, bơngai Arkit, năm sơng tơ'bơ̆p sư, ao tơhek hiah păng kơ̆l 'bĕnh kơ 'mui teh."
"David said to him, “If you go on with me, then you will become a burden to me.","Đawit khan kơ sư: “Tơdah ih năm hơdai hăm inh, lei ih gô pơhiơ̆k inh."
"But if you return to the city, and say to Absalom, ‘I will be your servant, O king; as I was your father’s servant previously, so I will now also be your servant,’ then you may defeat the counsel of Ahithophel for me.","Mă-lei tơdah ih brŏk tơ pơlei, roi ăn kơ Apsalôm: ‘Ơ pơtao!

"And do you not have Zadok and Abiathar the priests with you there? Therefore it will be that whatever you hear from the king’s house, you shall tell to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.","To 'bar 'nu 'bok soi Sađŏk păng Abiathar kư̆m oei tơ noh hơdai hăm ih, ih athei roi ăn kơ bre sư băt dôm tơdrong kiơ ih băt đơ̆ng lăm hnam pơtao."
"Indeed they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son, and Jonathan, Abiathar’s son; and by them you shall send me everything you hear.”","'Bar 'nu bre sư kư̆m đei 'bar 'nu kon drŏ-nglo oei tơ noh, Ahimaas kon drŏ-nglo Sađŏk păng Jônathan, kon drŏ-nglo Abiathar; ih wơh bre sư athei năm roi tơbăt ăn kơ inh dôm tơdrong ih đei kơtơ̆ng.”"
"So Hushai, David’s friend, went into the city. And Absalom came into Jerusalem.","Na Husai, buăl juăt Đawit; wih dơ̆ng tơ pơlei lăp kơplah Apsalôm 'nao wih mơ̆t lăm pơlei Jêrusalem."
"When David was a little past the top of the mountain, there was Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth, who met him with a couple of saddled donkeys, and on them two hundred loaves of bread, one hundred clusters of raisins, one hundred summer fruits, and a skin of wine.","Đawit 'nao tŏk hlôi kơ kơ̆l kông, na tơ'bơ̆p Siba, đĭch đam Mephibôset, năm sơng chông ba 'bar tŏ aseh iĕ tah an đei tơlei pơhơ̆p păng kơpal rŏng aseh chơ 'bar-hrĕng tơpei 'bĕng, minh-hrĕng hơchô̆ plei hơmu, minh-hrĕng tŏ 'bĕng iĕ plei hơra, păng minh pôm get hơkar 'bĕnh kơ sik hơmu."
"And the king said to Ziba, “What do you mean to do with these?” So Ziba said, “The donkeys are for the king’s household to ride on, the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat, and the wine for those who are faint in the wilderness to drink.”","Pơtao jet Siba: “Ih wă pơm kiơ kơ tơmam noh?” Siba khan: “'Bar tŏ aseh iĕ noh yua ăn kơ bơngai lăm hnam pơtao hao, 'bĕng păng plei hơmu noh yua pơm tơmam sa ăn kơ khŭl linh, na sik hơmu noh wă yua ăn kơ lu bơngai brŏk đơ̆ng char glă gleh lap huch.”"
"Then the king said, “And where is your master’s son?” And Ziba said to the king, “Indeed he is staying in Jerusalem, for he said, ‘Today the house of Israel will restore the kingdom of my father to me.’ ”","Pơtao apinh dơ̆ng: “Sâu drŏ-nglo yŏng tơ'ngla ih tơ yơ?” Siba tơl: “Sư oei tơ lăm pơlei Jêrusalem, sư tơchĕng khan: ‘Năr 'nâu rŏ lăng kon pơlei Isơrael gô pơdrâu kơ inh tang-dŏ pơtao teh đak 'bok inh.’ ”"
"So the king said to Ziba, “Here, all that belongs to Mephibosheth is yours.” And Ziba said, “I humbly bow before you, that I may find favor in your sight, my lord, O king!”","Pơtao pơma hăm Siba. “Lei na inh ăn kơ ih dôm tơmam, Mephibôset.” Siba tơl dơ̆ng: “Inh kơkuh bơnê kơ ih,” “apinh ăn kơ inh gơh lăp jơhngơ̆m ih yŏng tơ'ngla inh ling-lang.”"
"Now when King David came to Bahurim, there was a man from the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei the son of Gera, coming from there. He came out, cursing continuously as he came.","Pơtao Đawit 'nao truh tơ pơlei Bahurim, 'bôh minh 'nu bơngai lĕch đơ̆ng lăm pơlei noh, anăn sư Simêi, kon drŏ-nglo Gêra, sư đơ̆ng adrĕch adrung Sôl na năm rah hiap rah."
"And he threw stones at David and at all the servants of King David. And all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.","Simêi klơ̆m kơ Đawit tơmo păng đĭ-đăng lu đĭch đam sư. Mă khan đĭ-đăng kon pơlei pơla păng lu linh nuih kơtang oei yak gah 'ma gah 'ngiĕo tăp kơ pơtao."
"Also Shimei said thus when he cursed: “Come out! Come out! You bloodthirsty man, you rogue!","Simêi hiap Đawit khan: “Ơ bơngai pơlôch đe. Bơngai kư̆ kă! Weh bĕ, năm tơ nai bĕ!"
"The LORD has brought upon you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned; and the LORD has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son. So now you are caught in your own evil, because you are a bloodthirsty man!”","Kră Yang phak e, yua kơ đêl e pơlôch tuh pham lăm adrĕch adrung hnam dơnŏ Sôl.

"Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Please, let me go over and take off his head!”","Đơ̆ng noh Abisai, kon drŏ-nglo Sêruia, khan kơ pơtao: “Liơ kŏ lôch 'nâu pơ̆n hiap pơtao yŏng tơ'ngla inh? Apinh pơtao lê̆ kơ inh năm chơ̆ng kơ̆l sư.”"
"But the king said, “What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? So let him curse, because the LORD has said to him, ‘Curse David.’ Who then shall say, ‘Why have you done so?’ ”","Pơtao tơl khan: “Ơ lu kon drŏ-nglo Sêruia, tơdrong inh 'bơm kiơ kơ lu iĕm? Lê̆ Simêi hiap, tơdah noh đơ̆ng Kră Yang athei hiap inh, na bu pơ̆n jet sư: ‘Yua kơ kiơ ih pơm thoi noh?’ ”"
"And David said to Abishai and all his servants, “See how my son who came from my own body seeks my life. How much more now may this Benjamite? Let him alone, and let him curse; for so the LORD has ordered him.","Đawit khan dơ̆ng kơ Abisai păng đĭ lu bơngai jang kơ sư: “To, kon inh kơdih, đơ̆ng blu pôih inh pơjing, oei 'maih pơrăm tơdrong arih inh 'mơ̆i; pơma kiơ kơ bơngai Bênjamin 'nâu! Lê̆ sư loh lê̆ sư hiap inh, yua kơ Kră Yang athei sư."
"It may be that the LORD will look on my affliction, and that the LORD will repay me with good for his cursing this day.”","Băt Kră Yang lăng 'bôh boih tơdrong pơmat-tat inh, na ăn tơdrong pŭn hiôk tơplih tơdrong sư hiap năr 'nâu.”"
"And as David and his men went along the road, Shimei went along the hillside opposite him and cursed as he went, threw stones at him and kicked up dust.","Đawit păng lu đĭch đam sư yak nơnăm tơ anăp; na Simêi druh kiơ̆ trong tơter jơ̆ng kông. Sư nơnăm rah hiap pơtê̆ rah Đawit, klơ̆m tơmo, păng săi 'mui teh."
"Now the king and all the people who were with him became weary; so they refreshed themselves there.","Pơtao păng đĭ-đăng kon pơlei pơla kiơ̆ pơtao, năm truh tơ anih lu sư gleh lap ngăl păng pơdơh kơ lap tơ noh."
"Meanwhile Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem; and Ahithophel was with him.","Kơplah noh Apsalôm păng đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael mơ̆t lăm pơlei Jêrusalem, đei Ahithôphel kiơ̆ sư."
"And so it was, when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, came to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, “Long live the king! Long live the king!”","Kơplah Husai, bơngai Arkit, buăl juăt Đawit, năm tơ'bơ̆p Apsalôm, sư ôr khan: “Pơtao arih sot! Pơtao arih sot!”"
"So Absalom said to Hushai, “Is this your loyalty to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?”","Apsalôm jet Husai: “'Nâu ih wă tơ'bôh tơdrong ih 'mêm kơ buăl ih hă? Liơ mă ih ưh kơ năm kiơ̆ sư?”"
"And Hushai said to Absalom, “No, but whom the LORD and this people and all the men of Israel choose, his I will be, and with him I will remain.","Husai tơl Apsalôm: “Inh ưh kơ năm, inh gô kiơ̆ bơngai bu mă Kră Yang, kon pơlei 'nâu, păng đĭ-đăng kon pơlei Isơrael rơih iŏk; inh gô kiơ̆ păng oei hơdai bơngai noh."
"Furthermore, whom should I serve? Should I not serve in the presence of his son? As I have served in your father’s presence, so will I be in your presence.”","Hloh kơ noh dơ̆ng. Inh wă bơ̆jang kơ bu, dah ưh kơ bơ̆jang kơ kon drŏ-nglo buăl inh. Thoi inh bơ̆jang kơ 'bă pơtao thoi yơ, inh kư̆m gô bơ̆jang kơ ih thoi noh mơ̆n.”"
"Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give advice as to what we should do.”","Apsalôm khan kơ Ahithôphel: “Ih chă pơđâu lăng, lu bơ̆n athei pơm kiơ̆.”"
"And Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Go in to your father’s concubines, whom he has left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that you are abhorred by your father. Then the hands of all who are with you will be strong.”","Ahithôphel tơl: “Ih athei năm 'bĭch hăm lu akăn kơnhŏng 'bă ih mă lê̆ lu sư oei tơ noh wă wei-lăng hnam pơtao. Mưh đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael băt khan ih pơm kơnê̆ krưp kơ 'bă ih thoi noh, lei đĭ-đăng lu bơngai kiơ̆ ih, rai nuih kơtang hloh dơ̆ng.”"
"So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the top of the house, and Absalom went in to his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.","Đe pơm ăn kơ Apsalôm minh pôm bơsŭn tơ kơpal bơbŭng hnam pơtao, Apsalôm năm 'bĭch hơdai hăm lu akăn kơnhŏng 'bă sư. Đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael băt tơdrong noh."
"Now the advice of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if one had inquired at the oracle of God. So was all the advice of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.","Lăm kơplah noh đe lăng tơdrong tơchĕng Ahithôphel nhen thoi nơ̆r pơma đơ̆ng tơ'ngla Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei. Lu tơdrong tơchĕng Ahithôphel, mă pơtao Đawit, păng Apsalôm, tă kơ mơ̆ng kiơ̆ nơ̆r Ahithôphel thoi noh ngăl."
"Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Now let me choose twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue David tonight.","Ahithôphel pơma pơđâu hăm Apsalôm: “Apinh ih ăn kơ inh rơih iŏk mơjĭt-'bar rơbâu 'nu linh. Inh gô lĕch druh 'moi Đawit lăm măng 'nâu."
"I will come upon him while he is weary and weak, and make him afraid. And all the people who are with him will flee, and I will strike only the king.","Inh gô druh blah sư lăm kơplah sư rơmơ̆n gleh lap, phôch kơ jơhngơ̆m, pơm ăn kơ sư hli tơrơ; đĭ-đăng kon pơlei năm kiơ̆ sư gô kơdâu tơklah tơklang, inh gô pơlôch minh 'nu pơtao đĕch."
"Then I will bring back all the people to you. When all return except the man whom you seek, all the people will be at peace.”","Inh gô chông ba đĭ-đăng kon pơlei pơla wih tơ ih; mưh lu sư wih brŏk đĭ, lăp minh 'nu mă ih oei druh chă noh đĕch; na đĭ-đăng kon pơlei pơla gô đei tơdrong hiôk rơnŭk.”"
"And the saying pleased Absalom and all the elders of Israel.","Apsalôm păng lu bơngai kră Isơrael iŏk kiơ̆ nơ̆r noh khan 'lơ̆ng."
"Then Absalom said, “Now call Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear what he says too.”","Mă-lei Apsalôm khan: “Athei krao Husai, bơngai Arkit hai mơ̆n, wă kơ lu bơ̆n kư̆m mơ̆ng lăng nơ̆r sư pơma.”"
"And when Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him, saying, “Ahithophel has spoken in this manner. Shall we do as he says? If not, speak up.”","Lăp Husai mơ̆t lăm hnam, na Apsalôm roi kơ sư: “Ahithôphel pơđâu thoi âu; lu bơ̆n wă pơm kiơ̆ nơ̆r sư ưh? Dah ưh apinh ih khan lăng liơ?”"
"So Hushai said to Absalom: “The advice that Ahithophel has given is not good at this time.","Husai tơl: Nơ̆r pơma pơđâu Ahithôphel dĭng 'nâu ưh kơ 'lơ̆ng ôh."
"For,” said Hushai, “you know your father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are enraged in their minds, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field; and your father is a man of war, and will not camp with the people.","Husai pơma dơ̆ng: Ih băt boih, pơtao 'bă păng lu bơngai kiơ̆ sư jơ̆ lu bơngai nuih pran kơtang, đei jơhngơ̆m tơtŏ, blĕk dêh thoi kơ chơgơu yŏng tơ bri mă đe rôp kon sư. Hloh kơ noh dơ̆ng pơtao 'bă jơ̆ minh 'nu bơngai juăt kơ tơblah wang, kơmăng sư ưh kơ 'bĭch hơdai hăm lu linh ôh."
"Surely by now he is hidden in some pit, or in some other place. And it will be, when some of them are overthrown at the first, that whoever hears it will say, ‘There is a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom.’","Băt dang ei sư oei ôn lăm trôm hơgơp ayơ dah lăm anih ayơ nai. Tơdah đei bơngai lăm khŭl bơ̆n lôch 'bơ̆t năr tơblah blŭng-a, bu bu kơtơ̆ng kư̆m gô khan: ‘Khŭl linh kiơ̆ Apsalôm thuơ boih.’"
"And even he who is valiant, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will melt completely. For all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and those who are with him are valiant men.","Kơplah noh, lu bơngai nuih kơtang đei jơhngơ̆m thoi Dăm-brang kư̆m hli tơrơ tơtơ̆; yua kơ đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael băt kơ pơtao 'bă ih jơ̆ minh 'nu bơngai tơblah hơgei păng lu bơngai kiơ̆ sư tă kơ đei jơhngơ̆m nuih pran ngăl."
"Therefore I advise that all Israel be fully gathered to you, from Dan to Beersheba, like the sand that is by the sea for multitude, and that you go to battle in person.","“Na inh pơđâu khan kơ bơ̆n athei krao akŭm đĭ-đăng linh lăm kon pơlei Isơrael, iŏk ba dơ̆ng pơlei Đan truh tơ Bêrsêba, akŭm jum dăr kơ ih, lơ thoi chuơh đak dơsĭ, na ih kơdih gô pơgơ̆r lu sư năm tơblah."
"So we will come upon him in some place where he may be found, and we will fall on him as the dew falls on the ground. And of him and all the men who are with him there shall not be left so much as one.","Lu bơ̆n gô năm blah Đawit, mă sư oei tơ anih ayơ, lu bơ̆n gô bruh tơ kơpal sư thoi tŭk jur tơ kơpal teh; na sư păng bơngai kiơ̆ sư ưh kơ đei bu gơh klaih."
"Moreover, if he has withdrawn into a city, then all Israel shall bring ropes to that city; and we will pull it into the river, until there is not one small stone found there.”","Tơdah sư kơdâu ôn tơ lăm pơlei ayơ, đĭ-đăng linh Isơrael gô iŏk tơlei giĕn dăng jum dăr pơlei noh, na dui pơlei noh păk hơlih tơ lăm thŭng thong, dĭng mah ưh pă đei 'bôh minh pôm tơmo hơga ayơ oei oei.”"
"So Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The advice of Hushai the Archite is better than the advice of Ahithophel.” For the LORD had purposed to defeat the good advice of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring disaster on Absalom.","Apsalôm păng đĭ-đăng kon pơlei Isơrael tă kơ lăp ngăl khan tơdrong tơchĕng chă đon Husai, bơngai Arkit, hơgei hloh kơ tơdrong tơchĕng Ahithôphel. Yua kơ Kră Yang pơrăm lê̆ tơdrong tơchĕng gơh hơgei Ahithôphel, wă tuh tơdrong pơmat-tat ăn kơ Apsalôm."
"Then Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, “Thus and so Ahithophel advised Absalom and the elders of Israel, and thus and so I have advised.","Husai roi ăn kơ bre 'bok soi Sađŏk păng Abiathar mơ̆ng khan: “Ahithôphel pơđâu thoi âu hăm Apsalôm păng lu kră bơngai Isơrael, na inh kư̆m đei pơđâu thoi âu"
"Now therefore, send quickly and tell David, saying, ‘Do not spend this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily cross over, lest the king and all the people who are with him be swallowed up.’ ”","Na dang ei măr iĕm wơh bơngai jah năm roi tơbăt kơ Đawit: ‘'Nĕ pơdơh kơmăng 'bơ̆t glung đơng tơnŏk juăt kơ tŏk năm tơ char glă; athei tŏk năm hloi, kơnh hli kơ pơtao păng lu bơngai kiơ̆ pơtao đe gô pơlôch.’ ”"
"Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed at En Rogel, for they dared not be seen coming into the city; so a female servant would come and tell them, and they would go and tell King David.","Jônathan păng Ahimaas dơ̆ng gô tơ đak glung Ên Rôgel, đei minh 'nu bơngai drŏ-kăn juăt kơ năm roi tơbăt ăn kơ lu sư, na bre sư roi ăn kơ Đawit.

"Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom. But both of them went away quickly and came to a man’s house in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down into it.","Mă-lei đei minh 'nu bơngai tơdăm 'bôh bre sư, na năm roi hloi kơ Apsalôm băt.

"Then the woman took and spread a covering over the well’s mouth, and spread ground grain on it; and the thing was not known.","Akăn 'bok 'nâu iŏk minh blah 'bi tơsu klơ̆p lê̆ 'bơ̆r đak sơlŭng, đơ̆ng noh sư tuh 'ba tơ'bâu sơ̆k kơpal noh, wă kơ đe ưh kơ băt."
"And when Absalom’s servants came to the woman at the house, they said, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” So the woman said to them, “They have gone over the water brook.” And when they had searched and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.","Lu đĭch đam Apsalôm năm tơ hnam bơngai drŏ-kăn 'nâu na jet khan: “Ahimaas păng Jônathan tơ yơ?” Bơngai drŏ-kăn ei tơl khan: “'Bar 'nu bre sư năm tŏk hlôi kơ đak glung boih.” Lu linh druh kiơ̆ chơchă, mă-lei ưh kơ đei tơ'bơ̆p, na wih dơ̆ng tơ Jêrusalem."
"Now it came to pass, after they had departed, that they came up out of the well and went and told King David, and said to David, “Arise and cross over the water quickly. For thus has Ahithophel advised against you.”","Wă lu sư năm hloh boih, Ahimaas păng Jônathan tŏk đơ̆ng đak sơlŭng, đơ̆ng noh năm tơbăt tơdrong 'nâu ăn kơ Đawit: “Apinh pơtao păng lu bơngai bơ̆jang hăm ih, iung bĕ, mă tĕnh jah năm tŏk hlôi kơ đak Krong, yua kơ Ahithôphel pơđâu wă pơrăm ih:”"
"So David and all the people who were with him arose and crossed over the Jordan. By morning light not one of them was left who had not gone over the Jordan.","Đawit păng đĭ-đăng lu bơngai kiơ̆ sư tŏk hlôi kơ đak Krong Jôrđăn. Lăp 'brưch hơdah pơgê ưh pă đei minh 'nu bơngai bu mă ưh tam tŏk hlôi kơ đak Krong."
"Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to his city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died; and he was buried in his father’s tomb.","Ahithôphel 'bôh đe ưh kơ wă kiơ̆ tơdrong sư pơđâu, na hao hloi aseh iĕ sư brŏk tơ hnam pơlei sư kơdih tơ Gilô.

"Then David went to Mahanaim. And Absalom crossed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.","Đawit năm truh tơ pơlei Mahanaim, kơplah noh Apsalôm năm hăm đĭ-đăng lu linh Isơrael kiơ̆ sư tŏk hlôi kơ đak Krong Jôrđăn."
"And Absalom made Amasa captain of the army instead of Joab. This Amasa was the son of a man whose name was Jithra, an Israelite, who had gone in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister of Zeruiah, Joab’s mother.","Apsalôm pôk Amasa pơm yŏng linh pơtrơp đơ̆ng Jôap.

"So Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.","Khŭl bơngai Isơrael păng Apsalôm pơm kơđông pơdơh lăm dêh char Gileat."
"Now it happened, when David had come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the people of Ammon, Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo Debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim","Lăp pơtao Đawit truh tơ pơlei Mahanaim, na Sôbi kon drŏ-nglo Nahas đơ̆ng pơlei Rapba kon pơlei Ammôn Makir kon drŏ-nglo Ammiel đơ̆ng pơlei Lôdêbar păng Barsilai bơngai Gileat đơ̆ng pơlei Rôgelim"
"brought beds and basins, earthen vessels and wheat, barley and flour, parched grain and beans, lentils and parched seeds","chĕp ba ăn kơ Đawit păng kơ đĭ-đăng bơngai kiơ̆ sư. Lu hơkok, pơnhan, lu bô̆i teh, 'ba mi, 'ba tơ'bâu, tơpŭng, găr hơdrĕng, lơ găr tơh, păng lơ găr hơdrĕng nai"
"honey and curds, sheep and cheese of the herd, for David and the people who were with him to eat. For they said, “The people are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness.”","đak sut, đak toh iŭ, triu păng 'bĕng đak toh rơmo, wă ăn kơ Đawit păng lu linh sư sa, yua kơ lu sư băt kon pơlei ơ̆t ưh kơ đei por ol kơ đak păng gleh glăn pơmat-tat dêh lăm char glă."
"And David numbered the people who were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.","Đawit jô̆ pơnhen lu linh năm kiơ̆ sư, ăn yŏng pơgơ̆r wei lu linh sư. Minh khŭl minh-rơbâu, minh khŭl minh-hrĕng 'nu."
"Then David sent out one third of the people under the hand of Joab, one third under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and one third under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the people, “I also will surely go out with you myself.”","Đawit gơih khŭl linh sư năm. Klah asong pêng khŭl, ăn kơ Jôap iŏk pơgơ̆r minh khŭl.

"But the people answered, “You shall not go out! For if we flee away, they will not care about us; nor if half of us die, will they care about us. But you are worth ten thousand of us now. For you are now more help to us in the city.”","Mă-lei khŭl linh khan: “Pơtao ih 'nĕ kơ năm yua kơ mă lu nhôn thuơ kơdâu, bơngai ayăt ưh kơ gan hiơ̆k kơ lu nhôn, păng mă khan minh puăt lu nhôn lôch lu sư kư̆m ưh kơ hơlen ôh; mă-lei minh 'nu ih gĭt dang mơjĭt-rơbâu 'nu lu nhôn.

"Then the king said to them, “Whatever seems best to you I will do.” So the king stood beside the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.","Pơtao drơ̆ng: “Ơ, inh gô pơm kiơ̆ lu iĕm 'bôh khan 'lơ̆ng.” Na, pơtao dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t 'măng jang pơlei, kơplah khŭl linh lĕch năm kiơ̆ kơ khŭl minh-hrĕng khŭl minh-rơbâu"
"Now the king had commanded Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, saying, “Deal gently for my sake with the young man Absalom.” And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains orders concerning Absalom.","pơtao jao pơkă ăn kơ Jôap, Abisai, păng Itai: “Yua kơ inh, iĕm athei pơm kơ kon inh Apsalôm lăp ai.” Đĭ-đăng khŭl linh kơtơ̆ng nơ̆r pơtao pơkă kơ bơngai chĕp kơ̆l, gah Apsalôm."
"So the people went out into the field of battle against Israel. And the battle was in the woods of Ephraim.","Khŭl linh lĕch tơ chŭn, sơng tơblah hăm lu linh Isơrael, na tơblah tơ lăm bri Êphraim."
"The people of Israel were overthrown there before the servants of David, and a great slaughter of twenty thousand took place there that day.","Khŭl linh pơtao Đawit blah pơrăm lê̆ khŭl linh Isơrael tơ noh; khŭl linh Isơrael thuơ tih dêh. Lăm năr noh, lôch 'bar-jĭt rơbâu 'nu bơngai."

"Then Absalom met the servants of David. Absalom rode on a mule. The mule went under the thick boughs of a great terebinth tree, and his head caught in the terebinth; so he was left hanging between heaven and earth. And the mule which was under him went on.","Lu đĭch đam Đawit tơ'bơ̆p Apsalôm sư hao aseh iĕ.

"Now a certain man saw it and told Joab, and said, “I just saw Absalom hanging in a terebinth tree!”","Đei bơngai 'bôh, năm roi tơbăt kơ Jôap: “Inh 'bôh Apsalôm sư đom kơpal dơng 'long kôih.”"
"So Joab said to the man who told him, “You just saw him! And why did you not strike him there to the ground? I would have given you ten shekels of silver and a belt.”","Jôap tơl: “Kiơ ih 'bôh sư ah?

"But the man said to Joab, “Though I were to receive a thousand shekels of silver in my hand, I would not raise my hand against the king’s son. For in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, ‘Beware lest anyone touch the young man Absalom!’","Mă-lei bơngai ei khan: “Mă khan ih đei ăn chĕp lăm tơpang ti inh minh-rơbâu hlak jên hu, inh kư̆m ưh kơ pơ̆n pơrăm kon pơtao; yua kơ lu nhôn đei kơtơ̆ng pơtao pơkă pơkăm kơ ih, Abisai păng Itai khan: ‘Iĕm lăng hŏ, 'nĕ ăn bơngai bu pơrăm Apsalôm, kon tơdăm inh.’"
"Otherwise I would have dealt falsely against my own life. For there is nothing hidden from the king, and you yourself would have set yourself against me.”","Tơdah inh pơm kơnê̆ na pơlôch Apsalôm, lei ưh kơ gơh ôn hlơp kơ pơtao; mă ih kư̆m gô dơ̆ng tơ ataih, ưh kơ pơ̆n wă dŏng inh ôh!”"
"Then Joab said, “I cannot linger with you.” And he took three spears in his hand and thrust them through Absalom’s heart, while he was still alive in the midst of the terebinth tree.","Jôap tơl: “Inh ưh kơ wă gô mơ̆ng dâu ôh,” sư chĕp pêng hlak hơlă 'bet hloi plei nuih Apsalôm, 'bơ̆t sư oei arih đom kơpal dơng 'long kôih."
"And ten young men who bore Joab’s armor surrounded Absalom, and struck and killed him.","Mơjĭt 'nu bơngai tơdăm chĕp đao hơlă Jôap wang tăp kơ Apsalôm păng teh pơlôch sư."
"So Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing Israel. For Joab held back the people.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ noh Jôap hlôm tơgiĕp, kon pơlei ưh pă druh linh Isơrael dơ̆ng, yua kơ Jôap athei lu sư lê̆."
"And they took Absalom and cast him into a large pit in the woods, and laid a very large heap of stones over him. Then all Israel fled, everyone to his tent.","Đe iŏk akâu Apsalôm klơ̆m lê̆ tơ lăm sơlŭng jrŭ tơ lăm bri, na dan hơdrom tơmo tơ kơpal sư minh pôi tih.

"Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up a pillar for himself, which is in the King’s Valley. For he said, “I have no son to keep my name in remembrance.” He called the pillar after his own name. And to this day it is called Absalom’s Monument.","Apsalôm kơplah oei arih sư đei man pơdơ̆ng kơ sư minh pôm gơ̆ng tơmo tơ lăm thŭng pơtao; yua kơ sư tơchĕng khan: “Inh ưh kơ đei kon drŏ-nglo wă pơtrơp anăn inh.” Gơ̆ng noh krao kiơ̆ kơ anăn sư; truh kơ dang ei đe oei krao, “Gơ̆ng tơmo Apsalôm.”"
"Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, “Let me run now and take the news to the king, how the LORD has avenged him of his enemies.”","Ahimatas, kon drŏ-nglo 'bok soi Sađŏk, khan kơ Jôap: “Apinh ih ăn kơ inh kơdâu roi tơbăt ăn kơ pơtao tơdrong 'nâu, Kră Yang đei hơmet dŏng pơklaih ih đơ̆ng bơngai ayăt kơ ih.”"
"And Joab said to him, “You shall not take the news this day, for you shall take the news another day. But today you shall take no news, because the king’s son is dead.”","Jôap tơl: “Dang ei ih ưh kơ trŏ kơ bơngai năm roi tơdrong 'nâu ôh, gô năr nai ih gơh năm roi, năr 'nâu ih lê̆ kơ năm roi, yua kơ kon pơtao lôch boih.”"
"Then Joab said to the Cushite, “Go, tell the king what you have seen.” So the Cushite bowed himself to Joab and ran.","Jôap khan kơ linh bơngai Kus: “Năm roi ăn kơ pơtao bĕ tơdrong kiơ ih 'bôh.” Bơngai Kus drap kơkuh kơ Jôap, klaih kơ noh sư năm."
"And Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said again to Joab, “But whatever happens, please let me also run after the Cushite.” So Joab said, “Why will you run, my son, since you have no news ready?”","Ahimaas, kon drŏ-nglo 'bok soi Sađŏk pơma lung Jôap dơ̆ng: “Mă đei tơdrong kiơ truh, ăn kơ inh druh kiơ̆ đơ̆ng rŏng đơ̆ng rŏng bơngai Kus.” Jôap khan dơ̆ng: “Ơ kon, yua kơ kiơ kon 'maih năm roi dêh?

"“But whatever happens,” he said, “let me run.” So he said to him, “Run.” Then Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain, and outran the Cushite.","Ahimaas lung dơ̆ng: “Mă đơ̆ng thoi yơ, inh 'maih năm roi,” Jôap khan kơ sư: “Kơdâu năm bĕ.” Lei na Ahimaas kơdâu trong dăr kơthŭng dơnă Krong Jôrđăn păng kơdâu năm ploi adrol kơ bơngai Kus."
"Now David was sitting between the two gates. And the watchman went up to the roof over the gate, to the wall, lifted his eyes and looked, and there was a man, running alone.","Pơtao Đawit oei ngôi 'bơ̆t măng jang pơlei tŏk-bŏk 'măng jang lăm păng 'măng jang 'nguaih.

"Then the watchman cried out and told the king. And the king said, “If he is alone, there is news in his mouth.” And he came rapidly and drew near.","Linh gak ôr re roi tơbăt ăn kơ pơtao. Pơtao khan: “Tơdah sư kơdâu minh 'nu, lei trŏ kơ bơngai năm roi tơbăt tơdrong truh.” Lăp sư kơdâu wă jê̆ truh"
"Then the watchman saw another man running, and the watchman called to the gatekeeper and said, “There is another man, running alone!” And the king said, “He also brings news.”","linh gak ei 'bôh minh 'nu bơngai nai dơ̆ng kư̆m kơdâu, na krao ôr hloi bơngai răp gak 'măng khan: “To đei dơ̆ng minh 'nu bơngai oei kơdâu!” Pơtao khan: “Sư kư̆m năm roi tơdrong 'nao mơ̆n.”"
"So the watchman said, “I think the running of the first is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.” And the king said, “He is a good man, and comes with good news.”","Linh gak khan: “Inh 'bôh bơngai kơdâu adrol nhen Ahimaas, kon drŏ-nglo 'bok soi Sađŏk.” Pơtao khan: “Noh jơ̆ minh 'nu bơngai 'lơ̆ng, sư boih bơngai ba tơdrong 'lơ̆ng 'nao.”"
"So Ahimaaz called out and said to the king, “All is well!” Then he bowed down with his face to the earth before the king, and said, “Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delivered up the men who raised their hand against my lord the king!”","Ahimaas krao hloi pơtao păng khan: “Kơkuh kơ pơtao dôm tơdrong hiôk-hian!” Na sư drap kơkuh 'bơ̆t anăp pơtao păng khan: “Bơnê ư-ang kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei pơtao, yua kơ Sư dŏng pơklaih boih pơtao đơ̆ng lu bơngai blah pơtao yŏng tơ'ngla inh!”"
"The king said, “Is the young man Absalom safe?” Ahimaaz answered, “When Joab sent the king’s servant and me your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I did not know what it was about.”","Pơtao jet: “Apsalôm kon tơdăm inh, hăm oei 'lơ̆ng akâu ưh?” Ahimaas tơl: “Lăp Jôap đĭch đam ih, wơh đĭch ih inh âu boih năm, na inh đei 'bôh lơ tơpôl ơ-ôs ơ-as, mă-lei inh ưh kơ băt đei tơdrong kiơ truh.”"
"And the king said, “Turn aside and stand here.” So he turned aside and stood still.","Pơtao khan kơ sư: “Kơdŭn păng dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t doh.” Sư kơdŭn hloi păng gô."
"Just then the Cushite came, and the Cushite said, “There is good news, my lord the king! For the LORD has avenged you this day of all those who rose against you.”","Bơngai Kus truh hloi păng khan: “'Nâu jơ̆ minh tơdrong 'nao tơbăt ăn kơ pơtao păng yŏng tơ'ngla inh.

"And the king said to the Cushite, “Is the young man Absalom safe?” So the Cushite answered, “May the enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise against you to do harm, be like that young man!”","Pơtao jet bơngai Kus: “Apsalôm kon tơdăm inh, hăm oei 'lơ̆ng akâu ưh?” Bơngai Kus tơl: “Rŏ kơ lu bơngai ayăt pơtao yŏng tơ'ngla inh, păng đĭ-đăng lu bơngai ayơ ayăt wă pơrăm pơtao; rŏ kơ kư̆m thoi tơdăm noh!”"
"Then the king was deeply moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept. And as he went, he said thus: “O my son Absalom—my son, my son Absalom—if only I had died in your place! O Absalom my son, my son!”","Pơtao Đawit 'mêm kơ kon tơdăm sư dêh, na tŏk hloi tơ kơpal 'măng jang pơlei păng nhơ̆m hmoi sư năm rah pơma rah khan: “Ơ, Apsalôm, kon dăm inh! Kon dăm inh!

"And Joab was told, “Behold, the king is weeping and mourning for Absalom.”","Đe năm roi ăn kơ Jôap: “Pơtao nhơ̆m hmoi dêh ơh 'mêm kơ Apsalôm”"
"So the victory that day was turned into mourning for all the people. For the people heard it said that day, “The king is grieved for his son.”","Lăm năr tơdrong sư tơblah jei, tơplih jing tơdrong ơh sơ'ngon kơ đĭ-đăng kon pơlei pơla, yua kơ kon pơlei pơla kơtơ̆ng ang khan pơtao nhơ̆m hmoi ơh sơ'ngon 'mêm kơ kon sư."
"And the people stole back into the city that day, as people who are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.","Lăm năr noh khŭl linh klen klon mơ̆t lăm pơlei nhen thoi lu khŭl linh mơlâu klen klon kơdâu ôn đơ̆ng tơblah."
"But the king covered his face, and the king cried out with a loud voice, “O my son Absalom! O Absalom, my son, my son!”","Kơplah noh pơtao gom muh măt hmoi ôr re khan: “Ơ Apsalôm kon dăm inh! Ơ Apsalôm kon dăm inh! Kon dăm inh!”"
"Then Joab came into the house to the king, and said, “Today you have disgraced all your servants who today have saved your life, the lives of your sons and daughters, the lives of your wives and the lives of your concubines","Jôap mơ̆t lăm hnam pơtao păng khan: “Năr 'nâu pơtao pơm ăn kơ đĭ-đăng lu đĭch đam ih mơlâu, jơ̆ lu bơngai noh boih mă dŏng pơklaih tơdrong arih pơtao, lu kon drŏ-nglo drŏ-kăn pơtao, hăm dŏng pơklaih đĭ-đăng tơdrong arih lu akăn tơm păng lu akăn kơnhŏng ih hai mơ̆n."
"in that you love your enemies and hate your friends. For you have declared today that you regard neither princes nor servants; for today I perceive that if Absalom had lived and all of us had died today, then it would have pleased you well.","Na, ih 'mêm kơ lu bơngai areh kơ ih na areh kơ lu bơngai mă 'mêm kơ ih!

"Now therefore, arise, go out and speak comfort to your servants. For I swear by the LORD, if you do not go out, not one will stay with you this night. And that will be worse for you than all the evil that has befallen you from your youth until now.”","Thoi noh dang ei pơtao jah iung bĕ, năm pơma pơlung jơhngơ̆m lu đĭch đam ih hloi; inh pao anăn Kră Yang na pơkă, tơdah pơtao ưh kơ năm pơlung, lei lăm măng 'nâu ưh kơ đei minh 'nu bơngai bu oei hơdai hăm ih; păng noh boih tơdrong gô truh pơmat trăp hloh kơ lu tơdrong đei truh kơ pơtao mă đơ̆ng kơplah oei 'lơ̆p sơ̆ truh kơ dang ei.”"
"Then the king arose and sat in the gate. And they told all the people, saying, “There is the king, sitting in the gate.” So all the people came before the king. For everyone of Israel had fled to his tent.","Pơtao iung lĕch ngôi 'bơ̆t 'măng jang pơlei. Đĭ-đăng kon pơlei pơla băt khan pơtao ngôi 'bơ̆t 'măng jang pơlei, na pơma dơnuh hăm pơtao.

"Now all the people were in a dispute throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “The king saved us from the hand of our enemies, he delivered us from the hand of the Philistines, and now he has fled from the land because of Absalom.","Lăm lu adrĕch adrung Isơrael lu sư pơđâu băl khan: “Pơtao dŏng pơklaih boih lu bơ̆n đơ̆ng ti bơngai ayăt kơ lu bơ̆n, păng sư đei pơklaih lu bơ̆n đơ̆ng ti lu bơngai Philistin.

"But Absalom, whom we anointed over us, has died in battle. Now therefore, why do you say nothing about bringing back the king?”","Na Apsalôm mă lu bơ̆n tuh boih đak pơgang 'bâu phu pôk pơm pơtao lu bơ̆n, dang ei lôch boih. Lei na, dang ei liơ lu bơ̆n ưh kơ pơma pơđâu pơtơm pơtao brŏk?”"
"So King David sent to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, saying, “Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, ‘Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house, since the words of all Israel have come to the king, to his very house?","Nơ̆r đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael pơma băl gah tơdrong sơng iŏk pơtao brŏk kơtơ̆ng truh tơ pơtao boih; pơtao Đawit wơh bơngai năm tơ bre 'bok soi, Sađŏk, păng Abiathar: “Măr iĕm khan bĕ kơ lu bơngai kră Juđa: ‘Liơ mă tă tơ lu iĕm jing bơngai tuch-luch năm krao pơtơm pơtao brŏk tơ hnam sư?’"
"You are my brethren, you are my bone and my flesh. Why then are you the last to bring back the king?’","Lu iĕm jơ̆ 'nhŏng oh inh, jơ̆ sĕch akar inh! Liơ mă lu iĕm jing tă tơ bơngai tuch-luch krao pơtơm pơtao brŏk?"

"So he swayed the hearts of all the men of Judah, just as the heart of one man, so that they sent this word to the king: “Return, you and all your servants!”","Pơtao Đawit pơm lăp đon kơ đĭ-đăng bơngai Juđa, lu sư minh jơhngơ̆m đon wơh bơngai năm wơ̆n pơtao: “Apinh pơtao hăm đĭ-đăng đĭch đam pơtao wih brŏk bĕ.”"
"Then the king returned and came to the Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to escort the king across the Jordan.","Na pơtao iung brŏk truh 'bơ̆t đak Krong Jôrđăn. Lu bơngai Juđa kư̆m năm truh sơng iŏk pơtao 'bơ̆t Gilgal wă ba pơtao năm tŏk hlôi kơ đak Krong Jôrđăn."
"And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, who was from Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet King David.","Simêi, kon drŏ-nglo Gêra, bơngai Bênjamin oei tơ Bahurim, hăt hot năm jur hăm lu bơngai Juđa wă sơng pơtao Đawit."
"There were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over the Jordan before the king.","Simêi chông ba minh-rơbâu 'nu bơngai Bênjamin kiơ̆ sư.

"Then a ferryboat went across to carry over the king’s household, and to do what he thought good.

"But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, “Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD’s anointed?”","Abisai, kon drŏ-nglo Sêruia, tơl khan: “Simêi ưh kơ trŏ pơlôch sư yua kơ tơdrong noh hă? Sư bơngai hiap pơtê̆ tơ'ngla mă Kră Yang rơih iŏk!”"
"And David said, “What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should be adversaries to me today? Shall any man be put to death today in Israel?

"Therefore the king said to Shimei, “You shall not die.” And the king swore to him.","Pơtao pơkă hăm Simêi: “Ih ưh kơ đei lôch ôh.”"
"Now Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king. And he had not cared for his feet, nor trimmed his mustache, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he returned in peace.","Mephibôset sâu drŏ-nglo Sôl, kư̆m năm jur sơng pơtao, sư ưh kơ đei ôp jơ̆ng, yuă sŏk kang dah pih hơbĕn ao sư iŏk đơ̆ng năr pơtao yak năm truh tơ năr pơtao wih brŏk hiôk-hian."
"So it was, when he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said to him, “Why did you not go with me, Mephibosheth?”","Kơplah sư đơ̆ng pơlei Jêrusalem năm sơng pơtao, Đawit jet sư: “Ơ, Mephibôset, liơ ih ưh kơ năm hăm inh?”"

"For all my father’s house were but dead men before my lord the king. Yet you set your servant among those who eat at your own table.

"Please let your servant turn back again, that I may die in my own city, near the grave of my father and mother. But here is your servant Chimham; let him cross over with my lord the king, and do for him what seems good to you.”","Apinh ăn kơ inh brŏk, wă kơ inh lôch lăm pơlei inh, jê̆ bơsat mĕ 'bă inh, mă-lei đei Kimham âu, đĭch đam ih; ăn kơ sư kiơ̆ ih yŏng tơ'ngla inh, păng apinh ih wei rong sư kiơ̆ kơ ih tơchĕng.”"
"And the king answered, “Chimham shall cross over with me, and I will do for him what seems good to you. Now whatever you request of me, I will do for you.”","Pơtao tơl: “Kimham gô năm kiơ̆, păng inh gô rong ba sư kiơ̆ kơ ih wă. Ih apinh inh tơdrong kiơ, inh gô ăn kơ ih.”"
"Then all the people went over the Jordan. And when the king had crossed over, the king kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and he returned to his own place.","Na đĭ-đăng linh păng kon pơlei tŏk găn kơ đak Krong Jôrđăn, pơtao kư̆m tŏk, pơtao chŭm Barsilai păng tơklah băl. Barsilai wih tơ pơlei sư kơdih."
"Now the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him. And all the people of Judah escorted the king, and also half the people of Israel.","Đơ̆ng noh pơtao năm truh tơ pơlei Gilgal. Kimham kư̆m năm, đĭ-đăng kon pơlei Juđa, păng hloh kơ minh puăt kon pơlei Isơrael kư̆m năm kiơ̆ ba pơtao."
"Just then all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king, “Why have our brethren, the men of Judah, stolen you away and brought the king, his household, and all David’s men with him across the Jordan?”","Đĭ-đăng lu bơngai Isơrael năm jet pơtao: “Liơ 'nhŏng oh lu nhôn bơngai Juđa klĕnh chông ba ih, hnam dơnŏ ih păng đĭ-đăng bơngai kiơ̆ ih tŏk kơ đak Krong Jôrđăn?”"
"So all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, “Because the king is a close relative of ours. Why then are you angry over this matter? Have we ever eaten at the king’s expense? Or has he given us any gift?”","Bơngai Juđa tơl: “Yua kơ lu nhôn 'nhŏng oh hăm pơtao. Na liơ mă lu iĕm blĕk? Lu nhôn đei sa yua tơmam kiơ đơ̆ng pơtao ưh? Pơtao hăm đei ăn đĕch kơ lu nhôn tơmam kiơ?”"
"And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, “We have ten shares in the king; therefore we also have more right to David than you. Why then do you despise us—were we not the first to advise bringing back our king?” Yet the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.","Bơngai Isơrael tơl bơngai Juđa: “Lu nhôn hăm hnam pơtao 'bơm hloh kơ lu iĕm mơjĭt wơ̆t, na gah Đawit lu nhôn jê̆ hloh kơ lu iĕm; na liơ mă lu iĕm klai kơ lu nhôn?

"And there happened to be there a rebel, whose name was Sheba the son of Bichri, a Benjamite. And he blew a trumpet, and said: “We have no share in David, Nor do we have inheritance in the son of Jesse; Every man to his tents, O Israel!”","Tơ noh đei minh 'nu bơngai pơm pơrŭng, anăn sư Seba, kon drŏ-nglo Bikri, bơngai Bênjamin; Seba hlôm keng păng krao: “Lu bơ̆n ưh kơ đei kiơ gah Đawit, kư̆m ưh kơ đei yua kiơ hăm kon drŏ-nglo Jese! Ơ 'nhŏng oh Isơrael, rim 'nu athei brŏk tơ hnam kơdih”"
"So every man of Israel deserted David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri. But the men of Judah, from the Jordan as far as Jerusalem, remained loyal to their king.","Đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael achăng lê̆ pơtao Đawit, kiơ̆ Seba kon drŏ-nglo Bikri; mă-lei bơngai Juđa oei kơjăp hăm pơtao sư kơdih, năm kiơ̆ pơtao đơ̆ng đak Krong Jôrđăn brŏk tơ Jêrusalem."
"Now David came to his house at Jerusalem. And the king took the ten women, his concubines whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in seclusion and supported them, but did not go in to them. So they were shut up to the day of their death, living in widowhood.","Lăp Đawit brŏk tơ hnam pơtao sư tơ pơlei Jêrusalem boih pơtao wơh bơngai chă mơjĭt 'nu akăn kơnhŏng pơtao lê̆ kơ lu sư wei-lăng hnam pơtao ki, pơtao ăn kơ lu sư oei minh pôm hnam đei bơngai wei-lăng; pơtao ăn kơ lu sư tơmam sa mă-lei ưh kơ đei oei hơdai hăm lu sư.

"And the king said to Amasa, “Assemble the men of Judah for me within three days, and be present here yourself.”","Pơtao khan kơ Amasa: “Inh ăn kơ ih lăm pêng năr wă krao akŭm lu linh Juđa năm tơ inh âu.”"
"So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah. But he delayed longer than the set time which David had appointed him.","Amasa năm krao akŭm lu linh Juđa, mă-lei sư pơhiơ̆, hloh kơ năr pơtao pơkă."
"And David said to Abishai, “Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom. Take your lord’s servants and pursue him, lest he find for himself fortified cities, and escape us.”","Na, pơtao Đawit khan kơ Abisai: “Seba, kon Bikri, wă pơrăm lu bơ̆n hơmơt hloh kơ Apsalôm. Na ih athei anhăk lu linh inh, druh 'moi Seba kơnh sư tơgar iŏk pơlei ayơ kơjăp đơ̆ng lu bơ̆n.”"
"So Joab’s men, with the Cherethites, the Pelethites, and all the mighty men, went out after him. And they went out of Jerusalem to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.","Abisai pơgơ̆r linh Jôap, khŭl linh sư bơngai Kêrêthit; păng bơngai Phêlêthit păng đĭ-đăng lu bơngai nuih kơtang lĕch dơ̆ng pơlei Jêrusalem, druh 'moi Sêba, kon Bikri."
"When they were at the large stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came before them. Now Joab was dressed in battle armor; on it was a belt with a sword fastened in its sheath at his hips; and as he was going forward, it fell out.","Lăp lu sư năm jê̆ tơmo tih tơ pơlei Gibeôn na tơ'bơ̆p Amasa năm tơ lu sư, kơplah noh Jôap hrŭk ao linh; tơ kơiĕng đei kiĕo minh hlak đao gưm tah lăm hơnglop.

"Then Joab said to Amasa, “Are you in health, my brother?” And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.","Jôap kơkuh kơ Amasa. “Ih hăm liĕm akâu?” Ti gah 'ma sư rôp sŏk kang Amasa wă chŭm sư."
"But Amasa did not notice the sword that was in Joab’s hand. And he struck him with it in the stomach, and his entrails poured out on the ground; and he did not strike him again. Thus he died. Then Joab and Abishai his brother pursued Sheba the son of Bichri.","Mă-lei Amasa ưh kơ đei 'bôh ôh đao tơ ti gah 'ngiĕo Jôap, iŏk đao 'bet hloi klak Amasa, klak Amasa lĕch tơ teh, na sư lôch.

"Meanwhile one of Joab’s men stood near Amasa, and said, “Whoever favors Joab and whoever is for David—follow Joab!”","Minh 'nu bơngai linh Jôap dơ̆ng jê̆ akâu Amasa lôch, khan: “Bơngai bu 'mêm kơ Jôap păng gah Đawit, kiơ̆ Jôap bĕ.”"
"But Amasa wallowed in his blood in the middle of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he moved Amasa from the highway to the field and threw a garment over him, when he saw that everyone who came upon him halted.","Mă-lei sư 'bôh đĭ-đăng khŭl linh dơ̆ng ngăl, yua kơ akâu Amasa lôch pham lĕch 'bĕnh oei lê̆ tŏk-bŏk trong tih.

"When he was removed from the highway, all the people went on after Joab to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.","Lăp akâu lôch noh dui lê̆ tơ jih kơ trong tih boih đĭ-đăng bơngai năm kiơ̆ Jôap druh 'moi Sêba, kon Bikri."
"And he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel and Beth Maachah and all the Berites. So they were gathered together and also went after Sheba.","Seba năm hlôi jơ̆p kơ tơring lu adrĕch adrung Isơrael. Truh tơ pơlei Abel lăm Bet Maaka păng đĭ-đăng lu bơngai lăm adrĕch Bikri kư̆m năm kiơ̆ Seba."
"Then they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth Maachah; and they cast up a siege mound against the city, and it stood by the rampart. And all the people who were with Joab battered the wall to throw it down.","Na, đĭ-đăng lu linh Jôap lu sư truh wang Seba lăm pơlei Abel tơ Bet Maaka, lu sư năm pơm kơđông jê̆ dur 'nguaih păng oei sir wă kơ dur pơlei păk hơlih."
"Then a wise woman cried out from the city, “Hear, hear! Please say to Joab, ‘Come nearby, that I may speak with you.’ ”","Đei minh 'nu bơngai drŏ-kăn gơh hơgei dơ̆ng kơpal dur pơlei krao dơ'lông tơ ala: “Mơ̆ng bĕ, mơ̆ng bĕ! Apinh krao Jôap năm jê̆ tơ âu, inh wă pơma dơnuh hăm sư.”"
"When he had come near to her, the woman said, “Are you Joab?” He answered, “I am.” Then she said to him, “Hear the words of your maidservant.” And he answered, “I am listening.”","Lăp Jôap truh jê̆, bơngai drŏ-kăn ei jet: “Ih hăm trŏ kơ Jôap yŏng linh ưh?” Sư tơl: “Inh âu boih.” Drŏ-kăn ei pơma dơ̆ng: “Mơ̆ng bĕ nơ̆r đam drŏ-kăn ih.” Sư tơl: “Inh mơ̆ng âu.”"
"So she spoke, saying, “They used to talk in former times, saying, ‘They shall surely seek guidance at Abel,’ and so they would end disputes.","Bơngai drŏ-kăn ei khan dơ̆ng: “Kră sơ̆ khan: ‘Athei apinh kon pơlei Abel na gơh keh tơdrong jang.’"
"I am among the peaceable and faithful in Israel. You seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel. Why would you swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?”","Lu nhôn jơ̆ bơngai oei hiôk-hian păng tơnăp lăm char Isơrael. Mă-lei ih chă đon wă pơrăm lê̆ minh pôm pơlei mĕ lăm Isơrael!

"And Joab answered and said, “Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy!","Jôap tơl: “Ưh kơ đei layơ! Ưh kơ đei layơ inh mă đei tơchĕng wă pơlôch dah pơrăm lê̆!"
"That is not so. But a man from the mountains of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has raised his hand against the king, against David. Deliver him only, and I will depart from the city.” So the woman said to Joab, “Watch, his head will be thrown to you over the wall.”","Ưh kơ trŏ thoi noh ôh!

"Then the woman in her wisdom went to all the people. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. Then he blew a trumpet, and they withdrew from the city, every man to his tent. So Joab returned to the king at Jerusalem.","Na, bơngai drŏ-kăn ei năm tơ'bơ̆p đĭ-đăng kon pơlei păng roi tơbăt tơdrong gơh hơgei sư. Lu sư chơ̆ng kơ̆l Seba, kon drŏ-nglo Bikri klơ̆m ăn kơ Jôap.

"And Joab was over all the army of Israel; Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites","Jôap pơgơ̆r đĭ-đăng lu linh Isơrael; Bênaia kon drŏ-nglo Jêhôiada pơm yŏng lu bơngai Kêrêthit păng Pêlêthit"
"Adoram was in charge of revenue; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder","Adôram pôk sư lăng gah tơdrong đe jang; Jêhôsaphat, kon drŏ-nglo Ahilut, pơm yŏng chih răk dôm tơdrong truh."
"Sheva was scribe; Zadok and Abiathar were the priests","Sêwa pơm bơngai chih hla bơar; Sađŏk păng Abiathar pơm 'bok soi."
"and Ira the Jairite was a chief minister under David.","Ira bơngai Jair pơm 'bok soi kơ pơtao Đawit."
"Now there was a famine in the days of David for three years, year after year; and David inquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, “It is because of Saul and his bloodthirsty house, because he killed the Gibeonites.”","Lăm chăl Đawit đei pơngot rơwĕt tih truh tơ pêng sơnăm.

"So the king called the Gibeonites and spoke to them. Now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; the children of Israel had sworn protection to them, but Saul had sought to kill them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah.","Bơngai Gibeôn ưh kơ trŏ gah adrĕch kon pơlei Isơrael, mă-lei lu sư adrĕch Amôrit mă oei oei.

"Therefore David said to the Gibeonites, “What shall I do for you? And with what shall I make atonement, that you may bless the inheritance of the LORD?”","Pơtao Đawit apinh bơngai Gibeôn: “Inh athei pơm kiơ kơ lu iĕm?

"And the Gibeonites said to him, “We will have no silver or gold from Saul or from his house, nor shall you kill any man in Israel for us.” So he said, “Whatever you say, I will do for you.”","Bơngai Gibeôn tơl: “Hu maih ưh kơ gơh hơmet tơdrong lu nhôn hăm pơtao Sôl păng adrĕch hnam sư.

"Then they answered the king, “As for the man who consumed us and plotted against us, that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the territories of Israel","Lu sư tơl pơtao: “Bơngai mă pơlôch lu nhôn boih, păng chă đon wă pơlôch đĭ lu nhôn dơ̆ng, wă kơ lu nhôn ưh pă đei bu oei arih lăm teh đak Isơrael."
"let seven men of his descendants be delivered to us, and we will hang them before the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, whom the LORD chose.” And the king said, “I will give them.”","Apinh pơtao pơjao ăn kơ lu nhôn tơpơh 'nu kon sâu bơngai noh, wă kơ lu nhôn hrek hơtol lu sư 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, tơ Gibêah, pơlei pơtao Sôl, pơtao mă Kră Yang rơih?” Pơtao tơl: “Inh gô jao lu sư ăn kơ lu iĕm”"
"But the king spared Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the LORD’s oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.","Pơtao Đawit wei lê̆ Mêphibôset, kon drŏ-nglo Jônathan, sâu tơm pơtao Sôl, yua kơ đei nơ̆r pơkă hăm Kră Yang gah bre pơtao Đawit hăm Jônathan, kon drŏ-nglo pơtao Sôl."
"So the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite","Mă-lei Đawit rôp jao Armôni păng Mephibôset, 'bar 'nu kon drŏ-nglo mă yă Rispa, kon drŏ-kăn Aiyah, tơpŭ ăn kơ pơtao Sôl; pơtao kư̆m rôp pơđăm 'nu kon drŏ-nglo yă Mêrap kon drŏ-kăn Sôl, 'bă lu sư noh Adriel, kon Barsilai, bơngai Mêhôlat."
"and he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them on the hill before the LORD. So they fell, all seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley harvest.","Pơtao pơjao lu sư kơ bơngai Gibeôn.

"Now Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it for herself on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until the late rains poured on them from heaven. And she did not allow the birds of the air to rest on them by day nor the beasts of the field by night.","Yă Rispa kon drŏ-kăn Aiya, iŏk minh blah 'bi lơ̆k kơpal tơmo, păng yă ei oei tơ noh đơ̆ng bơyan yuă blŭng truh tơ đei 'mi đơ̆ng kơpal plĕnh jruh tơ kơpal akâu lu bơngai lôch.

"And David was told what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.","Đei bơngai tơbăt ăn kơ pơtao Đawit dôm tơdrong yă Rispa, kon drŏ-kăn Aiya, akăn kơnhŏng pơtao Sôl, đei pơm."
"Then David went and took the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathan his son, from the men of Jabesh Gilead who had stolen them from the street of Beth Shan, where the Philistines had hung them up, after the Philistines had struck down Saul in Gilboa.","Pơtao Đawit năm tơ'bơ̆p lu bơngai pơgơ̆r lăm pơlei Jabes tơ Gileat wă apinh iŏk kơting pơtao Sôl păng kơting Jônathan kon drŏ-nglo pơtao.

"So he brought up the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from there; and they gathered the bones of those who had been hanged.","Pơtao chĕp ba kơting pơtao Sôl păng kơting Jônathan kon pơtao, đơ̆ng Jabes, đơ̆ng noh wơh lu bơngai năm iŏk kơting lu bơngai mă đe hrek hơtol noh."
"They buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the tomb of Kish his father. So they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God heeded the prayer for the land.","Chĕp ba 'bŭ hơdai hăm kơting pơtao Sôl păng Jônathan kon pơtao, tơ Sêla lăm teh đak Bênjamin lăm bơsat Kis 'bă pơtao Sôl.

"When the Philistines were at war again with Israel, David and his servants with him went down and fought against the Philistines; and David grew faint.","Bơngai Philistin đei tơblah hăm kon pơlei Isơrael dơ̆ng.

"Then Ishbi-Benob, who was one of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose bronze spear was three hundred shekels, who was bearing a new sword, thought he could kill David.","Isbi Benop minh 'nu bơngai Philistin gah adrĕch adrung bơngai Rapha tih kơjung đei tơju pơm păng kong trăp pêng kĭ minh puăt, păng kiĕo đao 'nao tơ kơiĕng, wă pơlôch pơtao Đawit."
"But Abishai the son of Zeruiah came to his aid, and struck the Philistine and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, “You shall go out no more with us to battle, lest you quench the lamp of Israel.”","Mă-lei Abisai, kon yă Sêruia năm dŏng pơtao, blah bơngai Philistin 'noh păng pơlôch lê̆ lu sư.

"Now it happened afterward that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob. Then Sibbechai the Hushathite killed Saph, who was one of the sons of the giant.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ noh, tơdrong tơblah truh dơ̆ng hăm bơngai Philistin tơ pơlei Gop, kơplah noh Sibêkai, bơngai Husa, pơlôch Sap bơngai tih kơjung gah adrĕch adrung bơngai Rapha."
"Again there was war at Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaare-Oregim the Bethlehemite killed the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.","Tơblah minh 'măng nai dơ̆ng hăm bơngai Philistin kư̆m tơ pơlei Gop, Êlhanan kon drŏ-nglo Jaar Ôregim bơngai Betlehem, pơlôch Gôliat, bơngai pơlei Gat; đei tơju gơ̆r tih thoi 'long không đe tanh brai."
"Yet again there was war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number; and he also was born to the giant.","Tơdrong tơblah đei truh dơ̆ng tơ pơlei Gat, tơ noh đei minh 'nu bơngai tih kơjung, jơ̆ng ti sư tă kơ đei tơdrâu tŏ hơnglâu ngăl, đĭ-đăng sư đei 'bar-jĭt puăn tŏ hơnglâu; bơngai 'nâu kư̆m adrĕch adrung bơngai Rapha."
"So when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, David’s brother, killed him.","Bơngai 'nâu pơma hơno hăm kon pơlei Isơrael; mă-lei Jônathan, kon drŏ-nglo Simêi 'nhŏng pơtao Đawit pơlôch sư."
"These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.","Puăn 'nu mă roi tơ kơpal âu, tă kơ gah adrĕch adrung bơngai Rapha, pơlei Gat. Lu sư tă kơ lôch kơ ti pơtao Đawit păng khŭl linh sư."
"Then David spoke to the LORD the words of this song, on the day when the LORD had delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul.","Pơtao Đawit pơyơ̆r kơ Kră Yang lu nơ̆r hơri 'nâu, đơ̆ng rŏng kơ Kră Yang dŏng pơklaih sư đơ̆ng ti bơngai ayăt păng đơ̆ng ti pơtao Sôl."

"These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb-Basshebeth the Tachmonite, chief among the captains.

"Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab and against the captains of the army. Therefore Joab and the captains of the army went out from the presence of the king to count the people of Israel.","Lei ră nơ̆r pơtao pơkă, ưh kơ đei tơplih, na Jôap păng lu yŏng linh, khŏm athei năm jô̆ kơ̆l kon bơngai jơ̆p kơ teh đak Isơrael."
"And they crossed over the Jordan and camped in Aroer, on the right side of the town which is in the midst of the ravine of Gad, and toward Jazer.","Lu sư năm tŏk hlôi kơ đak Krong Jôrđăn păng pơtơm jô̆ bơngai iŏk đơ̆ng pơlei Arôe, păng minh pôm pơlei oei lăm thŭng, na tŏk tơ tơring Gat truh tơ pơlei Jaser."
"Then they came to Gilead and to the land of Tahtim Hodshi; they came to Dan Jaan and around to Sidon","Lu sư truh tơ tơring Gileat, năm rok tơpăt hlôi kơ teh đak bơngai Tahtim, truh tơ pơlei Hôsi pơlei Đan Jaan đơ̆ng noh dăr brŏk tơ pơlei Siđôn."
"and they came to the stronghold of Tyre and to all the cities of the Hivites and the Canaanites. Then they went out to South Judah as far as Beersheba.","Lu sư năm truh tơ pơlei Tirơ, minh pôm pơlei tih kơjăp, păng năm jơ̆p kơ pơlei bơngai Hêwit păng bơngai Kanaan. Tuch-luch, lu sư năm truh tơ pơlei Bêrsêba gah tơring teh glă gah gơal lăm dêh Juđa."
"So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.","Lu sư brŏk truh tơ pơlei Jêrusalem đơ̆ng rŏng kơ năm jơ̆p teh đak hiong tơsĭn khei 'bar-jĭt năr."
"Then Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to the king. And there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword, and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.","Jôap tơbăt ăn kơ pơtao tơdrong jô̆ kơ̆l bơngai Isơrael đei tơhngam-hrĕng rơbâu 'nu bơngai linh tơblah gơh hơgei chĕp đao, păng lăm Juđa đei pơđăm-hrĕng rơbâu 'nu."
"And David’s heart condemned him after he had numbered the people. So David said to the LORD, “I have sinned greatly in what I have done; but now, I pray, O LORD, take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have done very foolishly.”","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ jô̆ kơ̆l kon bơngai đang boih, pơtao Đawit jơhngơ̆m sư ưh kơ hiôk păng khan kơ Kră Yang: “Kơkuh kơ Ih Kră Yang, inh đei pơm boih minh tơdrong kơtul bơlŭk păng yoch trăp. Dang ei inh apinh Kră Yang mơnat ăn kơ inh đĭch đam Ih.”"
"Now when David arose in the morning, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying","Pơgê năr đơ̆ng rŏng adrol kơ pơtao Đawit hơđơ̆r, Kră Yang khan kơ Gat bơngai khan lê̆ adrol, sư bơ̆jang lăm hnam pơtao Đawit"
"“Go and tell David, ‘Thus says the LORD: “I offer you three things; choose one of them for yourself, that I may do it to you.” ’ ”","“Ih athei năm khan kơ Đawit: ‘Kră Yang khan thoi âu: Inh đei pêng tơdrong wă hơmet ih. Inh ăn kơ ih rơih iŏk minh lăm pêng tơdrong noh, Inh gô kiơ̆ kơ noh na hơmet ih.’ ”"
"So Gad came to David and told him; and he said to him, “Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land? Or shall you flee three months before your enemies, while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days’ plague in your land? Now consider and see what answer I should take back to Him who sent me.”","Gat bơngai khan lê̆ adrol năm roi ăn kơ pơtao Đawit. Bơngai khan lê̆ adrol apinh pơtao: “Pơtao rơih iŏk tơdrong ayơ: Tơpơh sơnăm pơngot rơwĕt jơ̆p-jang kơ lăm teh đak pơtao, dah pêng khei pơtao athei kơdâu ôn lăm kơplah ayăt oei druh pơtao, dah pêng năr đei tơdrong jĭ hơbuh tơ jơ̆p-jang teh đak? Dang ei apinh ih athei tơchĕng lăng mă hơlen, wă kơ inh gơh roi ăn kơ Kră Yang Tơ'ngla wơh inh noh thoi yơ.”"
"And David said to Gad, “I am in great distress. Please let us fall into the hand of the LORD, for His mercies are great; but do not let me fall into the hand of man.”","Pơtao Đawit khan kơ Gat bơngai khan lê̆ adrol: “Inh hơwơ̆l hơwang dêh, inh anat kơ wă rơih.

"So the LORD sent a plague upon Israel from the morning till the appointed time. From Dan to Beersheba seventy thousand men of the people died.","Na Kră Yang ăn tơdrong jĭ hơbuh jur tơ kon pơlei Isơrael đơ̆ng pơgê năr noh truh tơ tôch jơ Sư pơkă. Đơ̆ng Đan truh tơ Bêrsêba, đei tơpơh-jĭt rơbâu 'nu bơngai lôch."
"And when the angel stretched out His hand over Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD relented from the destruction, and said to the angel who was destroying the people, “It is enough; now restrain your hand.” And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.","Linh jang 'lơ̆ng chro ti sư tơ gah pơlei Jêrusalem wă pơrăm lê̆ pơlei, mă-lei Kră Yang ưh pă wă pơmat lu sư dơ̆ng, na Sư khan kơ linh jang 'lơ̆ng mă oei pơrăm kon pơlei pơla: “Tôm boih!

"Then David spoke to the LORD when he saw the angel who was striking the people, and said, “Surely I have sinned, and I have done wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Let Your hand, I pray, be against me and against my father’s house.”","Lăp pơtao Đawit 'bôh linh jang 'lơ̆ng pơlôch pơrăm kon pơlei pơla, na pơtao apinh Kră Yang khan: “Inh boih mă bơngai yoch, inh boih mă bơngai glăi dêh! Na mă lu kon triu 'nâu lu sư ưh kơ đei pơm tơdrong kiơ ôh? Apinh ti Kră Yang pơrăm inh hăm 'nhŏng oh hnam 'bă inh đĕch.”"
"And Gad came that day to David and said to him, “Go up, erect an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.”","Lăm năr noh, Gat bơngai khan lê̆ adrol năm khan kơ pơtao Đawit: “Apinh pơtao năm truh tơ dơnih pơjuă 'ba Arauna bơngai Jêbus păng tơiung pơdơ̆ng 'bơ̆t doh minh pôm chơnang soi kơkuh kơ Kră Yang.”"
"So David, according to the word of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded.","Pơtao Đawit năm hloi kiơ̆ kơ nơ̆r Gat bơngai khan lê̆ adrol tơ'bôh thoi Kră Yang đei bơtho pơkă ăn kơ sư."
"Now Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming toward him. So Araunah went out and bowed before the king with his face to the ground.","Arauna ngơk lăng 'bôh pơtao păng đĭch đam sư năm adrol kơ sư, na sư năm lĕch tơkan kŭp kơ̆l drap muh măt tơ teh, kơkuh kơ pơtao."
"Then Araunah said, “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?” And David said, “To buy the threshing floor from you, to build an altar to the LORD, that the plague may be withdrawn from the people.”","Arauna khan: “Ơ pơtao yŏng tơ'ngla inh, năm tơ'bơ̆p đĭch đam hăm đei tơdrong kiơ wă bơtho tơ'bôh ưh?” Pơtao Đawit tơl khan: “Inh năm răt dơnih pơjuă 'ba ih.

"Now Araunah said to David, “Let my lord the king take and offer up whatever seems good to him. Look, here are oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing implements and the yokes of the oxen for wood.","Arauna tơl pơtao Đawit: “Apinh pơtao yŏng tơ'ngla inh mơ̆ng kơ ih wă yua dơnih pơjuă 'ba 'nâu păng pơyơ̆r tơmam soi kiơ̆ kơ pơtao tơchĕng 'nâu đei boih rơmo wă pơyơ̆r pơm tơmam soi 'buh, kư̆m đei gơ'bang pơjuă 'ba păng 'long ăt rơmo wă pơm 'long ŭnh."
"All these, O king, Araunah has given to the king.” And Araunah said to the king, “May the LORD your God accept you.”","Ơ pơtao! Arauna apinh pơyơ̆r ăn kơ pơtao đĭ-đăng tơmam noh.” Arauna tơl dơ̆ng: “Apinh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei pơtao tơl tơwih nơ̆r pơtao.”"
"Then the king said to Araunah, “No, but I will surely buy it from you for a price; nor will I offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God with that which costs me nothing.” So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.","Mă-lei pơtao tơl khan: “Ưh kơ gơh.

"And David built there an altar to the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD heeded the prayers for the land, and the plague was withdrawn from Israel.","Đawit pơm minh pôm chơnang soi kơkuh, wă kơkuh kơ Kră Yang, pơtao pơyơ̆r kơ Kră Yang tơmam soi 'buh.
