"After the death of Moses the servant of the LORD, it came to pass that the LORD spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ assistant, saying","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ Môis đĭch đam Kră Yang lôch boih, Kră Yang bơtho khan kơ Jôsuê đam kơiĕng Môis, kon drŏ-nglo Nun."
"“Moses My servant is dead. Now therefore, arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them—the children of Israel.","Môis đĭch đam Inh hlôi lôch, dang ei kon pơlei pơla ih iung bĕ, năm tŏk găn kơ đak Krong Jôrđăn, truh tơ teh đak mă Inh gô ăn kơ lu adrĕch adrung Isơrael."
"Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given you, as I said to Moses.","Anih ayơ tơpang jơ̆ng lu iĕm juă, Inh gô ăn kơ lu iĕm, thoi Inh đei pơkă bơih hăm Môis."
"From the wilderness and this Lebanon as far as the great river, the River Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the Great Sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your territory.","Teh lu iĕm să iŏk đơ̆ng tơmăn glă păng kông Liban âu truh tơ đak Krong Tih, noh krong Ơphrat păng đĭ kơ dêh char kon pơlei Hêtit, truh tơ đak Dơsĭ Tih tơ gah 'năr mơ̆t."
"No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life; as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not leave you nor forsake you.","Đĭ lăm chăl arih ih, ưh kơ đei bu kĕ blah ih, Inh gô oei hơdai hăm ih thoi Inh oei hơdai hăm Môis, Inh ưh kơ achăng ih păng ưh kơ lê̆ ih ôh."
"Be strong and of good courage, for to this people you shall divide as an inheritance the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.","Ih Athei chơ̆n jơhngơ̆m nuih pran yua kơ ih gô chông ba lu kon pơlei pơla năm iŏk dêh char mă Inh đei pơkă boih wă ăn kơ lu 'bok iĕm."
"Only be strong and very courageous, that you may observe to do according to all the law which Moses My servant commanded you; do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may prosper wherever you go.","Ih athei chơ̆n jơhngơ̆m nuih pran păng pơm kiơ̆ kơ khôi juăt Môis đĭch đam Inh, mă tơbăt kơ ih, 'nĕ kơ weh gah 'ma gah 'ngiĕo, lei na mă năm tơ yơ gô đei tơdrong kĕ jei ih."
"This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate in it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.","Sơ̆p hla bơar khôi juăt âu 'nĕ kơ ataih đơ̆ng 'bơ̆r ih, athei tơchĕng măng năr, lei athei pơ'lơ̆ng pơm kiơ̆ kơ nơ̆r đei chih lăm noh, thoi noh na lăm trong ih năm gô đei tơdrong pŭn hiôk."
"Have I not commanded you? Be strong and of good courage; do not be afraid, nor be dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go.”","Hăm trŏ kơ Inh đei khan bơih kơ ih? Athei ih nuih kơtang păng chơ̆n jơhngơ̆m, nuih pran, 'nĕ kơ rơdu, yua kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ih oei hơdai hăm ih lăm rim trong ih năm."
"Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying","Thoi noh Jôsuê athei lu bơngai mă wei-lăng lu kon pơlei pơla"
"“Pass through the camp and command the people, saying, ‘Prepare provisions for yourselves, for within three days you will cross over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God is giving you to possess.’ ”","“Lu iĕm athei năm jơ̆p tơ rim anih tơbăt ăn kơ kon pơlei: Hơmet bĕ tơmam sa lu iĕm, yua kơ pă pêng năr boih lu iĕm gô yak tŏk găn kơ đak Krong Jôrđăn, wă năm blah iŏk teh đak mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei gô ăn kơ lu iĕm.”"
"And to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh Joshua spoke, saying","Jôsuê khan kơ adrĕch Rubên adrĕch Gat păng minh puăt adrĕch Manase."
"“Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, ‘The LORD your God is giving you rest and is giving you this land.’","'Blŏk bĕ kơ nơ̆r Môis, đĭch đam Kră Yang đei pơkă kơ lu iĕm, sư khan: Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei gô ăn kơ lu iĕm hiôk-hian păng đei pơkă ăn boih kơ lu iĕm teh đak âu."
"Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan. But you shall pass before your brethren armed, all your mighty men of valor, and help them","Lu akăn iĕm, kon hơ'lơ̆p iĕm păng sem dơrong lu iĕm gô oei lăm teh mă Môis đei ăn boih kơ lu iĕm, tơ gah hơlĕch kơ đak Krong Jôrđăn, mă-lei đĭ-đăng lu drŏ-nglo nuih kơtang, chĕp tơmam tơblah, đao kơtuang hơlă, tŏk năm adrol kơ lu 'nhŏng oh lu iĕm păng tơgŭm lu sư"
"until the LORD has given your brethren rest, as He gave you, and they also have taken possession of the land which the LORD your God is giving them. Then you shall return to the land of your possession and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD’s servant gave you on this side of the Jordan toward the sunrise.”","dĭng dang yơ mă Kră Yang ăn tơdrong hiôk-hian kơ lu 'nhŏng oh iĕm thoi đei ăn boih kơ lu iĕm păng dĭng lu sư đei iŏk asong băl dêh char mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei đei ăn kơ lu sư.

"So they answered Joshua, saying, “All that you command us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.","Lu bơngai noh đei tơl Jôsuê: “Lu nhôn gô pơm kiơ̆ kơ ih pơkă athei păng năm jơ̆p-jang anih ayơ mă ih đei wơh."
"Just as we heeded Moses in all things, so we will heed you. Only the LORD your God be with you, as He was with Moses.","Lu nhôn chu kiơ̆ ih lăm tôm tơdrong jang, thoi chu kiơ̆ Môis, apinh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei oei hơdai ih, thoi Kră Yang oei hơdai Môis."
"Whoever rebels against your command and does not heed your words, in all that you command him, shall be put to death. Only be strong and of good courage.”","Bơngai bu ưh kơ chu pơm kiơ̆ nơ̆r ih bơtho pơkă păng dôm tơdrong jang kiơ ih athei, lu bơngai noh gô pơlôch sư, ih athei chơ̆n jơhngơ̆m nuih pran.”"
"Now Joshua the son of Nun sent out two men from Acacia Grove to spy secretly, saying, “Go, view the land, especially Jericho.” So they went, and came to the house of a harlot named Rahab, and lodged there.","Jôsuê kon drŏ-nglo Nun, đơ̆ng Sitim, wơh 'bar 'nu bơngai năm chop lăng char, sư khan: “Năm chop lăng char, mă loi pơlei Jêrikô, thoi noh 'bar 'nu bơngai noh năm truh tơ hnam minh 'nu bơngai drŏ-kăn pơm đi anăn sư Rahap, 'bĭch hloi tơ noh."
"And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, “Behold, men have come here tonight from the children of Israel to search out the country.”","Lu đe roi ăn kơ pơtao Jêrikô: Măng âu đei 'bar 'nu bơngai drŏ-nglo Isơrael năm chop lăng char bơ̆n.”"
"So the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, “Bring out the men who have come to you, who have entered your house, for they have come to search out all the country.”","Pơtao pơlei Jêrikô wơh đe năm khan kơ Rahap: Tơlĕch bĕ bre 'bar 'nu bơngai drŏ-nglo mơ̆t lăm hnam ih, yua kơ 'bar 'nu bre noh năm tơ âu wă chop lăng teh đak bơ̆n."
"Then the woman took the two men and hid them. So she said, “Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they were from.","Mă-lei Rahap năm chông ôn lê̆ bre 'bar 'nu bơngai drŏ-nglo noh păng khan: Tơpă đei bre sư truh tơ hnam inh, mă-lei inh ưh kơ băt ôh bre sư đơ̆ng yơ."
"And it happened as the gate was being shut, when it was dark, that the men went out. Where the men went I do not know; pursue them quickly, for you may overtake them.”","Hiưp kơ măng, 'măng dur wă tang, 'bar 'nu bơngai noh lĕch, inh kư̆m ưh kơ băt trong ayơ, jah druh 'moi bre sư, druh 'moi bĕ băt kư̆m tam mơ̆n."
"(But she had brought them up to the roof and hidden them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order on the roof.)","Mă-lei Rahap athei bre sư tŏk hao kơpal bơbŭng hnam, ôn lê̆ bre sư lăm bơmreh brang mă sư đei sơ̆k dan lê̆ kơpal bơbŭng"
"Then the men pursued them by the road to the Jordan, to the fords. And as soon as those who pursued them had gone out, they shut the gate.","lu bơngai druh 'moi rok trong truh tơ đak Krong Jôrđăn anih đơng 'biơ̆. Lăp lu sư năm 'nao hlôi kơ pơlei, 'măng dur đe tang hloi."
"Now before they lay down, she came up to them on the roof","Adrol kơ 'bar 'nu chop lăng tam mă tep, Rahap tŏk tơ kơpal bơbŭng hnam"
"and said to the men: “I know that the LORD has given you the land, that the terror of you has fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land are fainthearted because of you.","pơma khan: Inh băt Kră Yang ăn boih kơ lu iĕm dêh char âu, lu nhôn hli krưp dêh păng đĭ-đăng kon pơlei pơla lăm char âu jơhngơ̆m lu sư hli tơrơ dêh kơ lu iĕm tơpă."
"For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who were on the other side of the Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed.","Lu nhôn kư̆m băt hơdah, lu iĕm lĕch đơ̆ng char Êyiptơ, Kră Yang pơm ăn kơ đak Dơsĭ 'Brê hrơ̆, tơ'bôh hơdah 'bơ̆t anăp lu iĕm păng lu iĕm đei pơm boih kơ Sihôn păng Ôk, 'bar 'nu pơtao Amôrit, gah to đak Krong Jôrđăn, mă lu iĕm đei pơlôch pơrăm đĭ boih."
"And as soon as we heard these things, our hearts melted; neither did there remain any more courage in anyone because of you, for the LORD your God, He is God in heaven above and on earth beneath.","Lu nhôn kư̆m hlôi băt tơdrong noh, jơhngơ̆m hli mah hach hiong thoi đak ro, ưh kơ đei bu lăm lu nhôn wă nuih blah lu iĕm dơ̆ng, yua kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu iĕm boih Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei tih hloh, mă oei tơ kơpal plĕnh ti păng ala teh âu."
"Now therefore, I beg you, swear to me by the LORD, since I have shown you kindness, that you also will show kindness to my father’s house, and give me a true token","Dang ei inh bơngai pơm 'lơ̆ng bơih hăm măr iĕm, apinh măr iĕm kư̆m athei pơm 'lơ̆ng kơ hnam dơnŏ 'bă inh, yua anăn Kră Yang pơkă pơkăm bĕ hăm inh păng đei tơdra pơsĭt kơjăp."
"and spare my father, my mother, my brothers, my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.”","Thoi noh lu iĕm gô lê̆ mĕ 'bă, 'nhŏng oh, mai oh đĭ-đăng kon mon lu sư oei arih, pơklaih lu sư đơ̆ng tơdrong lôch."
"So the men answered her, “Our lives for yours, if none of you tell this business of ours. And it shall be, when the LORD has given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you.”","Bre noh tơl: Yua kơ ih ăn kơ nhi oei arih, nhi kư̆m gô ăn kơ ih oei arih mơ̆n, tơdah ih ưh kơ roi kơ đe tơdrong jang lu nhôn âu, lei lu nhôn gô pơm 'lơ̆ng kơ ih păng gô pơm trŏ thoi nhôn pơkă, kơplah năr mă Kră Yang ăn dêh char âu kơ nhôn."
"Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was on the city wall; she dwelt on the wall.","Thoi noh Rahap iŏk minh dăng tơlei giĕn tơjur bre 'bar 'nu âu trong 'măng-'mŏk yua kơ hnam sư oei noh pơm lăm dur."
"And she said to them, “Get to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you. Hide there three days, until the pursuers have returned. Afterward you may go your way.”","Rahap khan: Năm tŏk tơ kông bĕ, kơnh hli kơ lu bơngai druh 'moi tam măr iĕm, măr iĕm athei ôn tơ noh pêng năr, truh tơ lu bơngai druh măr iĕm wih brŏk, đơ̆ng rŏng noh măr iĕm yak."
"So the men said to her: “We will be blameless of this oath of yours which you have made us swear","Na 'bar 'nu bơngai noh đei pơma hăm Rahap: “Âu nhi pơma pơkăm pơkă hăm ih, mă ih athei nhi pơkă"
"unless, when we come into the land, you bind this line of scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and unless you bring your father, your mother, your brothers, and all your father’s household to your own home.","Layơ lu nhôn mơ̆t tơ âu, ih athei chô̆ brai thêt 'bơ̆t 'măng-'mŏk mă ih đei tơjur nhi, na ih athei krao akŭm, đĭ-đăng mĕ 'bă 'nhŏng oh păng kon mon lăm hnam ih"
"So it shall be that whoever goes outside the doors of your house into the street, his blood shall be on his own head, and we will be guiltless. And whoever is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head if a hand is laid on him.","tơdah đei bơngai bu lĕch tơ 'nguaih đơ̆ng 'măng hnam ih, na pham lu sư gô tuh kơpal kơ̆l lu sư kơdih, lei lu nhôn ưh kơ đei yoch ôh, mă-lei tơdah bơngai bu mă pơlôch bơngai oei lăm hnam ih, pham sư gô tuh tơ kơpal kơ̆l lu nhôn."
"And if you tell this business of ours, then we will be free from your oath which you made us swear.”","Ih roi tơdrong nhi pơm lei nhi ưh pă yoch hăm nơ̆r nhi pơkăm hăm ih boih mă ih wă kơ nhi pơkă noh."
"Then she said, “According to your words, so be it.” And she sent them away, and they departed. And she bound the scarlet cord in the window.","Rahap tơl: Trŏ boih kư̆ kiơ̆ thoi măr iĕm pơma.” Na Rahap ăn kơ bre 'bar 'nu noh năm, bre sư yak hloi. Rahap chô̆ tơlei brai thêt 'bơ̆t 'măng-'mŏk sư."
"They departed and went to the mountain, and stayed there three days until the pursuers returned. The pursuers sought them all along the way, but did not find them.","Bre noh tŏk tơ kông, oei tơ noh pêng năr, dĭng truh tơ lu bơngai druh weh brŏk, lu bơngai druh chă jơ̆p-jang ưh kơ tơ'bơ̆p"
"So the two men returned, descended from the mountain, and crossed over; and they came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all that had befallen them.","Bre bơngai chop lăng noh jur đơ̆ng kông wih brŏk, bre sư yak hlôi kơ đak Krong Jôrđăn, truh tơ anih Jôsuê, kon drŏ-nglo Nun, sư roi tôm tơdrong đei truh."
"And they said to Joshua, “Truly the LORD has delivered all the land into our hands, for indeed all the inhabitants of the country are fainthearted because of us.”","Bre sư roi ăn kơ Jôsuê: “Tơpă boih, Kră Yang jao ăn pơlei noh lăm ti lu bơ̆n, đĭ-đăng kon pơlei lăm tơring noh hli tơrơ dêh kơ lu bơ̆n.”"
"Then Joshua rose early in the morning; and they set out from Acacia Grove and came to the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they crossed over.","'Brưch pơgê oei hrôih, Jôsuê drôih chông ba kon pơlei Isơrael, đơ̆ng Sitim, lu sư năm truh tơ jih đak Krong Jôrđăn, 'bĭch gô tơ noh adrol kơ tŏk găn đak Krong."
"So it was, after three days, that the officers went through the camp","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ lăm pêng năr, lu bơngai wei-lăng năm jơ̆p kơ rim anih."
"and they commanded the people, saying, “When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests, the Levites, bearing it, then you shall set out from your place and go after it.","Pơkă kơ kon pơlei: Tơdah lu iĕm 'bôh lu 'bok soi, adrĕch Lêwi tung Hom tơdrong pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu iĕm, iĕm athei iung weh đơ̆ng anih iĕm oei kiơ̆ đơ̆ng rŏng."
"Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure. Do not come near it, that you may know the way by which you must go, for you have not passed this way before.”","Mă-lei yak ataih băl sơlam lu iĕm hăm Hom tơdrong pơgơ̆p Kră Yang noh dang 'bar-rơbâu hơgăt; 'nĕ kơ yak jê̆, wă kơ lu iĕm băt kơ trong yak; yua kơ lu iĕm ưh tam lah yak trong noh."
"And Joshua said to the people, “Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow the LORD will do wonders among you.”","Jôsuê kư̆m khan kơ kon pơlei: Lu iĕm athei wei akâu mă 'lơ̆ng rơgoh yua kơ dơning Kră Yang gô pơm tơdrong hlĭch chrơp, tŏk-bŏk lu iĕm"
"Then Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, “Take up the ark of the covenant and cross over before the people.” So they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people.","Jôsuê khan lu 'bok soi: Lu iĕm athei tung Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang năm adrol kơ lu kon pơlei. Lei na lu 'bok soi tung hom tơdrong pơgơ̆p Kră Yang yak adrol kơ kon pơlei."
"And the LORD said to Joshua, “This day I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.","Kră Yang khan kơ Jôsuê: Dang ei Inh gô pôk pơyom ih 'bơ̆t anăp lu bơngai Isơrael, wă kơ lu sư băt Inh Kră Yang oei hơdai ih, thoi Inh đei oei hơdai hăm Môis sơ̆."
"You shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, saying, ‘When you have come to the edge of the water of the Jordan, you shall stand in the Jordan.’ ”","Ih athei khan kơ lu 'bok soi tung Hom Pơgơ̆p: Lăp lu iĕm truh 'bơ̆t jih đak Krong Jôrđăn lu iĕm jur dơ̆ng tŏk-bŏk đak krong."
"So Joshua said to the children of Israel, “Come here, and hear the words of the LORD your God.”","Na Jôsuê khan kơ lu kon pơlei Isơrael. “Năm mă jê̆ tơ âu, wă mơ̆ng nơ̆r Kră Yang lu iĕm."
"And Joshua said, “By this you shall know that the living God is among you, and that He will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Hivites and the Perizzites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Jebusites","Jôsuê khan dơ̆ng: Yua kơ đơ̆ng tơdrong âu, na lu iĕm gô băt Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei arih ling-lang Sư oei hơdai hăm lu iĕm păng Sư gô puh tơweh lê̆ lu bơngai Kanaan, bơngai Hêtit, bơngai Hêwit, bơngai Phêrisit, bơngai Girgasit, bơngai Amôrit păng bơngai Jêbus."
"Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is crossing over before you into the Jordan.","To Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang kơ đĭ-đăng kon bơngai lăm kơpal teh gô năm adrol kơ lu iĕm jur lăm đak Krong Jôrđăn."
"Now therefore, take for yourselves twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man from every tribe.","Thoi noh, rơih iŏk bĕ đơ̆ng lăm mơjĭt-'bar adrĕch bơngai Isơrael, rim adrĕch iŏk minh 'nu."
"And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, that the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off, the waters that come down from upstream, and they shall stand as a heap.”","Păng mưh lu 'bok soi tung Hom tơdrong pơgơ̆p Kră Yang, Sư Kră Yang pơgơ̆r plĕnh teh, lăp lu sư 'nao jur tong jơ̆ng tơ lăm đak Krong Jôrđăn, đak kơtĕch tơklah păng akŭm jing minh 'bôt.”"
"So it was, when the people set out from their camp to cross over the Jordan, with the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people","Lăp kon pơlei yuih bơsŭn lu sư wă yak tŏk găn đak Krong Jôrđăn, lu 'bok soi tung Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang năm adrol kơ kon pơlei."
"and as those who bore the ark came to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests who bore the ark dipped in the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its banks during the whole time of harvest)","Kơplah ei trŏ bơyan kĕch 'ba, đak Krong Jôrđăn tih tŏk 'bĕnh lah lai bơnơ̆.

"that the waters which came down from upstream stood still, and rose in a heap very far away at Adam, the city that is beside Zaretan. So the waters that went down into the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, failed, and were cut off; and the people crossed over opposite Jericho.","Na đak đơ̆ng tu khơ̆t kơtĕch hloi, đak pơpôi minh 'bôt 'bĕnh tŏk truh tơ pơlei Ađam, pơlei noh jê̆ pơlei Sarêthan; na bơbah đak ro truh tơ đak dơsĭ Araba, ‘wă khan Dơsĭ 'Boh,’ hrơ̆ hrĕng, na lu kon pơlei jur yak tŏk rok tơklă pơlei Jêrikô"
"Then the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan; and all Israel crossed over on dry ground, until all the people had crossed completely over the Jordan.","lu 'bok soi tung Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang lu sư đơ̆ng kơjăp 'bơ̆t trong teh hrĕng lăm đak Krong Jôrđăn, kơplah lu kon pơlei Isơrael kư̆m yak năm rok teh hrĕng, gô dĭng truh đĭ kon pơlei yak hlôi boih kơ đak Krong Jôrđăn."
"And it came to pass, when all the people had completely crossed over the Jordan, that the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying","Kơplah đĭ-đăng kon pơlei tŏk hlôi kơ đak Krong Jôrđăn boih, Kră Yang khan kơ Jôsuê"
"“Take for yourselves twelve men from the people, one man from every tribe","Rơih iŏk bĕ mơjĭt-'bar 'nu đơ̆ng lăm kon pơlei, rim adrĕch minh 'nu."
"and command them, saying, ‘Take for yourselves twelve stones from here, out of the midst of the Jordan, from the place where the priests’ feet stood firm.

"Then Joshua called the twelve men whom he had appointed from the children of Israel, one man from every tribe","Thoi noh Jôsuê krao mơjĭt-'bar 'nu, mă sư đei rơih, lăm kon pơlei Isơrael, rim adrĕch minh 'nu."
"and Joshua said to them: “Cross over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of the Jordan, and each one of you take up a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel","Na pơkă khan: Năm bĕ adrol kơ Hom Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu iĕm tŏk-bŏk đak Krong Jôrđăn, na rim 'nu, kiơ̆ kơ adrĕch Isơrael, athei iŏk tôi ba minh pôm tơmo kơpal hơngiĕng."
"that this may be a sign among you when your children ask in time to come, saying, ‘What do these stones mean to you?’","Tơdrong noh wă pơm tơdra tŏk-bŏk lu iĕm. Ning-mônh, tơdah lu kon sâu iĕm đei jet: Lu tơmo âu wă khan kiơ?"
"Then you shall answer them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it crossed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. And these stones shall be for a memorial to the children of Israel forever.”","Lei lu iĕm tơl: Noh wă khan đak Krong Jôrđăn tơklah kơplah Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang năm rok đak krong, na đak krong khơ̆t kơtĕch tŏk-bŏk, tơmo âu wă pơm kơ kon pơlei Isơrael 'blŏk hơdơ̆r ling-lang."
"And the children of Israel did so, just as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones from the midst of the Jordan, as the LORD had spoken to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over with them to the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.","Thoi noh na kon pơlei Isơrael pơm kiơ̆ thoi Jôsuê pơkă, dônh iŏk mơjĭt-'bar tŏ tơmo, tŏk-bŏk đak Krong Jôrđăn, kiơ̆ kơ adrĕch Isơrael, chĕp ba tơmo noh dan tơ anih ayơ mă lu sư wă pơdơh tep kơmăng; kiơ̆ thoi Kră Yang đei pơkă kơ Jôsuê."

"So the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan until everything was finished that the LORD had commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua; and the people hurried and crossed over.","Lu 'bok soi tung Hom Pơgơ̆p dơ̆ng tŏk-bŏk đak Krong Jôrđăn dĭng truh keh tôm tơdrong mă Kră Yang đei athei Jôsuê khan ăn kơ kon pơlei, kiơ̆ thoi Môis đei pơkă kơ Jôsuê, kon pơlei yak hăt hot hlôi kơ đak krong."
"Then it came to pass, when all the people had completely crossed over, that the ark of the LORD and the priests crossed over in the presence of the people.","Lăp đĭ-đăng kon pơlei tŏk hlôi kơ đak krong boih, na Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang păng lu 'bok soi, kư̆m năm yak tŏk rok 'bơ̆t anăp kon pơlei."
"And the men of Reuben, the men of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh crossed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses had spoken to them.","Kon sâu Rubên, kon sâu Gat păng minh puăt kon sâu Manase chĕp khêl đao yak adrol kơ kon pơlei Isơrael trŏ thoi Môis đei khan tơbăt kơ lu sư"
"About forty thousand prepared for war crossed over before the LORD for battle, to the plains of Jericho.","Đei dang puăn-jĭt rơbâu 'nu bơngai hơmet năm tơblah, dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang truh tơ anih glă Jêrikô, wă blah lu bơngai ayăt."
"On that day the LORD exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they had feared Moses, all the days of his life.","Năr noh Kră Yang ăn kơ Jôsuê jing đe pơyom 'bơ̆t anăp đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael păng đe hli yom đĭ chăl sư oei arih, thoi đe chu yom kơ Môis mơ̆n."
"Then the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying","Kơplah noh Kră Yang khan dơ̆ng kơ Jôsuê"
"“Command the priests who bear the ark of the Testimony to come up from the Jordan.”","Khan bĕ kơ lu 'bok soi, tung Hom tŏk đơ̆ng đak Krong Jôrđăn."
"Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, “Come up from the Jordan.”","Thoi noh Jôsuê khan kơ lu 'bok soi: Tŏk bĕ đơ̆ng lăm Krong Jôrđăn."
"And it came to pass, when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD had come from the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests’ feet touched the dry land, that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and overflowed all its banks as before.","Lu 'bok soi tung Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang tŏk hlôi kơ đak krong jơ̆ng lu sư hiŏng 'nao wă juă tơ kông anih hrĕng, na đak krong Jôrđăn 'blip tơ'bưh dang đêl, ro 'bĕnh thoi so."
"Now the people came up from the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and they camped in Gilgal on the east border of Jericho.","Năr mơjĭt khei mônh, kon pơlei tŏk hlôi kơ đak Krong Jôrđăn, pơm anih tơ Gilgal, gah hơlĕch kơ pơlei Jêrikô"
"And those twelve stones which they took out of the Jordan, Joshua set up in Gilgal.","Jôsuê pơdơ̆ng tơ Gilgal mơjĭt-'bar tŏ tơmo, mă đêl kon pơlei đei iŏk đơ̆ng lăm đak Krong Jôrđăn."
"Then he spoke to the children of Israel, saying: “When your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, ‘What are these stones?’","Sư khan kơ kon pơlei Isơrael: Ning-mônh, lu kon sâu lu iĕm jet 'bă lu sư: Lu tơmo âu wă khan kiơ?"
"then you shall let your children know, saying, ‘Israel crossed over this Jordan on dry land’","Lu iĕm gô khan kơ lu kon sâu: “Lu bơngai Isơrael tŏk hlôi kơ đak Krong Jôrđăn rok teh hrĕng."
"for the LORD your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until you had crossed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red Sea, which He dried up before us until we had crossed over","Yua kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu iĕm pơm ăn kơ đak Krong Jôrđăn hrơ̆ hrĕng 'bơ̆t anăp lu sư, dĭng mă lu sư tŏk hlôi, kiơ̆ thoi Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu iĕm kư̆m đei pơm kơ đak Dơsĭ 'Brê, hrơ̆ hrĕng 'bơ̆t lu bơ̆n, dĭng mă lu bơ̆n hlôi 'mơ̆i.”"
"that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of the LORD, that it is mighty, that you may fear the LORD your God forever.”","Kră Yang pơm thoi noh wă kơ đĭ-đăng adrĕch adrung lăm ala teh, băt kơ Kră Yang mơsêh pran kơtang, wă kơ rim 'nu lu iĕm chu kiơ̆ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu iĕm ling-lang."
"So it was, when all the kings of the Amorites who were on the west side of the Jordan, and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel until we had crossed over, that their heart melted; and there was no spirit in them any longer because of the children of Israel.","Kơplah pơtao đe Amôrit gah bơmơ̆t kơ đak Krong Jôrđăn păng đĭ-đăng lu pơtao đe Kanaan, oei jê̆ đak dơsĭ 'nao kơtơ̆ng khan Kră Yang đei pơm kơ Krong Jôrđăn hrơ̆ hrĕng, 'bơ̆t anăp lu kon pơlei Isơrael, dĭng mă lu sư yak tŏk hlôi kơ đak krong, na jơhngơ̆m lu pơtao hli tơtơ̆, mah pă pơ̆n tơ'bơ̆p hăm lu kon pơlei Isơrael."
"At that time the LORD said to Joshua, “Make flint knives for yourself, and circumcise the sons of Israel again the second time.”","Kơplah noh Kră Yang khan kơ Jôsuê: Pơm săng păng tơmo mă han na kăt tơdra akar tăl mă 'bar dơ̆ng kơ adrĕch adrung Isơrael."
"So Joshua made flint knives for himself, and circumcised the sons of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.","Thoi noh Jôsuê chă hơmet săng pơm păng tơmo kăt tơdra akar ăn kơ kon pơlei Isơrael tơ groi Gibêah Haralôt."
"And this is the reason why Joshua circumcised them: All the people who came out of Egypt who were males, all the men of war, had died in the wilderness on the way, after they had come out of Egypt.","Jôsuê kăt tơdra akar kơ lu sư yua kơ lu kon tơdăm trŏ kơ pơm linh lei, kơplah lu sư lĕch đơ̆ng dêh Êyiptơ, lôch rah rok trong lăm char glă đơ̆ng rŏng kơ lu sư lĕch hlôi đơ̆ng char Êyiptơ."
"For all the people who came out had been circumcised, but all the people born in the wilderness, on the way as they came out of Egypt, had not been circumcised.","Đĭ-đăng lu kon drŏ-nglo mă lĕch hlôi đơ̆ng dêh Êyiptơ, chu kăt tơdra akar ngăl, mă-lei lu bơngai mă tơpŭ kơplah lu sư oei rok trong tơ lăm char glă ưh tam kăt tơdra akar đơ̆ng rŏng kơ lu sư lĕch đơ̆ng Êyiptơ."
"For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people who were men of war, who came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they did not obey the voice of the LORD—to whom the LORD swore that He would not show them the land which the LORD had sworn to their fathers that He would give us, “a land flowing with milk and honey.”","Kon pơlei Isơrael hlôi yak năm wih wơ̆t lăm char glă puăn-jĭt sơnăm, dĭng mah truh tơ kon drŏ-nglo lôch đĭ noh lu bơngai trŏ kơ pơm linh kơplah lu sư 'nao lĕch đơ̆ng char Êyiptơ, yua kơ ưh kơ chu kiơ̆ kơ nơ̆r Kră Yang.

"Then Joshua circumcised their sons whom He raised up in their place; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised on the way.","Thoi noh Kră Yang tơiung lu kon drŏ-nglo lu sư tơplih lu sư, 'noh kon drŏ-nglo mă Jôsuê kăt tơdra akar kơ lu sư, lu sư ưh tam mă kăt tơdra akar yua kơ tơ rok trong ưh tam đei pơm giĕng kăt tơdra akar."
"So it was, when they had finished circumcising all the people, that they stayed in their places in the camp till they were healed.","Kơplah đe kăt tơdra akar ăn kơ đĭ-đăng lu drŏ-nglo đang boih, na lu sư oei tơ bơsŭn lu sư kơdih dĭng rơka lu sư klaih."
"Then the LORD said to Joshua, “This day I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you.” Therefore the name of the place is called Gilgal to this day.","Kơplah noh Kră Yang khan kơ Jôsuê: Năr âu Inh hŭt lê̆ boih tơdrong mơlâu lu iĕm đơ̆ng lu bơngai dêh Êyiptơ, lei na đe krao anăn anih âu Gilgal, mă truh dang ei."
"Now the children of Israel camped in Gilgal, and kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at twilight on the plains of Jericho.","Kon pơlei Isơrael pơm anih tơ Gilgal lăm Thŭng dơnă pơlei Jêrikô păng pơm giĕng Năm Brih kơplah drơ̆m kơsơ̆, trŏ kơ năr mơjĭt-puăn khei noh."
"And they ate of the produce of the land on the day after the Passover, unleavened bread and parched grain, on the very same day.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ năr pơm giĕng Năm Brih, năr noh boih kon pơlei sa tơmam đơ̆ng mir chŭn dêh noh, sa 'bĕng ưh kơ đei 'buih pông, păng sa găr 'ba hơdrĕng."
"Then the manna ceased on the day after they had eaten the produce of the land; and the children of Israel no longer had manna, but they ate the food of the land of Canaan that year.","Năr mă lu sư đei tơmam sa đơ̆ng mir chŭn dêh noh, truh pơgê năr đơ̆ng rŏng 'bĕng mana ưh pă jur; kon pơlei Isơrael ưh pă đei mana dơ̆ng, lei kơplah sơnăm noh lu sư sa tơmam đơ̆ng mir chŭn lăm teh tơring Kanaan."
"And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, a Man stood opposite him with His sword drawn in His hand. And Joshua went to Him and said to Him, “Are You for us or for our adversaries?”","Kơplah Jôsuê năm jê̆ pơlei Jêrikô, wă sư ngơk lăng, blư 'bôh hloi minh 'nu bơngai chĕp đao dơ̆ng tơklă 'bơ̆t anăp sư, Jôsuê năm tơ sư păng jet: Ih bơngai gah nhôn dah gah bơngai ayăt kơ nhôn?"
"So He said, “No, but as Commander of the army of the LORD I have now come.” And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and worshiped, and said to Him, “What does my Lord say to His servant?”","Sư tơl: Ưh, Inh Yŏng Linh Kră Yang. Jôsuê drap tơ teh kŭp kơ̆l kơkuh: Jet “Kră Yang athei đĭch đam Ih 'nâu pơm kiơ?”"
"Then the Commander of the LORD’s army said to Joshua, “Take your sandal off your foot, for the place where you stand is holy.” And Joshua did so.","Yŏng pơgơ̆r linh Kră Yang khan kơ Jôsuê: “Ih athei plôh chơkhŏ đơ̆ng jơ̆ng ih yua kơ anih ih oei dơ̆ng 'nâu anih rơgoh.” Jôsuê pơm kiơ̆ thoi noh."
"Now Jericho was securely shut up because of the children of Israel; none went out, and none came in.","Kơplah noh pơlei Jêrikô tang chơkăl đĭ-đăng 'măng jang boih, yua kơ lu bơngai Isơrael truh ưh pă đei bu mơ̆t dah lĕch."
"And the LORD said to Joshua: “See! I have given Jericho into your hand, its king, and the mighty men of valor.","Kră Yang khan kơ Jôsuê: Âu Inh jao boih pơlei Jêrikô, pơtao sư păng lu linh nuih pran sư lăm tơpang ti ih."
"You shall march around the city, all you men of war; you shall go all around the city once. This you shall do six days.","Lei ih hăm đĭ-đăng lu linh athei yak dăr tăp kơ pơlei âu minh wơ̆t, athei pơm thoi noh lăm tơdrâu năr."
"And seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark. But the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.","Tơpơh 'nu 'bok soi năm adrol kơ Hom Pơgơ̆p chĕp tơpơh tŏ tơgiĕp hơke bơbe bram, truh năr mă tơpơh, lu iĕm athei dăr jum dăr kơ pơlei noh tơpơh wơ̆t, hơdai hăm tơpơh 'nu 'bok soi hlôm tơgiĕp"
"It shall come to pass, when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, that all the people shall shout with a great shout; then the wall of the city will fall down flat. And the people shall go up every man straight before him.”","Mưh lu 'bok soi hlôm tơgiĕp re, lu iĕm kơtơ̆ng tơgiĕp hlôm re, đĭ-đăng kon pơlei pơla 'bơ̆r ôr jreo, na dur gô păk pơchah, kon pơlei gô tŏk hao mơ̆t rok tơklă anăp lu sư."
"Then Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the LORD.”","Thoi noh Jôsuê kon drŏ-nglo Nun, krao lu 'bok soi na khan: Tung bĕ Hom Pơgơ̆p păng tơpơh 'nu 'bok soi năm adrol kơ Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang, chĕp tơpơh tŏ tơgiĕp."
"And he said to the people, “Proceed, and march around the city, and let him who is armed advance before the ark of the LORD.”","Sư khan dơ̆ng kơ kon pơlei: Năm bĕ! Dăr tăp kơ pơlei hơdai păng lu bơngai chĕp khêl đao năm adrol kơ Hom Kră Yang."
"So it was, when Joshua had spoken to the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the LORD advanced and blew the trumpets, and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.","Lăp Jôsuê khan kơ kon pơlei đang boih, tơpơh 'nu 'bok soi chĕp tơpơh tŏ tơgiĕp năm tơ anăp Kră Yang, năm rah hlôm rah tơgiĕp Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang kiơ̆ đơ̆ng rŏng"
"The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, while the priests continued blowing the trumpets.","Lu bơngai chĕp đao kơtuang, năm adrol kơ lu 'bok soi hlôm tơgiĕp, khŭl linh kiơ̆ đơ̆ng rŏng Hom tơdrong pơgơ̆p, kơplah lu sư oei dăr năm rah hlôm rah tơgiĕp."
"Now Joshua had commanded the people, saying, “You shall not shout or make any noise with your voice, nor shall a word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I say to you, ‘Shout!’ Then you shall shout.”","Mă-lei Jôsuê khan dơ̆ng kơ kon pơlei: Lu iĕm lê̆ kơ ôr jreo, 'nĕ kơ pơma, 'nĕ kơ pơma dơnuh tơduă lu iĕm dĭng truh layơ mă inh athei: Ôr jreo bĕ 'bơ̆t noh kơnh lu iĕm ôr jreo."
"So he had the ark of the LORD circle the city, going around it once. Then they came into the camp and lodged in the camp.","Thoi noh Jôsuê athei đe tung Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang dăr kơ pơlei minh wơ̆t, đơ̆ng noh lu sư mơ̆t pơdơh tep kơmăng tơ anih."
"And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.","Pơgê đơ̆ng rŏng Jôsuê iung đơ̆ng hrôih păng lu 'bok soi tung Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang."
"Then seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually and blew with the trumpets. And the armed men went before them. But the rear guard came after the ark of the LORD, while the priests continued blowing the trumpets.","Tơpơh 'nu 'bok soi chĕp tơpơh tŏ tơgiĕp năm tơ anăp yak adrol kơ Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang hlôm rah; lu chĕp khêl đao kơtuang năm adrol kơ đĭ-đăng lu sư păng đei, khŭl linh năm kiơ̆ đơ̆ng rŏng Hom Kră Yang, 'bok soi yak rah hlôm rah tơgiĕp hơnơ̆ng."
"And the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp. So they did six days.","Năr mă 'bar lu sư năm yak tăp dăr kơ pơlei minh wơ̆t wih brŏk tơ anih, lu sư pơm thoi noh lăm tơdrâu năr."
"But it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose early, about the dawning of the day, and marched around the city seven times in the same manner. On that day only they marched around the city seven times.","Lăm năr mă tơpơh lu sư iung đơ̆ng hrôih, măt 'năr 'nao 'brưch hơdah, năm tăp dăr kơ pơlei tơpơh wơ̆t kư̆m thoi ki, lăp lăm năr noh đĕch lu sư năm tăp dăr kơ pơlei tơpơh wơ̆t"
"And the seventh time it happened, when the priests blew the trumpets, that Joshua said to the people: “Shout, for the LORD has given you the city!","Dăr wơ̆t mă tơpơh, lu 'bok soi hlôm tơgiĕp re pơhioi na Jôsuê khan kơ kon pơlei: Ôr jreo pơret bĕ, yua kơ Kră Yang jao ăn pơlei âu kơ lu iĕm boih."
"Now the city shall be doomed by the LORD to destruction, it and all who are in it. Only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.","Pơlei păng tôm tơmam lăm noh, athei pơyơ̆r kơ Kră Yang nhen thoi tơmam trŏ kơ pơlôch pơrăm; lăp minh 'nu Rahap drŏ-kăn đi păng đĭ-đăng bơngai oei lăm hnam sư đĕch gô arih, yua kơ sư đei ôn boih bre 'bar 'nu bơngai năm chop lăng mă inh đei wơh."
"And you, by all means abstain from the accursed things, lest you become accursed when you take of the accursed things, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.","Mă-lei iĕm athei kơchăng kơ tơmam lu iĕm hlôi pơrăm, wă kơ lu iĕm huay kơ lôch răm yua kơ iŏk lu tơmam noh, tơdah kon pơlei ưh kơ chu pơm kiơ̆ lei lu iĕm pơm kơđông linh Isơrael kư̆m lôch răm, pŭ iŏk tơdrong răm."
"But all the silver and gold, and vessels of bronze and iron, are consecrated to the LORD; they shall come into the treasury of the LORD.”","Hu, maih păng đĭ-đăng tơmam pơm hăm kong mam 'măn lê̆ pha kơ Kră Yang, tơmam noh rơgoh gô tah tơmơ̆t lăm hnam mong tơmam Kră Yang."
"So the people shouted when the priests blew the trumpets. And it happened when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat. Then the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.","Kon pơlei ôr păng lu 'bok soi hlôm tơgiĕp re pơhioi.

"And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, ox and sheep and donkey, with the edge of the sword.","Iŏk đao pơlôch đĭ bơngai lăm pơlei noh, drŏ-nglo, kră, hơ'lơ̆p, truh tơ sem dơrong: Rơmo, triu păng aseh iĕ."
"But Joshua had said to the two men who had spied out the country, “Go into the harlot’s house, and from there bring out the woman and all that she has, as you swore to her.”","Jôsuê khan kơ bre 'bar 'nu bơngai mă chop lăng pơlei noh: Măr iĕm năm mơ̆t bĕ tơ hnam Rahap drŏ-kăn đi athei lu sư lĕch, thoi măr iĕm mă đei pơkă hăm sư."
"And the young men who had been spies went in and brought out Rahab, her father, her mother, her brothers, and all that she had. So they brought out all her relatives and left them outside the camp of Israel.","Thoi noh bre 'bar 'nu bơngai chop lăng noh mơ̆t athei Rahap, mĕ 'bă sư, 'nhŏng oh, lĕch chông ba lu sư đĭ, bre 'bar 'nu bơngai noh chông ba đĭ hnam dơnŏ hăm sư păng ba lu sư oei gah 'nguaih kơ kơđông linh Isơrael."
"But they burned the city and all that was in it with fire. Only the silver and gold, and the vessels of bronze and iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.","Đơ̆ng noh lu sư soh rông chhông đĭ hnam lăm pơlei păng đĭ lu tơmam lăm noh, Hu, Maih, kong, mam đĕch tah lăm hnam mong tơmam Kră Yang."
"And Joshua spared Rahab the harlot, her father’s household, and all that she had. So she dwells in Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.","Thoi noh Jôsuê wei-lăng tơdrong arih Rahap bơngai drŏ-kăn đi, hăm đĭ-đăng lu bơngai lăm hnam dơnŏ 'bă sư, lu sư oei hơdai hăm lu bơngai Isơrael, truh tơ dang ei, yua kơ sư đei ôn bre bơngai chop lăng, mă Jôsuê wơh năm chop lăng pơlei Jêrikô."
"Then Joshua charged them at that time, saying, “Cursed be the man before the LORD who rises up and builds this city Jericho; he shall lay its foundation with his firstborn, and with his youngest he shall set up its gates.”","Kơplah noh Jôsuê pơma pơkă pơkăm thoi âu: Bơngai bu man pơdơ̆ng ming pơlei Jêrikô, đe gô hiap pơtê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang!

"So the LORD was with Joshua, and his fame spread throughout all the country.","Kră Yang oei hơdai Jôsuê, đe ư-ang anăn sư jơ̆p-jang lăm char sư."
"But the children of Israel committed a trespass regarding the accursed things, for Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed things; so the anger of the LORD burned against the children of Israel.","Kon pơlei Isơrael đei pơm tơdrong yoch ưh kơ chu gah tơmam trŏ kơ pơyơ̆r; păng pơrăm Akan kon drŏ-nglo Karmi, sâu Sapđi, sâu i Sêra, đơ̆ng adrĕch Juđa, đei iŏk tơmam trŏ kơ soh pơrăm lê̆ păng trŏ kơ pơyơ̆r noh, lei Kră Yang, hil mĭl kơ kon pơlei Isơrael."
"Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth Aven, on the east side of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, “Go up and spy out the country.” So the men went up and spied out Ai.","Đơ̆ng Jêrikô Jôsuê wơh bơngai năm chop lăng pơlei Ahi, Jê̆ Bêt Awen, gah hơlĕch kơ Bethel na khan: Năm chop lăng bĕ tơring noh. Lei na lu sư năm chop lăng pơlei Ahi."
"And they returned to Joshua and said to him, “Do not let all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and attack Ai. Do not weary all the people there, for the people of Ai are few.”","Lu sư wih brŏk tơ Jôsuê păng khan: Ưh kơ kăl kơ chông ba đĭ kon pơlei năm tơ noh ôh, tơdrong kơ đei, ih athei ăn dang 'bar dah pêng-rơbâu 'nu bơngai đĕch, năm tơblah pơlei Ahi, 'nĕ kơ ăn đĭ kon pơlei năm gleh lap tơ noh, yua kơ bơngai pơlei Ahi lăp tŏ sĕt đĕch."
"So about three thousand men went up there from the people, but they fled before the men of Ai.","Thoi noh, đei dang pêng-rơbâu 'nu bơngai tŏk năm tơblah tơ noh, mă-lei lu sư kơdâu tơklah tơklang kơ bơngai pơlei Ahi."
"And the men of Ai struck down about thirty-six men, for they chased them from before the gate as far as Shebarim, and struck them down on the descent; therefore the hearts of the people melted and became like water.","Bơngai pơlei Ahi pơlôch dang pêng-jĭt tơdrâu 'nu, druh lu linh Isơrael đơ̆ng 'măng dur pơlei truh tơ Sêbarim, blah lu sư kơplah lu sư jur tơ krang, jơhngơ̆m lu sư hli tơrơ thoi đak ro"
"Then Joshua tore his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of the LORD until evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads.","Jôsuê hek ao sư kơdih, sư păng lu kră pơlei Isơrael, drap tơ teh kŭp kơ̆l 'bơ̆t anăp Hom Kră Yang truh tơ kơsơ̆ măng păng chup 'mui teh klă 'bĕnh kơ kơ̆l lu sư kơdih."
"And Joshua said, “Alas, Lord GOD, why have You brought this people over the Jordan at all—to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? Oh, that we had been content, and dwelt on the other side of the Jordan!","Jôsuê khan: Ô Kră Yang inh, liơ mă Kră Yang ăn kon pơlei âu tŏk hlôi kơ đak Krong Jôrđăn, wă jao ăn lu nhôn răm lăm ti lu bơngai Amôrit pơlôch đĭ.

"O Lord, what shall I say when Israel turns its back before its enemies?","Ơu! Ơ Kră Yang! Lei inh wă gơh pơma liơ dơ̆ng? Kon pơlei Isơrael đe đĭ druh blah."
"For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear it, and surround us, and cut off our name from the earth. Then what will You do for Your great name?”","Tơdah kon pơlei Kanaan păng đĭ-đăng kon pơlei oei lăm char âu, gô kơtơ̆ng tơdrong âu, lu sư gô wang nhôn păng sŭt lê̆ anăn lu nhôn đơ̆ng teh âu, lei Ih wă pơm thoi yơ, yua kơ Anăn Ih Tih hloh."
"So the LORD said to Joshua: “Get up! Why do you lie thus on your face?","Kră Yang khan kơ Jôsuê, Iung bĕ, liơ kŭp muh măt tơ teh thoi noh?"
"Israel has sinned, and they have also transgressed My covenant which I commanded them. For they have even taken some of the accursed things, and have both stolen and deceived; and they have also put it among their own stuff.","Bơngai Isơrael đei pơm tơdrong yoch boih, lu sư ưh kơ wă pơm kiơ̆ tơdrong pơgơ̆p mă Inh đei pơkă ăn kơ lu sư athei răk, lu sư iŏk bơih tơmam trŏ kơ pơyơ̆r păng pơrăm pơma hơlĕnh, lu sư tơtông iŏk tơmam noh tah lê̆ lăm kơdŭng lu sư kơdih"
"Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they have become doomed to destruction. Neither will I be with you anymore, unless you destroy the accursed from among you.","yua kơ thoi noh, kon pơlei Isơrael ưh kơ kĕ tơblah hăm lu bơngai ayăt kơ lu sư ôh, lu sư kơdŭn tơ rŏng kơdâu ôn, pơm kơdih pŭ iŏk tơdrong pơlôch pơrăm.

"Get up, sanctify the people, and say, ‘Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, because thus says the LORD God of Israel: “There is an accursed thing in your midst, O Israel; you cannot stand before your enemies until you take away the accursed thing from among you.”","Iung bĕ pơm kơ kon pơlei rơgoh păng khan: Hơmet bĕ lu iĕm kơdih mă rơgoh, kơ năr dơning, yua kơ 'nâu nơ̆r Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael đei khan: Ơ lu bơngai Isơrael, tơ lăm lu iĕm đei tơmam mă trŏ kơ pơyơ̆r păng pơrăm.

"In the morning therefore you shall be brought according to your tribes. And it shall be that the tribe which the LORD takes shall come according to families; and the family which the LORD takes shall come by households; and the household which the LORD takes shall come man by man.","Lei na dơning lu iĕm athei năm pơdah akâu kiơ̆ kơ adrĕch adrung lu iĕm, adrĕch adrung ayơ mă Kră Yang tơhlâu, năm hloi tơ hnam dơnŏ, hnam dơnŏ ayơ mă Kră Yang tơhlâu, năm hloi tơ rim 'nu."
"Then it shall be that he who is taken with the accursed thing shall be burned with fire, he and all that he has, because he has transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he has done a disgraceful thing in Israel.’ ”","Bơngai bu mă đei tơhlâu, bơngai noh boih đei iŏk tơmam pơyơ̆r, pơlôch bơngai noh lăm ŭnh hơdai hăm lu tơmam sư, yua kơ sư pơm glăi kơ nơ̆r pơgơ̆p Kră Yang pơm ăn kơ adrĕch Isơrael mơlâu."
"So Joshua rose early in the morning and brought Israel by their tribes, and the tribe of Judah was taken.","Thoi noh Jôsuê iung đơ̆ng hrôih, chông ba lu bơngai Isơrael năm akŭm, kiơ̆ kơ adrĕch lu sư Kră Yang tơhlâu tơ'bôh lăm adrĕch Juđa."
"He brought the clan of Judah, and he took the family of the Zarhites; and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man, and Zabdi was taken.","Sư ăn adrĕch Juđa năm jê̆ Kră Yang tơhlâu kơ adrĕch Sêra, sư ăn adrĕch Sêra năm jê̆, kiơ̆ kơ hnam dơnŏ Kră Yang tơhlâu kơ hnam dơnŏ Sapđi đei iŏk."
"Then he brought his household man by man, and Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.","Sư ăn kơ hnam dơnŏ Sapđi năm jê̆ minh 'nu minh 'nu, na Kră Yang tơhlâu Akan kon drŏ-nglo Karmi, sâu Sapđi, sâu i Sêra, đơ̆ng adrĕch adrung Juđa."
"Now Joshua said to Achan, “My son, I beg you, give glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession to Him, and tell me now what you have done; do not hide it from me.”","Jôsuê khan kơ Akan: Ô dăm!

"And Achan answered Joshua and said, “Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and this is what I have done","Akan tơl Jôsuê: Trŏ tơpă, inh đei pơm tơdrong yoch hăm Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael. 'Nâu tơdrong inh đei pơm boih."
"When I saw among the spoils a beautiful Babylonian garment, two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold weighing fifty shekels, I coveted them and took them. And there they are, hidden in the earth in the midst of my tent, with the silver under it.”","Inh đei 'bôh minh blah ao tai Sinêa 'lơ̆ng, lăm tơmam blah tơgar iŏk, 2 kĭ 30grama jên hu, minh tơpei maih, trăp 0 kĭ 600gram binh wă dêh tơmam noh, iŏk ôn lê̆ 'bŭ lăm teh, tŏk-bŏk anih bơsŭn inh, hu 'bŭ sư tơ ala."
"So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and there it was, hidden in his tent, with the silver under it.","Jôsuê wơh bơngai năm tơ bơsŭn, 'bôh ao tai tơ noh păng hu 'bŭ tơ ala."
"And they took them from the midst of the tent, brought them to Joshua and to all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD.","Sư kôch iŏk tơmam lăm tŏk-bŏk bơsŭn, chĕp ba ăn kơ Jôsuê păng tơ'bôh kơ đĭ-đăng kon pơlei Isơrael, dan 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang."
"Then Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, the silver, the garment, the wedge of gold, his sons, his daughters, his oxen, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and all that he had, and they brought them to the Valley of Achor.","Jôsuê păng đĭ-đăng kon pơlei Isơrael rôp Akan, sâu Sêra, iŏk Hu, ao tai, tơpei Maih, lu kon drŏ-nglo, drŏ-kăn sư, lu rơmo, aseh iĕ, triu păng hnam bơsŭn păng đĭ kơ dôm tơmam sư, chông chĕp ba sư tơ lăm thŭng pŭng-lŭng Akôr."
"And Joshua said, “Why have you troubled us? The LORD will trouble you this day.” So all Israel stoned him with stones; and they burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones.","Jôsuê khan: Yua kơ kiơ ih pơm tơdrong răm kơ lu bơ̆n?

"Then they raised over him a great heap of stones, still there to this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of His anger. Therefore the name of that place has been called the Valley of Achor to this day.","Lu sư dan lê̆ tơmo, tơ kơpal akâu Akan lôch, hơlôk dang ei oei đei, Kră Yang huay pă hil mĭl, đơ̆ng noh truh tơ dang ei, đe krao anih noh thŭng Akôr.c"
"Now the LORD said to Joshua: “Do not be afraid, nor be dismayed; take all the people of war with you, and arise, go up to Ai. See, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, his people, his city, and his land.","Kơplah noh, Kră Yang khan kơ Jôsuê: Ih 'nĕ kơ hli tơrơ, chông ba đĭ-đăng lu linh hơdai ih, iung năm blah bĕ pơlei Ahi, to Inh jao sư lăm tơpang ti ih, pơtao Ahi, kon pơlei sư, pơlei hăm tơring noh."
"And you shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king. Only its spoil and its cattle you shall take as booty for yourselves. Lay an ambush for the city behind it.”","Ih blah pơm bĕ kơ pơlei Ahi, hăm pơtao, sư thoi ih pơm boih kơ pơlei Jêrikô păng pơtao sư, pha 'biơ̆ minh tơdrong, lu iĕm gơh iŏk yua kơdih sem dơrong lu sư, hăm dôm tơmam iĕm blah iŏk.

"So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai; and Joshua chose thirty thousand mighty men of valor and sent them away by night.","Thoi noh Jôsuê iung hơdai hăm lu linh năm tŏk blah pơlei Ahi, Jôsuê rơih iŏk pêng-jĭt rơbâu 'nu bơngai nuih kơtang, athei lu sư yak năm kơmăng"
"And he commanded them, saying: “Behold, you shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city. Do not go very far from the city, but all of you be ready.","Sư pơkă khan: Lu iĕm răp tơ gah rŏng kơ pơlei, 'nĕ kơ răp ataih kơ pơlei ôh, lu iĕm răp mă kơchăng hơmăt ling-lang."
"Then I and all the people who are with me will approach the city; and it will come about, when they come out against us as at the first, that we shall flee before them.","Inh hăm lu bơngai kiơ̆ inh, năm jê̆ tơ anăp pơlei noh, tơdah lu sư năm blah lu nhôn thoi adrol ki, lu nhôn pơm kơdâu kơ lu sư"
"For they will come out after us till we have drawn them from the city, for they will say, ‘They are fleeing before us as at the first.’ Therefore we will flee before them.","lê̆ lu sư druh lu nhôn, lu nhôn pơm kơdâu dĭng mă ataih đơ̆ng pơlei boih, lu sư gô khan: Lu sư kơdâu kơ lu bơ̆n thoi ki mơ̆n, thoi noh nhôn pơm kơdâu kơ lu sư"
"Then you shall rise from the ambush and seize the city, for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.","lu iĕm lĕch đơ̆ng anih iĕm răp iung kơdâu năm mơ̆t blah iŏk pơlei; Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu bơ̆n gô ăn pơlei noh tơ lăm tơpang ti lu bơ̆n."
"And it will be, when you have taken the city, that you shall set the city on fire. According to the commandment of the LORD you shall do. See, I have commanded you.”","Mưh lu iĕm đei iŏk boih pơlei, lu iĕm athei soh pơlei noh, athei pơm kiơ̆ thoi Kră Yang đei ată, lăng hŏ inh pơkă boih kơ lu iĕm"
"Joshua therefore sent them out; and they went to lie in ambush, and stayed between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai; but Joshua lodged that night among the people.","Jôsuê athei lu linh năm răp sơlam pơlei Bethel păng pơlei Ahi, gah bơmơ̆t kơ pơlei Ahi, Jôsuê măng noh oei hơdai hăm kon pơlei"
"Then Joshua rose up early in the morning and mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.","Pơgê đơ̆ng rŏng Jôsuê iung đơ̆ng hrôih, jô̆ lu linh sư, sư păng lu kră pơgơ̆r năm adrol kơ lu linh truh tơ pơlei Ahi"
"And all the people of war who were with him went up and drew near; and they came before the city and camped on the north side of Ai. Now a valley lay between them and Ai.","Đĭ-đăng lu linh kiơ̆ Jôsuê năm jê̆ tơ tơklă anăp pơlei păng pơm anih gah yă-nơ̆m kơ pơlei Ahi, tơ pŭng-lŭng thŭng să sơlam lu sư hăm pơlei Ahi"
"So he took about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.","Jôsuê ăn boih linh dang pơđăm-rơbâu 'nu drŏ-nglo răp găn sơlam pơlei Bethel hăm pơlei Ahi, gah bơmơ̆t kơ pơlei."
"And when they had set the people, all the army that was on the north of the city, and its rear guard on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.","Đang kơ dan lê̆ lu linh răp gah yă-nơ̆m, kơ pơlei tih păng ăn lê̆ lu linh găn răp gah bơmơ̆t. Lăm măng noh, Jôsuê năm jur tơ lăm thŭng"
"Now it happened, when the king of Ai saw it, that the men of the city hurried and rose early and went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at an appointed place before the plain. But he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city.","Wă pơtao Ahi 'bôh tơdrong noh, lu sư hăt hot iung đơ̆ng hrôih, pơtao hăm kon pơlei sư sơng blah Isơrael, tơ anih tơmang 'bôh Araba. Mă-lei pơtao ưh kơ băt, đei minh khŭl linh răp tơ gah rŏng kơ pơlei"
"And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.","Jôsuê păng đĭ-đăng kon pơlei Isơrael, lê̆ lu ayăt năm blah, pơm thuơ, na kơdâu tơklă tơ lăm thŭng glă."
"So all the people who were in Ai were called together to pursue them. And they pursued Joshua and were drawn away from the city.","Krao đĭ-đăng lu bơngai drŏ-nglo lăm pơlei Ahi, wă druh lu ayăt. Lu sư druh Jôsuê pơrơi lu sư ataih đơ̆ng pơlei"
"There was not a man left in Ai or Bethel who did not go out after Israel. So they left the city open and pursued Israel.","ưh pă đei minh 'nu drŏ-nglo bu oei lăm pơlei Ahi hăm pơlei Bethel. Đĭ-đăng hăt kơ druh lu linh Isơrael, lu sư achăng lê̆ pơlei."
"Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Stretch out the spear that is in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand.” And Joshua stretched out the spear that was in his hand toward the city.","Kơplah noh Kră Yang khan kơ Jôsuê: Yơ̆r tơju ih, tơ gah pơlei Ahi, Inh jao ăn pơlei noh lăm tơpang ti ih, Jôsuê hiŏng yơ̆r tơju sư tơklă pơlei Ahi."
"So those in ambush arose quickly out of their place; they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and they entered the city and took it, and hurried to set the city on fire.","Lăp Jôsuê yơ̆r ti sư lu linh răp noh iung, kơdâu năm blah iŏk hloi pơlei păng soh hloi pơlei noh."
"And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and behold, the smoke of the city ascended to heaven. So they had no power to flee this way or that way, and the people who had fled to the wilderness turned back on the pursuers.","Lu bơngai drŏ-nglo pơlei Ahi wih lăng tơ rŏng 'bôh đei 'nhui ŭnh đe soh pơlei đông tơ kơpal plĕnh.

"Now when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that the smoke of the city ascended, they turned back and struck down the men of Ai.","Jôsuê păng lu linh Isơrael, 'bôh lu linh răp noh đei iŏk boih pơlei Ahi păng 'bôh 'nhui ŭnh đông kơjung, lu sư wih tơ rŏng blah lu linh pơlei Ahi"
"Then the others came out of the city against them; so they were caught in the midst of Israel, some on this side and some on that side. And they struck them down, so that they let none of them remain or escape.","lu linh răp lĕch đơ̆ng pơlei kư̆m năm blah lu bơngai Ahi, thoi noh lu linh Ahi tŏk-bŏk, lu linh Isơrael, găn wang tăp 'bar pah. Lu linh Isơrael blah pơlôch lu sư ưh pă đei bu oei arih păng klaih hlôi."
"But the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.","Lu linh Isơrael rôp arih pơtao pơlei Ahi, chông ba sư tơ Jôsuê"
"And it came to pass when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness where they pursued them, and when they all had fallen by the edge of the sword until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned to Ai and struck it with the edge of the sword.","Đang kơ lu linh Isơrael pơlôch đĭ boih bơngai pơlei Ahi, lăm anih thŭng glă mă lu đei druh, lu sư pơlôch đĭ hăm đao gưm boih, lu linh Isơrael wih mơ̆t tơ pơlei Ahi păng pơlôch pơđĭ lu bơngai mă oei arih lăm pơlei."
"So it was that all who fell that day, both men and women, were twelve thousand—all the people of Ai.","Đe pơlôch lu bơngai Ahi lăm năr noh, đĭ-đăng lu bơngai drŏ-nglo păng drŏ-kăn đei mơjĭt-'bar rơbâu 'nu."
"For Joshua did not draw back his hand, with which he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.","Jôsuê ưh kơ đei kơchôt chĕp tơju yơ̆r ti sư hơnơ̆ng, gô dĭng mă pơlôch pơrăm đĭ lu bơngai Ahi 'mơ̆i."
"Only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took as booty for themselves, according to the word of the LORD which He had commanded Joshua.","Kon pơlei Isơrael blah iŏk kơdih lu sem dơrong păng lu mŭk tơmam pơlei âu, trŏ thoi Kră Yang pơkă boih kơ Jôsuê"
"So Joshua burned Ai and made it a heap forever, a desolation to this day.","Thoi noh Jôsuê prah ŭnh soh, pơm kơ pơlei Ahi pơchah răm jing juơ tơtŭng, dĭng truh tơ dang ei."
"And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until evening. And as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his corpse down from the tree, cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raise over it a great heap of stones that remains to this day.","Jôsuê hrek hơtol lê̆ pơtao Ahi, 'bơ̆t tơm 'long truh kơsơ̆, truh 'năr wă mơ̆t, Jôsuê athei đe tơjur đơ̆ng tơm 'long, klơ̆m hơtat lê̆ 'bơ̆t 'măng jang mơ̆t tơ pơlei, đe dan tơmo kơpal akâu pơtao lôch minh pôi tih oei đei dĭng truh tơ dang ei."
"Now Joshua built an altar to the LORD God of Israel in Mount Ebal","Jôsuê đei pơdơ̆ng chơnang soi kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei adrĕch Isơrael, tơ kông Êbal."
"as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the Book of the Law of Moses: “an altar of whole stones over which no man has wielded an iron tool.” And they offered on it burnt offerings to the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings.","Kiơ̆ thoi Môis, đĭch đam Kră Yang, đei bơtho pơkă boih kơ kon pơlei Isơrael, Jôsuê man pơdơ̆ng chơnang soi noh kiơ̆ trŏ thoi đei chih lăm sơ̆p hla bơar khôi juăt Môis pơkă man hăm minh pôm tơmo tih, ưh kơ yua hăm bơsei ôh, lu sư pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'buh kơ Kră Yang păng pơyơ̆r tơmam soi apinh hiôk-hian tơ noh."
"And there, in the presence of the children of Israel, he wrote on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written.","Tơ noh Jôsuê rek chih khôi juăt lăm tơmo, mă kiơ̆ kơ Môis đei chih adrol sơ̆, 'bơ̆t anăp kon pơlei Isơrael."
"Then all Israel, with their elders and officers and judges, stood on either side of the ark before the priests, the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, the stranger as well as he who was born among them. Half of them were in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.","Đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael, kon pơlei hăm lu bơngai tơmoi, hơdai hăm lu kră pơlei, lu kră pơgơ̆r, lu kră sek tơlang, dơ̆ng 'bar pah kơ Hom Pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'bơ̆t anăp lu bơngai tung Hom tơdrong pơgơ̆p noh lu 'bok soi bơngai Lêwi, minh puăt kon pơlei dơ̆ng gah anăp kơ Kông Gêrasim, minh puăt gah anăp Kông Êbal kiơ̆ thoi Môis, đĭch đam Kră Yang, đei tơtă boih adrol sơ̆ kơplah sư sơkat ăn pŭn hiôk kơ kon pơlei Isơrael."
"And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and the cursings, according to all that is written in the Book of the Law.","Jôsuê đŏk đĭ nơ̆r khôi juăt, tơdrong sơkat hơpơi pŭn hiôk dah tơdrong sơkat hiap pơtê̆, đei chih lăm sơ̆p hla bơar khôi juăt."
"There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded which Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel, with the women, the little ones, and the strangers who were living among them.","Ưh kơ đei nơ̆r ayơ Môis đei bơtho khan, mă Jôsuê ưh kơ đŏk ưh kơ roi tơbăt ăn kơ bơngai Isơrael, mă drŏ-kăn, hơ'lơ̆p păng mă tơmoi oei hơdai lu sư."
"And it came to pass when all the kings who were on this side of the Jordan, in the hills and in the lowland and in all the coasts of the Great Sea toward Lebanon—the Hittite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite—heard about it","Đĭ-đăng lu pơtao gah bơmơ̆t kơ đak Krong Jôrđăn đei kơtơ̆ng tơdrong âu, lu pơtao oei lăm bri kông, lăm thŭng dơnă, ala jơ̆ng kông gah bơmơ̆t păng tơring rok tơter đak Dơsĭ Tih truh tơ Liban, noh lu pơtao kon pơlei Hêtit, kon pơlei Amôrit, kon pơlei Kanaan, kon pơlei Perêsit, kon pơlei Hêwit, kon pơlei Jêbus"
"that they gathered together to fight with Joshua and Israel with one accord.","hơdai minh jơhngơ̆m đon wă blah Jôsuê hăm kon pơlei Isơrael."
"But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai","Lăp kon pơlei Gibeôn kơtơ̆ng khan Jôsuê blah pơlei Jêrikô păng pơlei Ahi"
"they worked craftily, and went and pretended to be ambassadors. And they took old sacks on their donkeys, old wineskins torn and mended","lu sư chă đon hơlĕnh, lu sư hơmet hao aseh iĕ, iŏk 'bi so chơ hơtŏk tơ kơdŭ aseh păng iŏk get akar mong sik hơmu đĭ hiah, sĭt hơmet."
"old and patched sandals on their feet, and old garments on themselves; and all the bread of their provision was dry and moldy.","Jơ̆ng lu sư 'bot chơkhŏ so, sĭt klĕp hrŭk ao so hiah hiot, đĭ-đăng tơmam sa lu sư đĭ kro krĕnh đĭ phơ̆k"
"And they went to Joshua, to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him and to the men of Israel, “We have come from a far country; now therefore, make a covenant with us.”","Lu sư năm truh tơ Jôsuê lăm anih tơ Gilgal.

"Then the men of Israel said to the Hivites, “Perhaps you dwell among us; so how can we make a covenant with you?”","Mă-lei kon pơlei Isơrael tơl lu bơngai Hêwit: Băt lu iĕm oei jê̆ lu nhôn. Pơm liơ bơ̆n gơh pơgơ̆p băl?"

"So they said to him: “From a very far country your servants have come, because of the name of the LORD your God; for we have heard of His fame, and all that He did in Egypt","Lu sư tơl, lu đĭch đam ih âu đơ̆ng dêh ataih kơtơ̆ng ang kơ anăn Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ih, yua kơ lu nhôn đei kơtơ̆ng boih đe roi gah Kră Yang păng tôm tơdrong Kră Yang hlôi pơm boih lăm char Êyiptơ."

"Therefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, ‘Take provisions with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, “We are your servants; now therefore, make a covenant with us.” ’","Lu kră pơlei nhôn hăm đĭ-đăng lu kon pơlei mă oei lăm char nhôn khan kơ lu nhôn.

"This bread of ours we took hot for our provision from our houses on the day we departed to come to you. But now look, it is dry and moldy.","Âu lăng 'bĕng mi lu nhôn, chĕp đơ̆ng hnam oei tơtŏ wă năm tơ âu, dang ei đĭ kro krĕnh đĭ phơ̆k phok."
"And these wineskins which we filled were new, and see, they are torn; and these our garments and our sandals have become old because of the very long journey.”","Lu get akar kơplah nhôn mong sik hơmu oei 'nao oei hơnĭl, lăng âu đĭ pơchah păng hơbĕn ao, chơkhŏ lu nhôn đĭ so hiah, yua kơ năm trong ataih."
"Then the men of Israel took some of their provisions; but they did not ask counsel of the LORD.","Lu bơngai Isơrael iŏk tơmam sa lu sư, mă-lei ưh kơ đei krao apinh Kră Yang."
"So Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them to let them live; and the rulers of the congregation swore to them.","Jôsuê pơm tơdrong hiôk păng pơgơ̆p hăm lu sư păng lê̆ lu sư oei arih. Lu kră pơgơ̆r lăm khŭl akŭm pơkă pơkăm hăm lu sư."
"And it happened at the end of three days, after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors who dwelt near them.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ pêng năr, wă đang pơgơ̆p hăm bơngai Gibeôn, kon pơlei Isơrael băt, kơ lu bơngai âu tơring kơdih oei jê̆ lu sư."
"Then the children of Israel journeyed and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kirjath Jearim.","Kon pơlei Isơrael yak năm năr mă pêng truh tơ pơlei lu sư, pơlei Gibeôn, Kêphira, Bêrôt păng Kiriat, Jêrim."
"But the children of Israel did not attack them, because the rulers of the congregation had sworn to them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation complained against the rulers.","Mă-lei kon pơlei Isơrael ưh kơ đei blah lu sư ôh, yua kơ lu kră pơlei wei-lăng khŭl akŭm lu sư đei pơkă pơkăm boih hăm lu sư krao anăn Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael.

"Then all the rulers said to all the congregation, “We have sworn to them by the LORD God of Israel; now therefore, we may not touch them.","Mă-lei lu kră tơl khan: Lu bơ̆n pơkă pơkăm hăm lu sư pao anăn Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael, na dang ei lu bơ̆n ưh kơ gơh hơtŭt pơrăm lu sư."
"This we will do to them: We will let them live, lest wrath be upon us because of the oath which we swore to them.”","'Nâu lu bơ̆n athei pơm kơ lu sư thoi âu: Ăn kơ lu sư oei arih, lei Kră Yang huay kơ hil mĭl kơ bơ̆n. Yua kơ lu bơ̆n đei pơkă pơkăm hăm lu sư boih."
"And the rulers said to them, “Let them live, but let them be woodcutters and water carriers for all the congregation, as the rulers had promised them.”","Lu kră wei-lăng Isơrael khan dơ̆ng lê̆ lu sư arih, mă-lei lê̆ lu sư chă kăl 'long ŭnh, chhŏ đak ăn kơ lu khŭl tơpôl.

"Then Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, “Why have you deceived us, saying, ‘We are very far from you,’ when you dwell near us?","Jôsuê krao kon pơlei Gibeôn khan kơ lu sư: Liơ lu iĕm hơlĕnh pơhlŭ lu nhôn khan: Lu nhôn oei ataih dêh đơ̆ng lu iĕm, mă-lei lu iĕm oei jê̆ lu nhôn."
"Now therefore, you are cursed, and none of you shall be freed from being slaves—woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God.”","Dang ei đe hiap pơtê̆ boih, đĭ-đăng lu iĕm gô pơm đĭch, mơ'nah lu iĕm chă kăl 'long ŭnh, tung đak, lăm hnam 'Bok Kei-Dei inh."
"So they answered Joshua and said, “Because your servants were clearly told that the LORD your God commanded His servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you; therefore we were very much afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing.","Lu sư tơl Jôsuê.

"And now, here we are, in your hands; do with us as it seems good and right to do to us.”","Dang ei lu nhôn oei lăm tơpang ti iĕm, mơ̆ng kơ iĕm wă pơm kơ lu nhôn, kiơ̆ kơ iĕm lăng 'lơ̆ng dah trŏ."
"So he did to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, so that they did not kill them.","Jôsuê pơm kiơ̆ thoi nơ̆r lu sư pơma, pơklaih lu sư đơ̆ng ti lu bơngai Isơrael wă pơlôch."
"And that day Joshua made them woodcutters and water carriers for the congregation and for the altar of the LORD, in the place which He would choose, even to this day.","Đơ̆ng năr noh chă wơh ăn lu sư chă kăl 'long ŭnh, chhŏ đak kơ khŭl tơpôl păng kơ chơnang soi Kră Yang kiơ̆ kơ anih mă Kră Yang đei rơih iŏk, noh tơdrong jang kơ lu sư noh dĭng truh tơ dang ei."
"Now it came to pass when Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai and had utterly destroyed it—as he had done to Jericho and its king, so he had done to Ai and its king—and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were among them","Adônisêdek, pơtao pơlei Jêrusalem, kơtơ̆ng khan Jôsuê blah iŏk boih pơlei Ahi păng pơrăm pơlôch đĭ, pơm kơ pơlei păng pơtao sư, thoi sư đei pơm kơ pơlei Jêrikô păng kơ pơtao sư păng kư̆m kơtơ̆ng kon pơlei Gibeôn pơgơ̆p hiôk-hian hăm kon pơlei Isơrael boih păng oei hơdai lu sư."
"that they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty.","Pơtao păng đĭ kon pơlei hli dêh, yua kơ pơlei Gibeôn pơlei tih, pơlei pơtao yŏng mơng tih hloh kơ pơlei Ahi, lu kon drŏ-nglo kon pơlei lu sư nuih pran kơtang."
"Therefore Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish, and Debir king of Eglon, saying","Thoi noh Adônisêdek, pơtao pơlei Jêrusalem, krao pơtơm Hôham pơtao pơlei Hêbrôn, Phiram pơtao pơlei Jarmut, Japhia pơtao pơlei Lakis păng Đêbir pơtao Eglôn na khan"
"“Come up to me and help me, that we may attack Gibeon, for it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.”","Lu iĕm tŏk dŏng inh bĕ, bơ̆n năm tơblah pơlei Gibeôn, yua kơ lu sư đei pơgơ̆p hơdai hăm Jôsuê păng kon pơlei Isơrael."
"Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, gathered together and went up, they and all their armies, and camped before Gibeon and made war against it.","Thoi noh pơđăm 'nu pơtao bơngai Amôrit, wă khan pơtao pơlei Jêrusalem, pơtao pơlei Hêbrôn, pơtao Jarmut, pơtao Lakis păng pơtao pơlei Eglôn, akŭm đĭ-đăng lu linh sư tŏk năm hơdai wă năm blah Gibeôn"
"And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal, saying, “Do not forsake your servants; come up to us quickly, save us and help us, for all the kings of the Amorites who dwell in the mountains have gathered together against us.”","Kon pơlei bơngai Gibeôn wơh bơngai năm tơ Jôsuê lăm anih lu sư oei pơdơh tơ Gilgal: Apinh ih 'nĕ kơ achăng lê̆ đĭch đam ih, jah năm mă tĕnh bĕ dŏng pơklaih lu nhôn.

"So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.","Thoi noh Jôsuê hăm đĭ-đăng lu linh tơblah sư năm đơ̆ng Gilgal, lu linh noh nuih pran kơtang."
"And the LORD said to Joshua, “Do not fear them, for I have delivered them into your hand; not a man of them shall stand before you.”","Kră Yang khan kơ Jôsuê: 'Nĕ kơ hli kơ lu sư, yua kơ Inh jao ăn boih lu sư lăm tơpang ti ih, ưh kơ đei bu kĕ tơblah hăm ih ôh."
"Joshua therefore came upon them suddenly, having marched all night from Gilgal.","Jôsuê đơ̆ng Gilgal yak prăt măng truh tơblah pơm kơ lu ayăt kơdrăt."
"So the LORD routed them before Israel, killed them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, chased them along the road that goes to Beth Horon, and struck them down as far as Azekah and Makkedah.","Kră Yang pơm ăn kơ lu linh ayăt hli rŭng răng kơdâu tơklah tơklang 'bơ̆t anăp linh Isơrael, lu bơngai Isơrael tơblah ayăt jei jơnei tih jê̆ pơlei Gibeôn, lu linh Isơrael druh lu ayăt tŏk tơ trong suăn kơ pơlei Bêt Hôrôn, blah drŭt lu sư truh tơ pơlei Asêka păng pơlei Makkêđa."
"And it happened, as they fled before Israel and were on the descent of Beth Horon, that the LORD cast down large hailstones from heaven on them as far as Azekah, and they died. There were more who died from the hailstones than the children of Israel killed with the sword.","Kơplah lu linh ayăt kơdâu ôn kơ lu linh Isơrael, lu sư jur tơ krang đơ̆ng pơlei Bêt Hôrôn, truh tơ Asêka, Kră Yang ăn 'mi prĕl tih thoi tơmo đơ̆ng plĕnh, jur păng lu linh ayăt lôch kơ 'mi prĕl tih noh lơ hloh, kơ lu linh Isơrael pơlôch hăm đao gưm."
"Then Joshua spoke to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel: “Sun, stand still over Gibeon; And Moon, in the Valley of Aijalon.”","Lăm năr Kră Yang jao kon pơlei Amôrit lăm ti bơngai Isơrael, Jôsuê pơma dơnuh hăm Kră Yang 'bơ̆t anăp lu kon pơlei Isơrael: Ơ Măt 'năr, dơ̆ng bĕ 'bơ̆t pơlei Gibeôn; Ơ Măt khei, dơ̆ng bĕ 'bơ̆t Thŭng Aijalôn!"
"So the sun stood still, And the moon stopped, Till the people had revenge Upon their enemies. Is this not written in the Book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and did not hasten to go down for about a whole day.","Thoi noh Măt 'năr oei dơ̆ng minh 'bôt hăm măt khei dơ̆ng hloi, dĭng truh kơ kon pơlei Isơrael blah tơwih lu ayăt kơ lu sư, đang boih tơdrong noh đei chih lăm sơ̆p hla bơar Jashar. Măt 'năr oei dơ̆ng hloi tơ plĕnh, ưh kơ mơ̆t, lăm minh năr noh."
"And there has been no day like that, before it or after it, that the LORD heeded the voice of a man; for the LORD fought for Israel.","Đơ̆ng sơ̆ ưh tam biơh khơ̆ ning-mônh ưh kơ đei layơ thoi năr noh, 'noh jing năr Kră Yang mơ̆ng nơ̆r kon bơngai. Tơpă Kră Yang tơblah dŏng kon pơlei Isơrael."
"Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.","Jôsuê hăm lu linh Isơrael wih brŏk dơ̆ng tơ anih tơ Gilgal."
"But these five kings had fled and hidden themselves in a cave at Makkedah.","Pơđăm 'nu pơtao noh kơdâu ôn, lăm hơgơp tơmo tơ pơlei Makkêđa."
"And it was told Joshua, saying, “The five kings have been found hidden in the cave at Makkedah.”","Đei bơngai roi kơ Jôsuê: Đe đei 'bôh pơđăm 'nu pơtao ôn lăm hơgơp tơmo tơ Makkêđa."
"So Joshua said, “Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to guard them.","Jôsuê athei: Đe tơlơ̆ tơmo tih klơ̆p lê̆ 'măng hơgơp tơmo păng ăn hloi kơ bơngai răp 'bơ̆t 'măng tơmo noh."
"And do not stay there yourselves, but pursue your enemies, and attack their rear guard. Do not allow them to enter their cities, for the LORD your God has delivered them into your hand.”","Mă-lei lu iĕm 'nĕ kơ gô, druh blah lu linh ayăt, blah lu linh sư đơ̆ng gah rŏng, 'nĕ ăn kơ lu sư brŏk mơ̆t tơ pơlei lu sư, yua kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei iĕm jao ăn boih lu sư lăm tơpang ti lu iĕm."
"Then it happened, while Joshua and the children of Israel made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they had finished, that those who escaped entered fortified cities.","Thoi noh Jôsuê păng kon pơlei Isơrael blah pơlôch lơ tơpă mah wă goh, lu bơngai mă oei klaih, chă kơdâu ôn tơ lăm lu pơlei kơjăp."
"And all the people returned to the camp, to Joshua at Makkedah, in peace. No one moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.","Khŭl linh wih brŏk hơdai hăm Jôsuê hiôk-hian tơ lăm anih kơđông Makkêđa, ưh kơ đei bơngai bu pơ̆n wă pơma kơnê̆ kơ kon pơlei Isơrael dơ̆ng."
"Then Joshua said, “Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings to me from the cave.”","Jôsuê khan kơ lu sư: Pơih bĕ 'măng tơmo noh chông ba pơđăm 'nu pơtao noh năm tơ inh."
"And they did so, and brought out those five kings to him from the cave: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.","Thoi noh lu sư chông ba pơđăm 'nu pơtao noh lĕch đơ̆ng hơgơp tơmo, noh pơtao pơlei Jêrusalem, pơtao pơlei Hêbrôn, pơtao pơlei Jarmut, pơtao pơlei Lakis păng pơtao pơlei Eglôn."
"So it was, when they brought out those kings to Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the captains of the men of war who went with him, “Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings.” And they drew near and put their feet on their necks.","Lu sư chông ba pơđăm 'nu pơtao ei truh tơ Jôsuê, Jôsuê krao đĭ-đăng drŏ-nglo Isơrael khan hăm yŏng pơgơ̆r linh tơblah mă năm hơdai sư: Năm juă hơko lu pơtao âu, na lu sư năm juă hloi hơko lu pơtao noh."
"Then Joshua said to them, “Do not be afraid, nor be dismayed; be strong and of good courage, for thus the LORD will do to all your enemies against whom you fight.”","Jôsuê khan kơ lu sư, athei chơ̆n jơhngơ̆m nuih pran. 'Nâu boih Kră Yang wă pơm kơ đĭ-đăng bơngai ayăt kơ lu iĕm, mă lu iĕm wă blah."
"And afterward Joshua struck them and killed them, and hanged them on five trees; and they were hanging on the trees until evening.","Đơ̆ng noh Jôsuê pơlôch đĭ pơtao, athei đe hơtol kâu pơđăm 'nu pơtao noh tơ kơpal 'long, hơtol pơđăm 'nu pơtao noh truh kơsơ̆."
"So it was at the time of the going down of the sun that Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees, cast them into the cave where they had been hidden, and laid large stones against the cave’s mouth, which remain until this very day.","'Bơ̆t năr wă mơ̆t, Jôsuê athei đe tơjur akâu lu pơtao lôch đơ̆ng 'long na klơ̆m lê̆ lu sư tơ lăm hơgơp tơmo mă đêl lu sư ôn noh, iŏk tơmo tih klơ̆p lê̆ 'măng, truh tơ dang ei oei đei."
"On that day Joshua took Makkedah, and struck it and its king with the edge of the sword. He utterly destroyed them—all the people who were in it. He let none remain. He also did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.","Kơplah năr noh, Jôsuê đei blah iŏk pơlei Makkêđa, iŏk đao pơlôch pơtao, sư pơlôch đĭ lu bơngai lăm pơlei noh, ưh kơ đei bu oei arih, lu sư pơm kơ pơtao pơlei Makkêđa kư̆m thoi sư pơm kơ pơtao pơlei Jêrikô."
"Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah; and they fought against Libnah.","Jôsuê hăm đĭ-đăng lu linh Isơrael đơ̆ng pơlei Makkêđa năm tơblah hăm pơlei Lipna."
"And the LORD also delivered it and its king into the hand of Israel; he struck it and all the people who were in it with the edge of the sword. He let none remain in it, but did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.","Kră Yang, jao ăn pơlei Lipna păng pơtao sư lăm ti lu bơngai Isơrael; na Jôsuê iŏk đao gưm pơrăm pơlôch lu bơngai lăm pơlei noh, sư ưh kơ đei rong bu arih, sư pơm kơ pơtao pơlei Lipna kư̆m thoi sư pơm kơ pơtao pơlei Jêrikô."
"Then Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish; and they encamped against it and fought against it.","Jôsuê hăm lu bơngai Isơrael năm kiơ̆ sư đơ̆ng pơlei Lipna, năm tơ pơlei Lakis, pơm anih hăm kơđông linh wă blah hăm pơlei noh."
"And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, who took it on the second day, and struck it and all the people who were in it with the edge of the sword, according to all that he had done to Libnah.","Kră Yang jao pơlei Lakis lăm tơpang ti bơngai Isơrael, năr mă 'bar Jôsuê đei blah iŏk, yua đao gưm pơrăm păng pơlôch lu bơngai oei lăm pơlei noh kư̆m pơm lei-lăi thoi pơlei Lipna."
"Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua struck him and his people, until he left him none remaining.","Kơplah noh, Hôram pơtao pơlei Geser, tŏk blah wă dŏng pơlei Lakis, Jôsuê blah pơrăm đĭ, dĭng mah ưh pă đei bu oei arih."
"From Lachish Joshua passed to Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it and fought against it.","Jôsuê hăm kon pơlei Isơrael, weh đơ̆ng pơlei Lakis năm tơ pơlei Eglôn, lu sư pơm anih kơđông wă blah pơlei noh."
"They took it on that day and struck it with the edge of the sword; all the people who were in it he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.","Lăm năr noh mơ̆n lu sư blah iŏk pơlei, pơlôch pơrăm kon pơlei oei lăm pơlei noh hăm đao gưm, kư̆m thoi lu sư pơm kơ pơlei Lakis."
"So Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to Hebron; and they fought against it.","Đơ̆ng noh, Jôsuê hăm lu linh Isơrael đơ̆ng pơlei Eglôn tŏk năm tơ pơlei Hêbrôn wă năm blah pơlei noh"
"And they took it and struck it with the edge of the sword—its king, all its cities, and all the people who were in it; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon, but utterly destroyed it and all the people who were in it.","blah iŏk pơrăm pơlôch pơlei noh hăm đao gưm păng pơlôch pơtao, hăm lu pơlei jê̆ pơlôch đĭ-đăng kon pơlei kư̆m thoi pơrăm pơlei Eglôn ưh kơ đei bu gơh oei arih."
"Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and they fought against it.","Jôsuê hăm lu linh Isơrael, weh tơ pơlei Đêbir păng kư̆m blah iŏk pơlei noh."
"And he took it and its king and all its cities; they struck them with the edge of the sword and utterly destroyed all the people who were in it. He left none remaining; as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir and its king, as he had done also to Libnah and its king.","Lu sư blah iŏk pơlei noh păng lu pơlei jê̆, kư̆m rôp pơtao pơlôch hăm đao gưm păng pơlôch đĭ-đăng lu bơngai oei lăm pơlei noh ưh kơ đei lê̆ bu oei arih, sư pơm kơ kon pơlei Đêbir păng pơtao lu sư, kư̆m nhen thoi sư pơm kơ pơlei Hêbrôn pơlei Lipna hăm pơtao sư."
"So Joshua conquered all the land: the mountain country and the South and the lowland and the wilderness slopes, and all their kings; he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded.","Thoi noh Jôsuê blah iŏk đĭ pơlei đĭ tơring char, tơ gah tơring groi kông, tơring gah gơal, tơring gah groi bơmơ̆t.

"Joshua turned back at that time and took Hazor, and struck its king with the sword; for Hazor was formerly the head of all those kingdoms.","Đơ̆ng noh Jôsuê wih brŏk, blah iŏk pơlei Hasor păng pơlôch pơtao lu sư hăm đao gưm, Yua kơ sơ̆ pơlei Hasor tih jing kơ̆l lăm char ei."

"For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that He might utterly destroy them, and that they might receive no mercy, but that He might destroy them, as the LORD had commanded Moses.","Yua kơ Kră Yang ăn lăm jơhngơ̆m lu pơtao arăng kơ̆l 'maih wă tơblah hăm lu bơngai Isơrael, wă kơ lu sư jing hiong răm đĭ, ưh pă đei bu mơnat, kiơ̆ thoi Kră Yang đei tơtă pơkă boih kơ Môis."
"And at that time Joshua came and cut off the Anakim from the mountains: from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel; Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.","Kơplah noh Jôsuê năm blah kon pơlei Anakim, oei tơ kơpal groi kông, tơ pơlei Hêbrôn, Đêbir, Anap, đơ̆ng jơ̆p kơpal kông groi Juđa, hăm kông groi Isơrael, Jôsuê blah pơlôch pơrăm lu sư, hăm lu pơlei tih lu sư hloi."

"So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD had said to Moses; and Joshua gave it as an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. Then the land rested from war.","Jôsuê blah iŏk đĭ-đăng tơring char 'nâu, kiơ̆ tôm tơdrong thoi Kră Yang khan pơkă kơ Môis păng Jôsuê asong ăn teh kơ lu bơngai Isơrael jang sa mir 'ba păng klah asong kiơ̆ rim kơ khŭl adrĕch adrung lu sư.

"As yet I am as strong this day as on the day that Moses sent me; just as my strength was then, so now is my strength for war, both for going out and for coming in.","Inh kư̆m oei đei jơhngơ̆m pran thoi kơplah Môis wơh inh năm sơ̆, inh oei đei jơhngơ̆m pran năm tơblah, thoi kơplah noh sơ̆"
"Now therefore, give me this mountain of which the LORD spoke in that day; for you heard in that day how the Anakim were there, and that the cities were great and fortified. It may be that the LORD will be with me, and I shall be able to drive them out as the LORD said.”","Hrei âu ăn bĕ kơ inh teh kông groi âu, mă Kră Yang pơkă boih wă ăn kơ inh lăm năr noh sơ̆, ih kư̆m kơtơ̆ng băt boih năr noh sơ̆ đei kon pơlei Anakim oei tơ noh păng đei pơlei tih să kơjăp, mă-lei đei Kră Yang tơgŭm inh, na inh gô pơpuh lu sư, kiơ̆ thoi Kră Yang khan boih."
"And Joshua blessed him, and gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as an inheritance.","Jôsuê hơpơi ăn hloi pŭn hiôk kơ Kalep, kon drŏ-nglo Jêphunê ăn teh Hêbrôn kơ Kalep, jang sa."
"Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he wholly followed the LORD God of Israel.","Thoi noh na Hêbrôn jing teh ăn kơ Kalep jang sa kon drŏ-nglo Jêphunê, đơ̆ng bơngai Kênisit ăn kơ Kalep jang sa mă truh dang ei, yua kơ sư chu păng pơm kiơ̆ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael đĭ jơhngơ̆m."
"And the name of Hebron formerly was Kirjath Arba (Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim). Then the land had rest from war.","Sơ̆ Hêbrôn đe krao Kiriat Arba, Arba bơngai nuih pran tih kơjung lăm kon pơlei Anakim. Đơ̆ng noh, char đei hiôk-hian ưh pă đei tơdrong tơblah dơ̆ng."
"So this was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families: The border of Edom at the Wilderness of Zin southward was the extreme southern boundary.","Teh hlang lăng trŏ kơ adrĕch Juđa, kiơ̆ kơ adrĕch adrung lu sư, să truh tơ char Eđôm lăm char glă Yin tôch tơ gah gơal."
"And their southern border began at the shore of the Salt Sea, from the bay that faces southward.","Hơdral gah gơal iŏk đơ̆ng rong đak dơsĭ tơ gah gơal tôch kơ Dơsĭ 'Boh."
"Then it went out to the southern side of the Ascent of Akrabbim, passed along to Zin, ascended on the south side of Kadesh Barnea, passed along to Hezron, went up to Adar, and went around to Karkaa.","Hlôi tơ gah gơal kơ kuĕl Hơguăt tơpăt rok char glă Yin, tŏk dăr tơ gah gơal kơ Kades Barnêa, brih kơ Hêsrôn, tơklă Ađar, dăr truh tơklă Karka"
"From there it passed toward Azmon and went out to the Brook of Egypt; and the border ended at the sea. This shall be your southern border.","Rok kiơ̆ Asmôn, jur truh đak glung Êyiptơ, lĕch tôch tơ jih đak dơsĭ. 'Nâu jing hơdral gah gơal."
"The east border was the Salt Sea as far as the mouth of the Jordan. And the border on the northern quarter began at the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan.","Hơdral gah hơlĕch noh đơ̆ng đak Dơsĭ 'Boh truh tơ tu đak Krong Jôrđăn.

"The border went up to Beth Hoglah and passed north of Beth Arabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben.","tŏk tơ Bêt Hôgla, tơ gah yă-nơ̆m pơlei Bêt Araba, truh tơ Tơmo Bôhan, (anăn kon drŏ-nglo Rubên)"
"Then the border went up toward Debir from the Valley of Achor, and it turned northward toward Gilgal, which is before the Ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the valley. The border continued toward the waters of En Shemesh and ended at En Rogel.","đơ̆ng âu hơdral tŏk tơ Đêbir, đơ̆ng thŭng Akôr năm tơpăt tơ gah yă-nơ̆m dăr tơklă Gilgal, tơklă kuĕl Ađumim gah gơal kơ thŭng rok cheng tu đak Ên Sêmes păng tơtil tu đak Ên Rôgel."
"And the border went up by the Valley of the Son of Hinnom to the southern slope of the Jebusite city (which is Jerusalem). The border went up to the top of the mountain that lies before the Valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the Valley of Rephaim northward.","Đơ̆ng noh rok tŏk tơ thŭng Ben Hinôm, tơtil gah gơal kơ pơlei bơngai Jêbus noh Jêrusalem đơ̆ng noh tŏk rok truh kơpal kông jê̆ thŭng Hinôm gah bơmơ̆t, gah yă-nơ̆m tôch tơ thŭng Rêphaim."
"Then the border went around from the top of the hill to the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and extended to the cities of Mount Ephron. And the border went around to Baalah (which is Kirjath Jearim).","Hơdral 'nâu đơ̆ng luĕl kông truh tơ đak glung Neptôa tơtil lu pơlei kơpal kông Êphrôn, jur tơ Baala, noh Kiriat Jêrim."
"Then the border turned westward from Baalah to Mount Seir, passed along to the side of Mount Jearim on the north (which is Chesalon), went down to Beth Shemesh, and passed on to Timnah.","Hơdral đơ̆ng Baala dăr tơ gah bơmơ̆t truh tơ Kông Sêir, 'moi rok gah yă-nơ̆m kơ Kông Jêarim, noh Kêsalôn; pơtrơp jur rok tơpăt truh tơ Bêt Sêmes hlôi kơ Thimna."
"And the border went out to the side of Ekron northward. Then the border went around to Shicron, passed along to Mount Baalah, and extended to Jabneel; and the border ended at the sea.","Hơdral sư kiơ̆ rok tơter kông gah yă-nơ̆m kơ Ekrôn, rok dăr truh tơ gah Sikêrôn, 'moi rok Kông Baala, truh tơ Japnêl, tôch tơ đak dơsĭ."
"The west border was the coastline of the Great Sea. This is the boundary of the children of Judah all around according to their families.","Hơdral gah bơmơ̆t, noh rok tơter đak Dơsĭ Tih, noh boih hơdral tăp dăr puăn pah lu bơngai Juđa, kiơ̆ kơ adrĕch adrung lu sư."
"Now to Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a share among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, namely, Kirjath Arba, which is Hebron (Arba was the father of Anak).","Jôsuê ăn kơ Kalep, kon drŏ-nglo Jêphunê, minh pah teh đơ̆ng lăm lu bơngai Juđa, kiơ̆ thoi Kră Yang khan kơ Jôsuê; Kiriat Arba.

"Caleb drove out the three sons of Anak from there: Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.","Đơ̆ng pơlei Hêbrôn Kalep puh tơweh pêng adrĕch Anak noh adrĕch Sêsai, Ahiman păng Thalmai noh adrĕch adrung Anak ngăl."
"Then he went up from there to the inhabitants of Debir (formerly the name of Debir was Kirjath Sepher).","Đơ̆ng noh lu sư năm blah kon pơlei tih Đêbir, noh sơ̆ đe anăn pơlei Kiriat Sêpher."
"And Caleb said, “He who attacks Kirjath Sepher and takes it, to him I will give Achsah my daughter as wife.”","Kalep khan: Inh gô ăn kon drŏ-kăn inh Aksa, pơm akăn bơngai bu kĕ blah iŏk đei pơlei Kiriat Sêpher."
"So Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it; and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.","Ôtniêl, kon drŏ-nglo Kêna oh Kalep đei blah iŏk pơlei noh; na Kalep ăn hloi Aksa kon drŏ-kăn sư pơm akăn Ôtniêl."
"Now it was so, when she came to him, that she persuaded him to ask her father for a field. So she dismounted from her donkey, and Caleb said to her, “What do you wish?”","Aksa oei tơ hnam Ôtniêl, sư athei klo sư apinh 'bă sư mir chŭn, Aksa 'nao jur đơ̆ng aseh sư, Kalep jet, kon wă kơ kiơ?"
"She answered, “Give me a blessing; since you have given me land in the South, give me also springs of water.” So he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.","Aksa tơl, apinh 'bă ăn tơmam pŭn hiôk kơ kon, yua kơ 'bă ăn boih kơ kon teh oei lăm tơring glă gah gơal, na apinh ăn hloi kơ kon teh đei tu đak na Kalep ăn kơ kon sư 'bar 'bôt tu đak tơ gah kơpơ̆ng hăm tơ gah ala."

"There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh, for he was the firstborn of Joseph: namely for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of war; therefore he was given Gilead and Bashan.","'Nâu teh asong ăn kơ adrĕch Manase, sư jing kon kơdră Jôsep, teh kơ Makir, kon kơdră Manase păng Makir 'bă kơ Gileat, yua kơ lu sư jing linh tơblah nuih, noh na sư gơh đei char Gileat păng Basan."
"And there was a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh according to their families: for the children of Abiezer, the children of Helek, the children of Asriel, the children of Shechem, the children of Hepher, and the children of Shemida; these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families.","Đe kư̆m đei klah asong adrĕch Manase, kiơ̆ kơ adrĕch adrung lu sư; lu kon sâu Abiêse, kon sâu Hêlek, kon sâu Asriel, kon sâu Sichem, kon sâu Hêpher, kon sâu Sêmiđa.

"But Zelophehad the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but only daughters.

"And they came near before Eleazar the priest, before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the rulers, saying, “The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers.” Therefore, according to the commandment of the LORD, he gave them an inheritance among their father’s brothers.","Lu kon drŏ-kăn âu dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp 'bok soi Êlêasar, 'bơ̆t anăp Jôsuê, kon drŏ-nglo Nun păng 'bơ̆t anăp lu kră pơgơ̆r pơlei, na khan: Kră Yang khan kơ Môis asong ăn kơ lu nhôn đei teh jang sa lăm lu 'nhŏng oh lu nhôn.

"And the territory of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, that lies east of Shechem; and the border went along south to the inhabitants of En Tappuah.","Teh jang sa lu adrĕch Manase iŏk đơ̆ng teh đak Aser truh tơ Mitmêtat gah hơlĕch kơ pơlei Sichem, đơ̆ng noh hơdral sư rok thŭng truh tơ lu kon pơlei oei 'bơ̆t pơlei Ên Tapua."

"And the border descended to the Brook Kanah, southward to the brook. These cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh. The border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook; and it ended at the sea.","Đơ̆ng noh hơdral lu sư rok iŏk đơ̆ng gơal kơ Chơkơi đak Kana Rawen; lu pơlei tih noh gah lu bơngai Êphraim oei tŏk-bŏk lăm pơlei tih Manase; mă-lei hơdral Manase rok tơ yă-nơ̆m kơ chơkơi đak păng tôch tơ đak dơsĭ."

"And in Issachar and in Asher, Manasseh had Beth Shean and its towns, Ibleam and its towns, the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, the inhabitants of En Dor and its towns, the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns—three hilly regions.","Teh gah Isakar păng Aser kư̆m đei adrĕch Manase oei thoi pơlei Bêt Sêan.

"So Joshua answered them, “If you are a great people, then go up to the forest country and clear a place for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and the giants, since the mountains of Ephraim are too confined for you.”","Jôsuê tơl lu sư: “Tơdah kon pơlei lu iĕm lơ kơdrâ̆m lei lu iĕm năm muih jang tơ bri kơdrơ̆ng tơ kông to, tơ anih noh iĕm choh iŏk jang sa lăm teh char bơngai Phêrêsit păng lu kon pơlei Raphait.

"But the children of Joseph said, “The mountain country is not enough for us; and all the Canaanites who dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both those who are of Beth Shean and its towns and those who are of the Valley of Jezreel.”","Lu kon sâu Jôsep tơl khan: Tơ kông ưh kơmah kơ lu nhôn ôh; bĕ tơ lăm thŭng dơnă, đĭ-đăng kon pơlei Kanaan oei tơ noh, đei gre aseh mam păng lu kon pơlei Bêt Sêan hai, hăm lu pơlei, lu sư oei kư̆m thoi kon pơlei lăm thŭng Jêsreel."
"And Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph—to Ephraim and Manasseh—saying, “You are a great people and have great power; you shall not have only one lot","Kơplah noh Jôsuê khan kơ adrĕch Jôsep, lu adrĕch adrung Êphraim păng lu adrĕch Manase, khan: Lu iĕm jing kon pơlei kơdrơ̆m lơ păng đei jơhngơ̆m pran kơtang, ưh kơ sĭ iŏk teh lăp minh đĕch ôh"
"but the mountain country shall be yours. Although it is wooded, you shall cut it down, and its farthest extent shall be yours; for you shall drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots and are strong.”","mă-lei char gah kông noh jing teh lu iĕm mă khan bri kơdrơ̆ng, lu iĕm chong muih jang truh tơ jơ̆p-jang mă să ataih, yua kơ lu iĕm gơh puh tơweh lu kon pơlei Kanaan, mă khan lu sư đei gre aseh mam pran kơtang ră."
"Now the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of meeting there. And the land was subdued before them.","Đĭ-đăng kon pơlei Isơrael, đei akŭm tơ pơlei Silô, pơm pơdơ̆ng Bơsŭn anih akŭm blŭng-a tơ noh: Lu sư pơgơ̆r jơ̆p teh đak."
"But there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes which had not yet received their inheritance.","Mă-lei oei đei pă tơpơh adrĕch Isơrael tam mă đei asong teh jang sa."
"Then Joshua said to the children of Israel: “How long will you neglect to go and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers has given you?","Na, Jôsuê khan hăm kon pơlei Isơrael: Iĕm wă gô dang yơ dơ̆ng năm mơ̆t blah iŏk char mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei 'bok lu iĕm ăn bơih kơ iĕm?"
"Pick out from among you three men for each tribe, and I will send them; they shall rise and go through the land, survey it according to their inheritance, and come back to me.","Rơih lăm rim adrĕch pêng 'nu, inh wă wơh ăn kơ lu sư năm, lu sư âu gô năm lăng tơ jơ̆p kơ char, chih roi tơbăt teh gah yơ kơ adrĕch lu sư kơdih, đang boih na brŏk wih tơ inh."
"And they shall divide it into seven parts. Judah shall remain in their territory on the south, and the house of Joseph shall remain in their territory on the north.","Lu iĕm athei klah asong char noh kơ tơpơh adrĕch adrung; Juđa athei oei tơ gah gơal, adrĕch Jôsep oei tơ gah yă-nơ̆m."
"You shall therefore survey the land in seven parts and bring the survey here to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God.","Đang kơ lu iĕm chih roi kơ teh asong lăm tơpơh adrĕch noh, na ba hla bơar noh tơ inh; inh gô hlang lăng ăn kơ lu iĕm tơ âu 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu bơ̆n."
"But the Levites have no part among you, for the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance. And Gad, Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.”","Mă-lei bơngai Lêwi ưh kơ đei asong ôh teh wă jang sa dơ̆ng lăm lu iĕm, yua kơ lu sư jing 'bok soi jang kơ Kră Yang noh jing tơdrong jang sa lu sư.

"Then the men arose to go away; and Joshua charged those who went to survey the land, saying, “Go, walk through the land, survey it, and come back to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD in Shiloh.”","Kơplah lu sư iung yak năm; Jôsuê pơkă kơ lu sư.

"So the men went, passed through the land, and wrote the survey in a book in seven parts by cities; and they came to Joshua at the camp in Shiloh.","Thoi noh lu sư năm jơ̆p kơ char, chhơ̆ rup teh đak lăm sơ̆p hla bơar hơkar ră roi kơ rim pơlei lăm char noh mă asong kơ tơpơh adrĕch, na lu sư wih brŏk tơ Jôsuê oei lăm anih tơ pơlei Silô."
"Then Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD, and there Joshua divided the land to the children of Israel according to their divisions.","Jôsuê hlang lăng kơ lu sư tơ pơlei Silô, 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang; tơ noh Jôsuê klah asong char ăn kơ kon pơlei Isơrael, kiơ̆ kơ adrĕch adrung lu sư."
"Now the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families, and the territory of their lot came out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.","Hlang lăng iŏk trŏ kơ adrĕch Bênjamin, kiơ̆ kơ adrĕch adrung lu sư, teh mă klah asong lu sư, oei tŏk-bŏk sơlam lu adrĕch Juđa păng Jôsep."

"Now to half the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given a possession in Bashan, but to the other half of it Joshua gave a possession among their brethren on this side of the Jordan, westward.

"So the children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the country of Gilead, to the land of their possession, which they had obtained according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.","Thoi noh lu bơngai Rubên, bơngai Gat păng minh puăt kơ adrĕch Manase weh đơ̆ng kon pơlei Isơrael tơ Silô lăm char Kanaan, wih brŏk tơ char Gileat teh jang sa mir 'ba kơdih, mă lu sư đei blah iŏk boih kiơ̆ kơ nơ̆r Kră Yang pơkă ăn kơ Môis."

"Nevertheless, if the land of your possession is unclean, then cross over to the land of the possession of the LORD, where the LORD’s tabernacle stands, and take possession among us; but do not rebel against the LORD, nor rebel against us, by building yourselves an altar besides the altar of the LORD our God.","Tơdah teh lu iĕm iŏk kơnê̆ ưh kơ 'lơ̆ng, năm bĕ tơ teh Kră Yang đei pơkă ăn, pơm bơsŭn anih akŭm Kră Yang, na chĕng iŏk teh noh oei păng 'nĕ pơjing chơnang soi kơdih ayăt kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu bơ̆n."

"Therefore we said that it will be, when they say this to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say, ‘Here is the replica of the altar of the LORD which our fathers made, though not for burnt offerings nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between you and us.’","Păng lu nhôn đei khan: Dah layơ lu sư khan kơ lu bơ̆n, dah kơ adrĕch lu bơ̆n, thoi noh lu bơ̆n gô tơl: Lu iĕm lăng rup chơnang soi âu trŏ chơnang soi Kră Yang, mă 'bok lu bơ̆n đei pơm sơ̆, chơnang soi 'nâu ưh kơ trŏ wă pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'buh dah pơyơ̆r tơmam soi nai, mă-lei pơm tơdra tơbăt tŏk-bŏk lu nhôn păng lu iĕm!"

"Now when Phinehas the priest and the rulers of the congregation, the heads of the divisions of Israel who were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and the children of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them.","Kơplah 'bok soi Phinêhas păng lu kră pơgơ̆r lăm khŭl tơpôl, wă khan lu kră Yŏng kơdră kon pơlei bơngai Isơrael mơ̆ng nơ̆r bơngai Rubên, bơngai Gat păng minh puăt bơngai Manase pơma lu sư lăp đon."
"Then Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and the children of Manasseh, “This day we perceive that the LORD is among us, because you have not committed this treachery against the LORD.

"And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the rulers, returned from the children of Reuben and the children of Gad, from the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought back word to them.","Phinêhas, kon drŏ-nglo 'bok soi Êlêasar, hăm lu kră pơgơ̆r kon pơlei tơklah đơ̆ng bơngai Rubên, bơngai Gat tơ char Gileat, wih brŏk tơ Kanaan; păng roi kơ kon pơlei Isơrael tơdrong noh."
"So the thing pleased the children of Israel, and the children of Israel blessed God; they spoke no more of going against them in battle, to destroy the land where the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt.","Lu kon pơlei Isơrael hiôk kơtơ̆ng tơdrong âu lu sư bơnê kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei, lu sư ưh pă pơma 'bơm kơ tơblah hăm pơrăm lu bơngai Rubên păng bơngai Gat, dơ̆ng."

"When you have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God, which He commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed down to them, then the anger of the LORD will burn against you, and you shall perish quickly from the good land which He has given you.”","Tơdah lu iĕm sơngah kơ tơdrong pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu iĕm, đei hlôi bơtho pơkă, na lu iĕm achăng lê̆ Kră Yang, chă bơ̆jang awih awăn păng drap kơkuh kơ lu yang nai, lei tơdrong Kră Yang hil mĭl tih gô truh tơ lu iĕm, na lu iĕm gô lôch hiong răm đĭ đơ̆ng char 'lơ̆ng rŏ mă Kră Yang đei ăn boih."
"Then Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem and called for the elders of Israel, for their heads, for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God.","Jôsuê krao akŭm đĭ adrĕch adrung Isơrael tơ Sichem.

"And Joshua said to all the people, “Thus says the LORD God of Israel: ‘Your fathers, including Terah, the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor, dwelt on the other side of the River in old times; and they served other gods.","Jôsuê khan hăm đĭ-đăng kon pơlei: “Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael đei khan: ‘'Bok iĕm sơ̆ noh Tharê 'bă kơ Abraham păng Nakô, oei gah to Krong Tih păng bơ̆jang kơkuh kơ lu yang nai."
"Then I took your father Abraham from the other side of the River, led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his descendants and gave him Isaac.","Mă-lei inh rơih iŏk Abraham 'bok lu iĕm lĕch đơ̆ng gah to Krong Tih păng chông ba sư năm jơ̆p-jang kơ dêh Kanaan, ăn kơ sư Isăk păng ăn kơ adrĕch adrung sư chek lar lơ."
"To Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. To Esau I gave the mountains of Seir to possess, but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt.","Inh ăn Jakôp păng Êsâu kơ Isăk, ăn kông Sêir kơ Êsâu bơ̆jang sa mir 'ba, gah Jakôp hăm lu kon sư jur oei tơ char Êyiptơ."
"Also I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to what I did among them. Afterward I brought you out.","Đơ̆ng noh, Inh wơh Môis hăm Arôn yua tơdrong mơsêh wă pơrăm tơ lăm char Êyiptơ; na Inh 'ba lu iĕm lĕch đơ̆ng noh."

"So they cried out to the LORD; and He put darkness between you and the Egyptians, brought the sea upon them, and covered them. And your eyes saw what I did in Egypt. Then you dwelt in the wilderness a long time.","Mă-lei, 'bok yă lu iĕm krao apinh Kră Yang dŏng, Kră Yang ăn đei măng mu lăm lu kon pơlei Êyiptơ hăm lu iĕm, Kră Yang ăn đak dơsĭ lơ̆p bơngai Êyiptơ păng măt lu iĕm 'bôh boih Inh pơm kơ lu bơngai Êyiptơ.

"And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, who dwelt on the other side of the Jordan, and they fought with you.

"Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose to make war against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you.","Kơplah Balak kon drŏ-nglo Sêpbô pơtao Môap iung tơblah hăm kon pơlei Isơrael, wơh Balaam, kon drŏ-nglo Bêôr, wă kơ hiap lu iĕm."

"Then you went over the Jordan and came to Jericho. And the men of Jericho fought against you—also the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. But I delivered them into your hand.","Na lu iĕm tŏk kơ đak Krong Jôrđăn truh tơ pơlei Jêrikô, lu kon pơlei bơngai Jêrikô wă blah lu iĕm kư̆m thoi kon pơlei Amôrit, kon pơlei Pêrêsit kon pơlei Kanaan, kon pơlei Hêtit, kon pơlei Girgasit, kon pơlei Hêwit păng kon pơlei Jêbus, mă-lei Inh jao lu sư lăm tơpang ti lu iĕm."
"I sent the hornet before you which drove them out from before you, also the two kings of the Amorites, but not with your sword or with your bow.","Inh wơh lu ong druh lu sư 'bơ̆t anăp lu iĕm, thoi druh 'bar 'nu pơtao kon pơlei Amôrit, thoi noh lu iĕm ưh pă kăl yua đao gưm hră đơ̆ng."
"I have given you a land for which you did not labor, and cities which you did not build, and you dwell in them; you eat of the vineyards and olive groves which you did not plant.’","Inh ăn kơ lu iĕm teh đak mă lu iĕm ưh kơ ngĕ choh gleh hrat păng pơlei tih lu iĕm ưh kơ ngĕ kơ man pơjing păng lu iĕm iŏk oei tơ noh đĕch; lu pơgar hơmu hăm plei 'long ôliwơ lu iĕm yua pơm tơmam sa, lu iĕm kư̆m ưh kơ đei pơtăm.’"
"“Now therefore, fear the LORD, serve Him in sincerity and in truth, and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the River and in Egypt.

"And if it seems evil to you to serve the LORD, choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell. But as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.”","Tơdah lu iĕm ưh kơ wă chu yom ôh kơ Kră Yang, lei dang ei athei rơih iŏk bĕ kơdih lu iĕm wă kơkuh kơ bu, kơ lu yang mă lu 'bok yă lu iĕm kơkuh tơ gah hơlĕch kơ đak Krong Tih dah lu yang kon pơlei Amôrit lăm char lu sư; mă lu iĕm oei âu Mă-lei gah inh păng hnam inh gô chu yom păng pơm kiơ̆ kơ Kră Yang.”"

"But Joshua said to the people, “You cannot serve the LORD, for He is a holy God.

"And the people said to Joshua, “No, but we will serve the LORD!”","Mă-lei kon pơlei oei khan kơ Jôsuê: Ưh ôh, lu nhôn gô chu yom kơ Kră Yang."
"So Joshua said to the people, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the LORD for yourselves, to serve Him.” And they said, “We are witnesses!”","Kơplah noh, Jôsuê khan hăm kon pơlei: Lu iĕm pơm kơdranh kơdih lu iĕm khan lu iĕm hlôi rơih iŏk boih Kră Yang wă chu yom kơ Sư.

"“Now therefore,” he said, “put away the foreign gods which are among you, and incline your heart to the LORD God of Israel.”","Jôsuê khan dơ̆ng: Thoi noh, dang ei, athei hŭt lê̆ bĕ yang tơmoi đơ̆ng lăm lu iĕm, athei đei jơhngơ̆m chu brŏk tơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael."

"So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and made for them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.","Lăm năr noh Jôsuê tơ'blŏk ăn tơdrong pơgơ̆p kơ kon pơlei păng tơbăt ăn kơ lu sư khôi juăt păng nơ̆r tơtă tơ pơlei Sichem."
"Then Joshua wrote these words in the Book of the Law of God.

"And Joshua said to all the people, “Behold, this stone shall be a witness to us, for it has heard all the words of the LORD which He spoke to us.

"So Joshua let the people depart, each to his own inheritance.","Jôsuê ăn kơ kon pơlei wih, bu bu kư̆m wih brŏk jang sa mir 'ba kơdih."
"Now it came to pass after these things that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being one hundred and ten years old.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ lu tơdrong noh, Jôsuê kon drŏ-nglo Nun, đĭch đam Kră Yang, lôch, sư arih đei minh-hrĕng mơjĭt sơnăm."

"The bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel had brought up out of Egypt, they buried at Shechem, in the plot of ground which Jacob had bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for one hundred pieces of silver, and which had become an inheritance of the children of Joseph.","Kơting Jôsep mă kon pơlei Isơrael iŏk chĕp ba đơ̆ng char Êyiptơ, 'bŭ tơ pơlei Sichem, lăm teh mă Jakôp răt đơ̆ng kon drŏ-nglo Hamôr, 'bă kơ Pơlei Sichem, minh-hrĕng tơpei jên hu;a kon sâu Jôsep đei teh noh jing teh jang sa mir 'ba lu sư."
