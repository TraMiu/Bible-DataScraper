"Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, “Who shall be first to go up for us against the Canaanites to fight against them?”","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ Jôsuê lôch, kon pơlei Isơrael krao apinh Kră Yang khan: Bơngai bu lăm lu nhôn athei năm blah păng kon pơlei Kanaan adrol?"
"And the LORD said, “Judah shall go up. Indeed I have delivered the land into his hand.”","Kră Yang tơl: Lu bơngai Juđa iĕm boih athei năm adrol; to Inh pơjao boih, dêh char lăm ti lu sư."
"So Judah said to Simeon his brother, “Come up with me to my allotted territory, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I will likewise go with you to your allotted territory.” And Simeon went with him.","Bơngai Juđa pơma dơnuh hăm bơngai Simêôn, 'nhŏng oh lu sư, sư khan: Bĕ bơ̆n năm hơdai nhôn tơ teh đei hlang lăng trŏ kơ nhôn boih, na lu bơ̆n gô blah kon pơlei Kanaan; đơ̆ng noh nhôn gô năm hơdai lu 'nhŏng oh truh tơ dêh char mă đei hlang lăng boih trŏ kơ 'nhŏng oh. Bơngai Simêôn năm hơdai hăm lu sư."
"Then Judah went up, and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand; and they killed ten thousand men at Bezek.","Thoi noh lu bơngai Juđa năm, Kră Yang jao kon pơlei Kanaan păng kon pơlei Phêrêsit lăm ti lu sư; tơ Bêsek sư blah pơlôch mơjĭt-rơbâu 'nu bơngai."
"And they found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek, and fought against him; and they defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites.","Tơ Bêsek kư̆m đei tơ'bơ̆p Ađôni Bêsek, na blah lu sư, păng kon pơlei Kanaan păng kon pơlei Phêrsit."
"Then Adoni-Bezek fled, and they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and big toes.","Ađôni Bêsek kơdâu ôn mă-lei lu sư druh 'moi đei rôp sư chơ̆ng lê̆ hơnglâu yŏng ti păng hơnglâu yŏng jơ̆ng sư."
"And Adoni-Bezek said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off used to gather scraps under my table; as I have done, so God has repaid me.” Then they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.","Kơplah noh Ađôni Bêsek khan: Sơ̆ đei tơpơh-jĭt 'nu pơtao đe chơ̆ng hơnglâu yŏng ti păng hơnglâu Yŏng jơ̆ng boih, lu sư chă dônh sa tơmam sa huŏng ala kơ 'bang inh. Tơdrong mă đêl inh pơm Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei pơm tơwih kơ inh. Lu sư chông ba sư truh tơ pơlei Jêrusalem păng sư lôch tơ noh."
"Now the children of Judah fought against Jerusalem and took it; they struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire.","Bơngai Juđa blah iŏk pơlei Jêrusalem; lu sư yua đao pơlôch kon pơlei păng klơ̆m ŭnh soh pơlei."
"And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who dwelt in the mountains, in the South, and in the lowland.","Đơ̆ng noh lu bơngai Juđa jur năm blah kon pơlei Kanaan mă oei tơ kơpal groi kông, tơ gah gơal păng tơ anih dơhnă"
"Then Judah went against the Canaanites who dwelt in Hebron. (Now the name of Hebron was formerly Kirjath Arba.) And they killed Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.","Đơ̆ng noh lu sư blah kon pơlei Kanaan oei tơ Hêbrôna păng blah Sêsai, Ahiman, hăm Tanmai."
"From there they went against the inhabitants of Debir. (The name of Debir was formerly Kirjath Sepher.)","Đơ̆ng noh bơngai Juđa năm blah kon pơlei oei tơ pơlei Đêbir.b"
"Then Caleb said, “Whoever attacks Kirjath Sepher and takes it, to him I will give my daughter Achsah as wife.”","Kalep khan: Bu năm blah iŏk đei Kirat Sêpher, na gô ăn sư oei kơ kon adruh inh Aksa."
"And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it; so he gave him his daughter Achsah as wife.","Kơplah noh, Ôtniêl kon tơdăm Kêna, oh Kalep blah iŏk pơlei noh na Kalep iŏk kon adruh sư anăn Aksa pơm akăn Ôtniêl."
"Now it happened, when she came to him, that she urged him to ask her father for a field. And she dismounted from her donkey, and Caleb said to her, “What do you wish?”","Wă sư brŏk tơ Ôtniêl boih sư athei klo sư apinh đơ̆ng 'bă sư minh hlak chŭn đei tu đak. Adruh ei 'nao jur đơ̆ng aseh na Kalep jet: Kon wă kơ kiơ?"
"So she said to him, “Give me a blessing; since you have given me land in the South, give me also springs of water.” And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.","Kon sư tơl: Apinh ih ăn kơ inh tơdrong pŭn hiôk. Yua kơ 'Bă ăn boih teh gah gơal, ưh kơ đei đak, apinh ih kư̆m ăn dơ̆ng kơ inh teh đei tu đak. Na Kalep ăn kơ kon sư teh đei 'bar 'bôt tu đak tơ gah kơpơ̆ng păng tơ gah ala."
"Now the children of the Kenite, Moses’ father-in-law, went up from the City of Palms with the children of Judah into the Wilderness of Judah, which lies in the South near Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.","Bơngai Kênit 'noh kon sâu tơnei 'bok Môis đơ̆ng pơlei 'Long gol năm tŏk hăm kon sâu Juđa, truh tơ anih glă char Juđa, tơ gah gơal Arat păng pơm anih oei tŏk-bŏk kon pơlei pơla."
"And Judah went with his brother Simeon, and they attacked the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. So the name of the city was called Hormah.","Kơplah ei, lu bơngai Juđa năm hơdai hăm 'nhŏng oh sư kơdih, bơngai Simêôn, mă blah kon pơlei Kanaan oei tơ pơlei Sêphat, pơrăm đĭ pơlei ei; đơ̆ng noh đe krao anăn pơlei noh Horma."
"Also Judah took Gaza with its territory, Ashkelon with its territory, and Ekron with its territory.","Bơngai Juđa kư̆m blah iŏk pơlei Gasa hăm anih teh mă sư pơgơ̆r pơlei Askalon hăm anih teh mă sư pơgơ̆r păng pơlei Ekrôn hăm anih teh mă sư pơgơ̆r."
"So the LORD was with Judah. And they drove out the mountaineers, but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the lowland, because they had chariots of iron.","Kră Yang oei hơdai hăm bơngai Juđê na bơngai Juđê gơh iŏk oei tơ lu pơlei kơpal groi kông, mă-lei lu kon pơlei oei tơ lăm thŭng lu sư ưh kơ gơh pơpuh ôh, yua kơ lu đe ei đei gre aseh pơm păng bơsei."
"And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had said. Then he expelled from there the three sons of Anak.","Kiơ̆ kơ Môis athei, lu sư jao pơlei Hêbrôn ăn kơ Kalep. Kalep pơpuh tơweh pêng 'nu kon drŏ-nglo Anak lĕch đơ̆ng pơlei ei."
"But the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem; so the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.","Mă-lei kon sâu Bênjamin ưh kơ gơh puh lê̆ kon pơlei Jêbus đơ̆ng pơlei Jêrusalem, na kon pơlei Jêbus oei oei hơdai kon sâu Bênjamin dĭng truh tơ dang ei."
"And the house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and the LORD was with them.","Na adrĕch adrung Jôsep kư̆m tŏk blah pơlei Bethel păng Kră Yang oei hơdai lu sư."
"So the house of Joseph sent men to spy out Bethel. (The name of the city was formerly Luz.)","Lu sư wơh bơngai năm chop lăng adrol kơ năm blah tơ Bethel;c anăn pơlei 'nâu adrol sơ̆ đe krao Lus."
"And when the spies saw a man coming out of the city, they said to him, “Please show us the entrance to the city, and we will show you mercy.”","Lu bơngai năm lăng adrol 'bôh minh 'nu lĕch đơ̆ng pơlei, na lu sư khan kơ bơngai ei: Apinh ih tơ'bôh ăn kơ nhôn trong ayơ gơh mơ̆t tơ pơlei na lu nhôn gô mơnat kơ ih."
"So he showed them the entrance to the city, and they struck the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the man and all his family go.","Na bơngai ei tơ'bôh ăn kơ lu sư trong gơh mơ̆t tơ lăm pơlei. Lu sư iŏk đao hơlă pơlôch lu bơngai lăm pơlei 'nei; mă-lei lu sư lê̆ bơngai noh păng đĭ hnam dơnŏ sư oei arih"
"And the man went to the land of the Hittites, built a city, and called its name Luz, which is its name to this day.","Thoi noh lu bơngai noh năm mơ̆t tơ dêh char Hêtit, pơm pơlei oei tơ noh na sư anăn pơlei ei Lus, đe oei krao anăn ei truh tơ dang ei."
"However, Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shean and its villages, or Taanach and its villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages; for the Canaanites were determined to dwell in that land.","Bơngai Manase ưh kơ gơh puh lê̆ lu kon pơlei oei tơ Bêt Sêan păng pơlei oei jum dăr ưh kơ tam, kon pơlei oei tơ Tanak păng lu pơlei jum dăr kơ sư kư̆m ưh kơ tam, lu kon pơlei oei tơ Đôr păng pơlei oei jum dăr kơ sư, kon pơlei oei tơ Iblêam păng pơlei jum dăr kơ sư, pơlei oei tơ Mêgiđô păng rim pơlei mă sư pơgơ̆r, na sư kư̆m ưh kơ gơh pơpuh lê̆ tơ nai, yua kơ đei lu kon pơlei Kanaan oei tơ lăm lu pơlei ei."
"And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites under tribute, but did not completely drive them out.","Dĭng khŭl bơngai Isơrael pran boih, na rôp kon pơlei Kanaan pơgŏ lu sư jang pơmat-tat, mă-lei ưh kơ đei layơ gơh pơpuh đĭ lu sư năm tơ nai."
"Nor did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites who dwelt in Gezer; so the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.","Bơngai Êphraim kư̆m ưh kơ gơh pơpuh tơweh kon pơlei Kanaan oei tơ Geser thoi noh lu kon pơlei Kanaan oei oei hơdai hăm bơngai Êphraim."
"Nor did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron or the inhabitants of Nahalol; so the Canaanites dwelt among them, and were put under tribute.","Bơngai Sebulun kư̆m ưh kơ gơh pơpuh tơweh kon pơlei oei tơ Kitrôn, dah kon pơlei oei tơ Nahalô, bơngai Kanaan oei hơdai hăm bơngai Sabulun, mă-lei pơgŏ athei lu sư jang pơmat-tat."
"Nor did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Acco or the inhabitants of Sidon, or of Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, or Rehob.","Bơngai Aser kư̆m ưh kơ gơh pơpuh tơweh kon pơlei oei tơ Akô, dah kon pơlei oei tơ Siđôn, kon pơlei oei tơ Ahlap, kon pơlei oei tơ Aksip, kon pơlei oei tơ Helba, kon pơlei oei tơ Aphik dah kon pơlei oei tơ Rêhôp."
"So the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out.","Thoi noh bơngai Aser pơjing tơdrong jang sa lu sư tŏk-bŏk lăm kon pơlei Kanaan mă oei tơ noh yua kơ bơngai Aser ưh kơ gơh pơpuh tơweh lu sư năm tơ nai."
"Nor did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh or the inhabitants of Beth Anath; but they dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land. Nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath were put under tribute to them.","Bơngai Neptali ưh kơ gơh pơpuh tơweh kon pơlei oei tơ Bêt Sêmes păng kon pơlei oei tơ Bêt Hanat; na lu sư oei tŏk-bŏk lăm kon pơlei Kanaan mă-lei kon pơlei Bêt Sêmê păng kon pơlei Bêt Anat lu bơngai Neptali pơgŏ athei lu sư jang pơmat-tat."
"And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountains, for they would not allow them to come down to the valley","Kon pơlei Amôrit pơpôi pơpuh lu bơngai Đan oei tơ kơpal groi kông, ưh kơ ăn lu sư jur oei tơ thŭng."
"and the Amorites were determined to dwell in Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim; yet when the strength of the house of Joseph became greater, they were put under tribute.","Kon pơlei Amôrit kư̆m oei tơ kông Hares, Aijalôn păng Salbim; mă-lei adrĕch adrung Jôsep sư pran na lu sư athei bơngai Amôrit jang kơ lu sư gleh pơmat."
"Now the boundary of the Amorites was from the Ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela, and upward.","Anih teh kon pơlei Amôrit iŏk đơ̆ng kuĕl Akrabim, păng đơ̆ng Sêla truh tơ ti ti."
"Then the Angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said: “I led you up from Egypt and brought you to the land of which I swore to your fathers; and I said, ‘I will never break My covenant with you.","Linh jang 'lơ̆ng Kră Yang năm tŏk đơ̆ng pơlei Gilgal truh tơ Bôkim păng khan thoi âu: Inh chông ba lu iĕm hlôi đơ̆ng dêh Êyiptơ boih, ba iĕm mơ̆t tơ dêh char mă Inh đei pơkă hăm 'bok yă wă ăn kơ adrĕch adrung lu sư. Inh đei khan kơ iĕm. ‘Inh ưh kơ đei layơ hŭt lê̆ dôm tơdrong mă Inh pơkă hăm lu iĕm"
"And you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall tear down their altars.’ But you have not obeyed My voice. Why have you done this?","Mă gah lu iĕm, 'nĕ kơ pơgơ̆p băl hăm lu bơngai mă oei tơ char âu; iĕm athei pơrăm lê̆ lu rup yang lu sư.’ Mă-lei iĕm ưh kơ mơ̆ng nơ̆r Inh khan. Yua kơ kiơ lu iĕm pơm tơdrong noh?"
"Therefore I also said, ‘I will not drive them out before you; but they shall be thorns in your side, and their gods shall be a snare to you.’ ”","Na kư̆m thoi Inh đei khan boih, Inh ưh kơ đei pơpuh tơweh kon pơlei noh ataih kơ lu iĕm, lu sư gô oei jê̆ lu iĕm păng tơdrong lu sư pơm yang nhen thoi poh-'năk wă đăk kơ lu iĕm."
"So it was, when the Angel of the LORD spoke these words to all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voices and wept.","Lăp linh jang 'lơ̆ng Kră Yang pơma kơ kon pơlei Isơrael tôch boih, na lu kon pơlei pơla nhơ̆m ôr."
"Then they called the name of that place Bochim; and they sacrificed there to the LORD.","Lu sư krao anăn anih noh Bôkim wă khan lu bơngai nhơ̆m păng pơyơ̆r kơ Kră Yang tơmam soi tơ anih noh."
"And when Joshua had dismissed the people, the children of Israel went each to his own inheritance to possess the land.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ Jôsuê ăn kơ kon pơlei brŏk, na đĭ rim 'nu bơngai Isơrael, năm iŏk dêh mă đei hlang lăng trŏ kơ sư."
"So the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD which He had done for Israel.","Kon pơlei pơla chu yom kơ Kră Yang ling-lang truh tơ Jôsuê păng bơngai đe kră arih đunh hloh kơ Jôsuê lôch, noh lu bơngai mă 'bôh tơdrong jang mơsêh tih dêh mă đêl Kră Yang pơm boih yua kơ lu bơngai Isơrael."
"Now Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died when he was one hundred and ten years old.","Jôsuê kon drŏ-nglo Nun đĭch đam Kră Yang lôch, sư arih đei minh-hrĕng mơjĭt sơnăm"
"And they buried him within the border of his inheritance at Timnath Heres, in the mountains of Ephraim, on the north side of Mount Gaash.","đe 'bŭ sư lăm teh hnam sư kơdih tơ Timnat Hêres kơpal groi kông Êphraim gah yă-nơ̆m kơ kông Gaas."
"When all that generation had been gathered to their fathers, another generation arose after them who did not know the LORD nor the work which He had done for Israel.","Đĭ-đăng jơhnơr ei lĕch kiơ̆ yă 'bok lu sư; na đei minh jơhnơr nai iung dơ̆ng mă ưh kơ băt kơ Kră Yang păng kư̆m ưh kơ 'bôh dôm tơdrong mơsêh Kră Yang đei pơm yua kơ lu bơngai Isơrael."
"Then the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served the Baals","Kơplah noh lu bơngai Isơrael pơm kơnê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, kơkuh kơ lu rup yang Baal"
"and they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt; and they followed other gods from among the gods of the people who were all around them, and they bowed down to them; and they provoked the LORD to anger.","Hŭt lê̆ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei 'bok yă lu sư, Tơ'ngla mă chông lu sư lĕch đơ̆ng dêh Êyiptơ. Lu sư lui kiơ̆ kơ yang nai đơ̆ng lu adrĕch adrung jum dăr kơ lu sư, drap kơkuh kơ lu yang noh păng pơm kơ Kră Yang hil blĕk kơ lu sư."
"They forsook the LORD and served Baal and the Ashtoreths.","Thoi noh lu sư lê̆ Kră Yang drap kơkuh kơ yang Baal păng Astarôt."
"And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel. So He delivered them into the hands of plunderers who despoiled them; and He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around, so that they could no longer stand before their enemies.","Kră Yang blĕk kơ bơngai Isơrael păng pơjao lu sư ăn kơ lu bơngai tơgar iŏk mŭk tơmam lu sư, na lu bơngai Isơrael ưh kơ gơh pơm kiơ kơ lu bơngai ayăt areh kơ lu sư."
"Wherever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for calamity, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn to them. And they were greatly distressed.","Mă lu sư năm tơ yơ yơ Kră Yang kư̆m ăn kơ lu sư đei tơdrong gleh pơmat 'blep thoi Kră Yang khan pơkă kơ lu sư. Lu sư đei tơdrong gleh pơmat tih dêh."
"Nevertheless, the LORD raised up judges who delivered them out of the hand of those who plundered them.","Na Kră Yang rơih hơtŏk lu 'bok sek tơlang dŏng pơklaih lu sư đơ̆ng bơngai ayăt."
"Yet they would not listen to their judges, but they played the harlot with other gods, and bowed down to them. They turned quickly from the way in which their fathers walked, in obeying the commandments of the LORD; they did not do so.","Mă-lei lu sư kư̆m ưh kơ wă mơ̆ng lu 'bok sek tơlang lu sư kiơ̆ kơkuh kơ yang nai. Lu sư ưh kơ rok kiơ̆ trong mă đêl yă 'bok lu sư yak, ưh kơ rok kiơ̆ păng ưh kơ wei răk tơdrong juăt Kră Yang."
"And when the LORD raised up judges for them, the LORD was with the judge and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for the LORD was moved to pity by their groaning because of those who oppressed them and harassed them.","Kơplah Kră Yang rơih lu 'bok sek tơlang ăn kơ lu bơngai Isơrael, Sư oei hơdai hăm lu 'bok sek tơlang noh păng yua lu sư pơklaih lu bơngai Isơrael đơ̆ng ti lu bơngai mă ayăt kơ lu sư Kră Yang mơnat kơ lu sư ôr krao yua kơ ayăt lu bơngai pơm kơnê̆ pơjuă pơđep lu sư."
"And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they reverted and behaved more corruptly than their fathers, by following other gods, to serve them and bow down to them. They did not cease from their own doings nor from their stubborn way.","Mă-lei đơ̆ng rŏng kơ 'bok sek tơlang noh lôch na lu bơngai Isơrael pơm kơnê̆ hloh dơ̆ng kơ adrol, lui kiơ̆ kơkuh kơ lu yang nai; lu bơngai Isơrael ưh kơ chu hŭt lê̆ tơdrong kơnê̆, oei rok kiơ̆ trong kơnê̆ khŏm khŏm."
"Then the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and He said, “Because this nation has transgressed My covenant which I commanded their fathers, and has not heeded My voice","Yua kơ thoi noh Kră Yang blĕk kơ bơngai Isơrael păng Sư khan thoi âu: Yua kơ lu bơngai âu ưh kơ chu kiơ̆ nơ̆r Inh pơkă kơ yă 'bok lu sư păng lu sư kư̆m ưh kơ chu mơ̆ng kiơ̆ nơ̆r Inh khan"
"I also will no longer drive out before them any of the nations which Joshua left when he died","na gah Inh, kư̆m ưh kơ pơpuh lu bơngai ayăt kơ lu sư mă đêl oei kơplah Jôsuê oei arih, mă Jôsuê lôch boih."
"so that through them I may test Israel, whether they will keep the ways of the LORD, to walk in them as their fathers kept them, or not.”","Inh ăn kơ lu ayăt kơ lu sư oei tơ noh Inh wă pơlong lăng lu bơngai Isơrael, lu sư hăm oei đei wei păng rok kiơ̆ trong Kră Yang thoi lu 'bok yă lu sư mă đêl oei tơ noh ưh."
"Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out immediately; nor did He deliver them into the hand of Joshua.","Yua kơ thoi noh na Kră Yang lê̆ lu bơngai ayăt 'nâu oei lăm dêh lu sư, ưh kơ hăt hot pơpuh tơlĕch lu sư năm tơ nai păng ưh kơ pơjao lu sư lăm ti Jôsuê."
"Now these are the nations which the LORD left, that He might test Israel by them, that is, all who had not known any of the wars in Canaan","'Nâu boih lu adrĕch adrung mă Kră Yang lê̆ oei đei, yua kơ wă pơlong lăng lu bơngai Isơrael tam mă đei layơ 'bôh tơdrong tơblah tơ dêh char Kanaan."
"(this was only so that the generations of the children of Israel might be taught to know war, at least those who had not formerly known it)","Sư wă pơlong lăng lu bơngai Isơrael, wă pơhrăm pơjuăt lu sư tơdrong tơblah, mă loi lu bơngai tam đei 'bôh tơdrong tơblah sơ̆"
"namely, five lords of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who dwelt in Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of Hamath.","Đei pơđăm 'nu pơm yŏng pơgơ̆r kon pơlei Philistin, đĭ-đăng lu kon pơlei Kanaan kon pơlei Siđôn păng kon pơlei Hêwit oei tơ lăm lu kông Liban, đơ̆ng kông Baal Hermôn truh tơ pơlei Lêbơ Hamat."
"And they were left, that He might test Israel by them, to know whether they would obey the commandments of the LORD, which He had commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.","Kră Yang yua lu adrĕch adrung 'nâu wă pơlong lăng lu bơngai Isơrael, wă lăng lăng lu bơngai Isơrael hăm chu kiơ̆ tơdrong juăt mă Kră Yang chih ăn kơ Môis bơtho kơ lu adrĕch adrung lu sư."
"Thus the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.","Thoi noh kon pơlei Isơrael oei hơdai hăm kon pơlei Kanaan, kon pơlei Hêtit, kon pơlei Amôrit, kon pơlei Phêrisit, kon pơlei Hêwit păng kon pơlei Jêbus"
"And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons; and they served their gods.","lu sư iŏk kon adruh đe noh pơm akăn păng ăn kon drŏ-kăn lu sư oei kơ kon tơdăm đe noh păng kơkuh kiơ̆ kơ yang đe noh. Chih roi gah lu 'bok sek tơlang"
"So the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD. They forgot the LORD their God, and served the Baals and Asherahs.","Kon pơlei Isơrael pơm tơdrong kơnê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, hiơt kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu sư, bơ̆jang kơkuh kơ rup yang Baal păng yang Asêrôt."
"Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and He sold them into the hand of Cushan-Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia; and the children of Israel served Cushan-Rishathaim eight years.","Yua kơ thoi noh, Kră Yang hil blĕk kơ lu bơngai Isơrael, Kră Yang pơjao lu sư lăm ti Kusan Risathaim, pơtao teh đak Mesôpôtami. Kusan Risathaim pơgŏ pơđep kon pơlei Isơrael lăm tơhngam sơnăm."
"When the children of Israel cried out to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer for the children of Israel, who delivered them: Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother.","Mă-lei mưh lu kon pơlei Isơrael krao ôr apinh Kră Yang na Kră Yang rơih ăn kơ lu sư minh 'nu bơngai dŏng pơklaih, noh anăn sư Ôtniêl, kon drŏ-nglo Kênas, oh tơtil Kalep; bơngai ei dŏng pơklaih lu sư."
"The Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel. He went out to war, and the LORD delivered Cushan-Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed over Cushan-Rishathaim.","Yang bơhngol 'lơ̆ng Kră Yang jur tơ Ôtniêl na sư jing bơngai sek tơlang Isơrael lĕch năm tơblah.

"So the land had rest for forty years. Then Othniel the son of Kenaz died.","Dêh char bơngai Isơrael đei rơngei hơđơ̆ng lăm puăn-jĭt sơnăm; truh tơ Ôtniêl, kon drŏ-nglo Kênas lôch."
"And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD. So the LORD strengthened Eglon king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.","Kon pơlei Isơrael pơm kơnê̆ dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, na Kră Yang ăn kơ Eglôn, pơtao Môap jing pran năm wang blah Isơrael yua kơ lu sư pơm yoch kơnê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang."
"Then he gathered to himself the people of Ammon and Amalek, went and defeated Israel, and took possession of the City of Palms.","Thoi noh Eglôn akŭm hơdai hăm kon pơlei Ammôn păng kon pơlei Amalek năm blah kon pơlei Isơrael jei lu sư; păng đei blah iŏk pơgơ̆r pơlei 'Long gol. a"
"So the children of Israel served Eglon king of Moab eighteen years.","Eglôn pơtao char Môap pơjuă pơđep kon pơlei Isơrael lăm mơjĭt-tơhngam sơnăm."
"But when the children of Israel cried out to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer for them: Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a left-handed man. By him the children of Israel sent tribute to Eglon king of Moab.","Mă-lei mưh kon pơlei Isơrael krao ôr apinh Kră Yang, Kră Yang rơih ăn kơ lu sư minh 'nu 'bok dŏng pơklaih, anăn sư Êhut, kon drŏ-nglo Gêra, sư adrĕch Bênjamin. 'Noh bơngai juăt kơ yua ti gah 'ngiĕo. Kon pơlei Isơrael wơh sư chĕp ba tơmam ra ăn kơ Eglôn, pơtao Môap."
"Now Ehud made himself a dagger (it was double-edged and a cubit in length) and fastened it under his clothes on his right thigh.","Êhut pơm kơdih sư minh hlak đao gưm 'bar pah măt, kơjung minh (hơgăt) păng tơ̆n đao gưm tơ kơiĕng gah 'ma, tah tơ lăm kơ ao sư."
"So he brought the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. (Now Eglon was a very fat man.)","Thoi noh sư chĕp ba, tơmam đe ra ăn kơ Eglôn, pơtao Môap. Eglôn sư bơngai tih bek dêh."
"And when he had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people who had carried the tribute.","Đang kơ noh, na Êhut ăn kơ lu bơngai chĕp tơmam ra noh brŏk."
"But he himself turned back from the stone images that were at Gilgal, and said, “I have a secret message for you, O king.” He said, “Keep silence!” And all who attended him went out from him.","Mă-lei sư kơdih wih tơ rŏng tơ sơlŭng đe iŏk tơmo jê̆ tơ Gilgal, na wơ̆t brŏk khan: Ơ pơtao, inh đei minh nơ̆r hlơp wă roi kơ ih. Na pơtao athei: Thĕng bĕ! Na đĭ-đăng kơ lu bơngai bơ̆jang kơ pơtao lĕch tơ 'nguaih."
"So Ehud came to him (now he was sitting upstairs in his cool private chamber). Then Ehud said, “I have a message from God for you.” So he arose from his seat.","Kơplah pơtao oei ngôi minh drô̆ tơ anih kơpal rơngơp, Êhut năm jê̆ na khan. Inh đei minh nơ̆r đơ̆ng Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei wă roi ăn kơ ih. Na Eglôn iung hloi đơ̆ng tang-dŏ sư."
"Then Ehud reached with his left hand, took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly.","Êhut yơ̆r ti 'ngiĕo sư toh iŏk đao đơ̆ng kơiĕng sư, na 'bet hloi 'bơ̆t klak."
"Even the hilt went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not draw the dagger out of his belly; and his entrails came out.","Gơ̆r đao kư̆m han mơ̆t kiơ̆ măt đao Êhut sư ưh kơ gơh toh đao sư. Yua kơ Eglôn bek dêh rơmă klak sư klơp lê̆ đao."
"Then Ehud went out through the porch and shut the doors of the upper room behind him and locked them.","Đơ̆ng noh, Êhut lĕch đơ̆ng anih 'nei trong kơdeng păng tang khuă chơkăl lê̆ 'măng anih noh gah rŏng sư."
"When he had gone out, Eglon’s servants came to look, and to their surprise, the doors of the upper room were locked. So they said, “He is probably attending to his needs in the cool chamber.”","Đơ̆ng rong kơ Êhut lĕch boih đơ̆ng hnam, lu đĭch đam pơtao năm lăng; 'bôh 'măng hnam tơ kơpal noh tang chơkăl ngăl boih, na pơma dih băl khan: Băt dah pơtao oei pơdơh tơ hnam kơpal kơlĕ."
"So they waited till they were embarrassed, and still he had not opened the doors of the upper room. Therefore they took the key and opened them. And there was their master, fallen dead on the floor.","Lu sư gô đunh dêh, dĭng mah pă băt pơm liơ; yua kơ ưh 'bôh pơtao pơih 'măng hnam, na lu sư iŏk khuă păng pơih 'măng anih noh, 'bôh yŏng lu sư lôch boih, 'bơ̆t hơnă hnam."
"But Ehud had escaped while they delayed, and passed beyond the stone images and escaped to Seirah.","Kơplah lu sư oei gô, Êhut kơdâu klĕnh hlôi trong cheng rok sơlŭng đe iŏk kơ tơmo kơdâu truh tơ pơlei Sêira."
"And it happened, when he arrived, that he blew the trumpet in the mountains of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mountains; and he led them.","Lăp sư truh tơ noh sư hlôm keng tơ lăm groi kông Êphraim; na kon pơlei Isơrael jur hơdai hăm sư đơ̆ng kơpal kông păng sư pơm yŏng chông ba lu sư."
"Then he said to them, “Follow me, for the LORD has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand.” So they went down after him, seized the fords of the Jordan leading to Moab, and did not allow anyone to cross over.","Êhut khan kơ lu sư: Kiơ̆ inh bĕ, yua kơ Kră Yang jao boih kon pơlei Môap lăm ti lu iĕm, bơngai mă ayăt kơ lu iĕm.

"And at that time they killed about ten thousand men of Moab, all stout men of valor; not a man escaped.","Lăm kơplah noh kon pơlei Isơrael đei pơlôch dang mơjĭt-rơbâu 'nu bơngai Môap, đĭ lu sư noh bơngai kơtang nuih ưh kơ đei minh 'nu klaih."
"So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest for eighty years.","Lăm năr noh, bơngai Isơrael pơgŏ pơđep kon pơlei Môap; dêh char sư hơđơ̆ng rơngei hiôk lăm tơhngam-jĭt sơnăm."
"After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who killed six hundred men of the Philistines with an ox goad; and he also delivered Israel.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ Êhut đei Samgar, kon drŏ-nglo Anat, sư yua minh tŏ 'long sơnguĕt suĕng đe puh rơmo na teh pơlôch tơdrâu-hrĕng 'nu bơngai Philistin na sư dŏng pơklaih lu bơngai Isơrael."
"When Ehud was dead, the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ Êhut lôch boih, na kon pơlei Isơrael pơm kơnê̆ dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang."
"So the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his army was Sisera, who dwelt in Harosheth Hagoyim.","Kră Yang jao lu sư lăm ti Jabin pơtao Kanaan, pơgơ̆r tơ pơlei Hasor. Yŏng pơgơ̆r linh noh Sisêra sư oei tơ pơlei Harôsêt Hagôim."
"And the children of Israel cried out to the LORD; for Jabin had nine hundred chariots of iron, and for twenty years he had harshly oppressed the children of Israel.","Yua kơ pơtao Jabin đei tơsĭn-hrĕng tŏ gre aseh đe pơm păng mam păng lăm 'bar-jĭt sơnăm sư pơgŏ pơđep pơm kơnê̆ kơ lu bơngai Isơrael, na kon pơlei Isơrael krao apinh Kră Yang tơgŭm."
"Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, was judging Israel at that time.","Lăm kơplah noh, Đêbôra bơngai drŏ-kăn khan lê̆ adrol, akăn Lapiđôt, yă sek tơlang kon pơlei Isơrael."
"And she would sit under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the mountains of Ephraim. And the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.","Sư juăt kơ oei ngôi ala tơnơm 'long gol tơ kơpal groi kông Êphraim sơlam pơlei Rama păng Bethel, na lu kon pơlei Isơrael tŏk năm truh tơ sư, wă kơ sư sek tơlang ăn."
"Then she sent and called for Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali, and said to him, “Has not the LORD God of Israel commanded, ‘Go and deploy troops at Mount Tabor; take with you ten thousand men of the sons of Naphtali and of the sons of Zebulun","Yă ei wơh athei đe krao Barak kon drŏ-nglo Abinôam đơ̆ng pơlei Kêđes lăm dêh char Naptali, na khan kơ sư: Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael tơtă kơ ih: Năm rơih akŭm minh-rơbâu 'nu bơngai đơ̆ng adrĕch Naptali păng lăm kon sâu Sebulun păng tŏk tơ kông Tabôr"
"and against you I will deploy Sisera, the commander of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his multitude at the River Kishon; and I will deliver him into your hand’?”","Inh gô ba Sisêra, 'bok yŏng pơgơ̆r linh pơtao Jabin, hăm đĭ lu gre aseh sư păng đĭ lu linh sư năm tơ'bơ̆p iĕm tơ thong đak krong Kisôn; Inh gô pơjao sư lăm ti ih."
"And Barak said to her, “If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go!”","Barak tơl khan: Tơdah ih năm hơdai hăm inh, inh gô năm. Tơdah ih ưh kơ năm hơdai hăm inh, inh ưh kơ năm."
"So she said, “I will surely go with you; nevertheless there will be no glory for you in the journey you are taking, for the LORD will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman.” Then Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh.","Yă ei tơl, sĭt tơpă inh gô năm hơdai hăm ih; mă-lei trong ih yak năm 'nâu ưh kơ đei ư-ang kơ ih ôh, yua kơ Kră Yang gô pơjao Sisêra lăm tơpang ti minh 'nu bơngai drŏ-kăn. Thoi noh Đêbôra iung yak năm hơdai hăm Barak truh tơ pơlei Kiđes."
"And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; he went up with ten thousand men under his command, and Deborah went up with him.","Barak krao akŭm pơpôi bơngai Sebulun păng bơngai Naptali năm tơ pơlei Kêđes, đe mơjĭt-rơbâu 'nu bơngai kiơ̆ sư păng Đêbôra năm hơdai sư."
"Now Heber the Kenite, of the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, had separated himself from the Kenites and pitched his tent near the terebinth tree at Zaanaim, which is beside Kedesh.","Hêber bơngai Kênit sư weh boih đơ̆ng lu kon pơlei Kênit sư noh, kon sâu Hôbap 'nhŏng oh akăn Môis; sư năm pơm bơsŭn jê̆ tơ tơm 'long tih tơ Sananim, jê̆ Kêđes."
"And they reported to Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor.","Đe roi ăn kơ Sisêra băt kơ Barak, kon drŏ-nglo Abinôam, năm tŏk boih tơ kông Tabôr."
"So Sisera gathered together all his chariots, nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth Hagoyim to the River Kishon.","Sisêra akŭm đĭ gre aseh, đei tơsĭn-hrĕng tŏ gre aseh păng đĭ lu linh sư đơ̆ng pơlei Harôsêt Hagôim năm truh tơ thong đak krong Kisôn."
"Then Deborah said to Barak, “Up! For this is the day in which the LORD has delivered Sisera into your hand. Has not the LORD gone out before you?” So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men following him.","Đêbôra pơma hăm Barak khan: Iung bĕ!

"And the LORD routed Sisera and all his chariots and all his army with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted from his chariot and fled away on foot.","Kră Yang yua đao gưm pơm pơrŭng Sisêra păng đĭ lu gre aseh bơsei sư hăm đĭ-đăng lu linh sư kơdâu tơklah tơklang kơ Barak.

"But Barak pursued the chariots and the army as far as Harosheth Hagoyim, and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; not a man was left.","Barak druh kiơ̆ gre aseh păng khŭl linh dĭng truh tơ Harôsêt Hagôim păng đĭ-đăng lu linh Sisêra đe pơlôch hăm đao gưm ưh pă đei lê̆ minh 'nu bơngai bu."
"However, Sisera had fled away on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.","Sisêra kơdâu ôn jơ̆ng hoh truh tơ bơsŭn Jăl, akăn Hêber bơngai Kênit; yua kơ Jabin, pơtao Hasor păng adrĕch Hêber bơngai Kênit hiôk hơiă dih băl."
"And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, “Turn aside, my lord, turn aside to me; do not fear.” And when he had turned aside with her into the tent, she covered him with a blanket.","Yă Jăl lĕch sơng iŏk Sisêra na khan kơ sư: Ơ 'bok yŏng mơ̆t bĕ tơ hnam inh 'nĕ kơ hli. Thoi noh na sư mơ̆t lăm bơsŭn yă ei păng yă ei iŏk khăn tơsu kơ sư."
"Then he said to her, “Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty.” So she opened a jug of milk, gave him a drink, and covered him.","Sư pơma hăm yă ei khan: Inh apinh ih song inh đak nhă tŏ sĕt, inh 'maih nhă dêh. Yă ei iŏk get akar đak toh rơmo ăn kơ Sisêra nhă; đơ̆ng noh tơsu kơ sư khăn dơ̆ng."
"And he said to her, “Stand at the door of the tent, and if any man comes and inquires of you, and says, ‘Is there any man here?’ you shall say, ‘No.’ ”","Na sư khan kơ yă ei dơ̆ng: Athei dơ̆ng bĕ 'bơ̆t 'măng bơsŭn ih, tơdah đei bu apinh ih, tơ âu hăm đei bu ưh, tơl ưh kơ đei bơngai bu."
"Then Jael, Heber’s wife, took a tent peg and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him and drove the peg into his temple, and it went down into the ground; for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.","Đơ̆ng noh Sisêra tep hiơt, yua kơ lap dêh.

"And then, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, “Come, I will show you the man whom you seek.” And when he went into her tent, there lay Sisera, dead with the peg in his temple.","Barak oei druh 'moi Sisêra, Jăl lĕch sơng, na khan: Năm lăng bĕ, inh gô tơ'bôh ăn kơ ih bơngai mă ih oei chơchă.

"So on that day God subdued Jabin king of Canaan in the presence of the children of Israel.","Lăm năr noh Kră Yang ăn kơ Jabin pơtao Kanaan chu bơngai Isơrael."
"And the hand of the children of Israel grew stronger and stronger against Jabin king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.","Lu bơngai Isơrael rai đunh rai pran blah iŏk Jabin jei sư, pơtao Kanaan dĭng truh kơ sư pơlôch pơrăm đĭ."
"Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying","Lăm năr ei, Đêbôra hăm Barak, kon drŏ-nglo Abinôam hơri nơ̆r âu"
"“When leaders lead in Israel, When the people willingly offer themselves, Bless the LORD!","Kơplah lu 'bok pơgơ̆r wei-lăng lăm bơngai Isơrael, Păng kơplah kon pơlei pơla pơyơ̆r akâu lu sư hăm jơhngơ̆m hiôk! Kơkuh hơri ư-ang Kră Yang."
"“Hear, O kings! Give ear, O princes! I, even I, will sing to the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.","Ơ lu pơtao, mơ̆ng bĕ! Ơ lu 'bok pơgơ̆r, pơđêng bĕ đon! Inh gô hơri ăn kơ Kră Yang, minh bai. Inh gô hơri bơnê kơ Kră Yang, 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael."
"“LORD, when You went out from Seir, When You marched from the field of Edom, The earth trembled and the heavens poured, The clouds also poured water","Ơ Kră Yang kơplah Ih lĕch đơ̆ng dêh Sêir, kơplah Ih yak rok char Eđôm, Na teh tơdrŏ, plĕnh tơjur đak 'mi. Hơmơ̆l tơjur đak 'mi."
"The mountains gushed before the LORD, This Sinai, before the LORD God of Israel.","'Bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, đĭ-đăng kông pơpơ̆, Kông Sinai pơpơ̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael."
"“In the days of Shamgar, son of Anath, In the days of Jael, The highways were deserted, And the travelers walked along the byways.","Lăm chăl Samgar kon drŏ-nglo Anat, Lăm chăl Jăl, rim trong tih ưh pă đei bu rok, Lu bơngai tơmoi chă yak rok kiơ̆ trong đŏng đĕo"
"Village life ceased, it ceased in Israel, Until I, Deborah, arose, Arose a mother in Israel.","Tơdrong arih kon pơlei lăm lu pơlei iĕ oei dơ̆ng. Inh Đêbôra iung Thoi minh 'nu mĕ lăm bơngai Isơrael."
"They chose new gods; Then there was war in the gates; Not a shield or spear was seen among forty thousand in Israel.","Đe rơih iŏk boih lu yang 'nao; Na lu bơngai ayăt mơ̆t tơblah truh tơ 'măng dur pơlei.

"My heart is with the rulers of Israel Who offered themselves willingly with the people. Bless the LORD!","Jơhngơ̆m inh 'mêm kơ lu yŏng pơgơ̆r linh Isơrael, Lu sư pơyơ̆r akâu sư kơdih hăm jơhngơ̆m hiôk; tơgŭm teh đak, tơgŭm kon pơlei hơri ư-ang kơ Kră Yang!"

"Far from the noise of the archers, among the watering places, There they shall recount the righteous acts of the LORD, The righteous acts for His villagers in Israel; Then the people of the LORD shall go down to the gates.","Roi bĕ kơ lu bơngai reh brŏ oei reh tơ kơdrơ̆m đak, Wă kơ lu sư gô hơri pơlơ̆k dơ̆ng pơlơ̆k dơ̆ng tơdrong kĕ jei Kră Yang.

"“Thus let all Your enemies perish, O LORD! But let those who love Him be like the sun When it comes out in full strength.” So the land had rest for forty years.","Ơ Kră Yang, Ăn đĭ kơ lu ayăt kơ Ih lôch hiong răm thoi noh!

"Then the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD. So the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian for seven years","Lu bơngai Isơrael pơm tơdrong kơnê̆ dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang; na Kră Yang jao lu sư lăm ti kon pơlei Miđian lăm tơpơh sơnăm."
"and the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel. Because of the Midianites, the children of Israel made for themselves the dens, the caves, and the strongholds which are in the mountains.","Lu bơngai Miđian blah lu bơngai Isơrael jei lu sư; yua kơ lu bơngai Isơrael hli kơ lu bơngai Miđian na lu bơngai Isơrael kơdâu ôn oei tơ kông kŏ, lăm sơlŭng lăm hơgơp tơmo dah chă ôn tơ lăm lu pơlei kơjăp."
"So it was, whenever Israel had sown, Midianites would come up; also Amalekites and the people of the East would come up against them.","Mưh lu bơngai Isơrael chă rei adrĕch, kon pơlei Miđian hăm kon pơlei Amalek păng bơngai đơ̆ng gah hơlĕch năm blah bơngai Isơrael."
"Then they would encamp against them and destroy the produce of the earth as far as Gaza, and leave no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep nor ox nor donkey.","Lu sư pơm anih linh wă chă pơrăm lu sư, pơrăm đĭ-đăng tơmam sa plei sa truh tơ tơring Gasa ưh pă đei lê̆ minh tơmam sa kiơ kơ lu bơngai Isơrael, mă triu, rơmo dah aseh iĕ."
"For they would come up with their livestock and their tents, coming in as numerous as locusts; both they and their camels were without number; and they would enter the land to destroy it.","Yua kơ bơngai hăm sem dơrong lu sư truh pơm anih lơ tơpă thoi lep tung-nut.

"So Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites, and the children of Israel cried out to the LORD.","Yua kơ kon pơlei Miđian na lu bơngai Isơrael pơmat-tat pơngot rơwĕt dêh tơpă. Na lu bơngai Isơrael nhơ̆m krao apinh Kră Yang tơgŭm."
"And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried out to the LORD because of the Midianites","Lăp lu bơngai Isơrael krao apinh Kră Yang, yua kơ lu bơngai Miđian"
"that the LORD sent a prophet to the children of Israel, who said to them, “Thus says the LORD God of Israel: ‘I brought you up from Egypt and brought you out of the house of bondage","na Kră Yang wơh minh 'nu bơngai khan lê̆ adrol năm tơ kon pơlei Isơrael.

"and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out before you and gave you their land.","Inh dŏng pơklaih lu iĕm đơ̆ng ti lu bơngai Êyiptơ păng klaih iĕm đơ̆ng lu bơngai pơjuă pơđep lu iĕm; Inh pơpuh lê̆ lu sư weh ataih đơ̆ng lu iĕm; păng ăn boih kơ lu iĕm iŏk dêh char lu sư."
"Also I said to you, “I am the LORD your God; do not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell.” But you have not obeyed My voice.’ ”","Inh đei khan kơ lu iĕm: Inh boih Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu iĕm; 'nĕ kơ drap kơkuh kơ lu yang kon pơlei Amôrit lăm dêh char mă lu iĕm oei.

"Now the Angel of the LORD came and sat under the terebinth tree which was in Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, while his son Gideon threshed wheat in the winepress, in order to hide it from the Midianites.","Linh jang 'lơ̆ng Kră Yang năm ngôi tơ ala yơ̆p 'long kôih tơ pơlei Ôphra, lăm dêh char Jôas, adrĕch bơngai Abierit kơplah noh Giđêôn kon drŏ-nglo Jôas, oei pơjuă ba tơ anih đe hơmet đak hơmu wă ôn kơ lu bơngai Miđian."
"And the Angel of the LORD appeared to him, and said to him, “The LORD is with you, you mighty man of valor!”","Linh jang 'lơ̆ng Kră Yang tơ'bôh kơ sư na khan: Ơ bơngai nuih kơtang, Kră Yang oei hơdai ih!"
"Gideon said to Him, “O my lord, if the LORD is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are all His miracles which our fathers told us about, saying, ‘Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?’ But now the LORD has forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.”","Giđêôn tơl: Ơ Yŏng tơ'ngla, tơdah Kră Yang oei hơdai lu nhôn, liơ lu nhôn mă đei tơdrong truh thoi âu?

"Then the LORD turned to him and said, “Go in this might of yours, and you shall save Israel from the hand of the Midianites. Have I not sent you?”","Kră Yang wih lăng tơ sư păng khan: Năm bĕ yua hăm jơhngơ̆m pran kơtang ih đei boih năm dŏng pơklaih lu bơngai Isơrael đơ̆ng ti kon pơlei Miđian.

"So he said to Him, “O my Lord, how can I save Israel? Indeed my clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father’s house.”","Giđêôn tơl: Mă-lei Ơ Kră Yang, liơ inh gơh dong pơklaih bơngai Isơrael?

"And the LORD said to him, “Surely I will be with you, and you shall defeat the Midianites as one man.”","Kră Yang khan kơ sư: Inh gô oei hơdai ih, na ih gô blah kon pơlei Miđian jei ih thoi ih blah minh 'nu bơngai."
"Then he said to Him, “If now I have found favor in Your sight, then show me a sign that it is You who talk with me.","Giđêôn khan: Tơdah Kră Yang mơnat kơ inh dang ei, apinh tơ'bôh ăn kơ inh minh tơdrong tơdra wă kơ inh băt tơpă Ih đei khan boih kơ inh?"
"Do not depart from here, I pray, until I come to You and bring out my offering and set it before You.” And He said, “I will wait until you come back.”","Inh apinh Ih 'nĕ kơ weh đơ̆ng âu dĭng truh tơ inh wih brŏk tơ Ih, chĕp ba tơmam soi, pơyơ̆r ăn kơ Ih, Kră Yang khan: Inh gô oei tơ âu dĭng truh ih wih brŏk tơ âu dơ̆ng."
"So Gideon went in and prepared a young goat, and unleavened bread from an ephah of flour. The meat he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot; and he brought them out to Him under the terebinth tree and presented them.","Giđêôn sư mơ̆t lăm bơsŭn sư hơmet 'nhĕm rôp minh pơm kon bơbe păng iŏk minh Ephata tơpŭng hĕch pơm 'bĕng ưh kơ đei 'buih pông.

"The Angel of God said to him, “Take the meat and the unleavened bread and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth.” And he did so.","Linh jang 'lơ̆ng Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei khan kơ sư: Iŏk bĕ 'nhĕm păng 'bĕng ưh kơ đei 'buih pông lê̆ 'bơ̆t kơpal tơmo âu, na tuh đak 'nhĕm tơ kơpal tơmam noh.

"Then the Angel of the LORD put out the end of the staff that was in His hand, and touched the meat and the unleavened bread; and fire rose out of the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread. And the Angel of the LORD departed out of his sight.","Linh jang Kră Yang yơ̆r iŏk chĕp 'long jra sư dan tôt tơmam soi, tơ 'nhĕm păng tơ 'bĕng ưh kơ đei 'buih pông, đei ŭnh lĕch đơ̆ng tơmo, sa lê̆ 'nhĕm păng 'bĕng ưh kơ đei 'buih pông.

"Now Gideon perceived that He was the Angel of the LORD. So Gideon said, “Alas, O Lord GOD! For I have seen the Angel of the LORD face to face.”","Giđêôn sư băt tơpă kơ noh linh jang 'lơ̆ng Kră Yang na Giđêôn khan: Ơ, Kră Yang mă Mơsêh Mơyang.

"Then the LORD said to him, “Peace be with you; do not fear, you shall not die.”","Mă-lei Kră Yang khan: 'Nĕ kơ hli, chơ̆n jơhngơ̆m bĕ; ih ưh kơ lôch ôh."
"So Gideon built an altar there to the LORD, and called it The-LORD-Is-Peace. To this day it is still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.","Giđêôn pơm minh pơm chơnang soi kơ Kră Yang tơ noh.

"Now it came to pass the same night that the LORD said to him, “Take your father’s young bull, the second bull of seven years old, and tear down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the wooden image that is beside it","Kŭm lăm măng noh, Kră Yang khan kơ Giđêôn: Rôp iŏk bĕ kon rơmo dăm 'bă ih păng rôp minh pôm kon rơmo dăm mă 'bar đei tơpơh sơnăm; na pơrăm lê̆ bĕ chơnang soi kơkuh kơ yang Baal.

"and build an altar to the LORD your God on top of this rock in the proper arrangement, and take the second bull and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the image which you shall cut down.”","Đơ̆ng noh ih athei man minh pơm chơnang soi kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ih, tơ kơpal tơmo 'nâu kiơ̆ thoi đei pơkă boih.

"So Gideon took ten men from among his servants and did as the LORD had said to him. But because he feared his father’s household and the men of the city too much to do it by day, he did it by night.","Na Giđêôn rơih iŏk mơjĭt 'nu bơngai lăm lu đĭch đam sư tơgŭm sư wă pơm kiơ̆ thoi nơ̆r Kră Yang đei pơkă!

"And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, there was the altar of Baal, torn down; and the wooden image that was beside it was cut down, and the second bull was being offered on the altar which had been built.","Pơgê hrôih, wă lu kon pơlei iung đơ̆ng tep, 'bôh chơnang soi kơkuh kơ yang Baal pơchah păk hăm gơ̆ng rup yang Asêra gah cheng đe kăl tơpăk boih păng 'bôh kon rơmo dăm mă 'bar đe pơyơ̆r boih tơ chơnang soi mă 'nao pơm noh"
"So they said to one another, “Who has done this thing?” And when they had inquired and asked, they said, “Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing.”","lu sư apinh dih băl khan: Bu pơm tơdrong 'nâu? Đang kơ lu sư apinh păng chă hơlen, khan đei bơngai roi kơ lu sư: Giđêôn kon drŏ-nglo Jôas pơm tơdrong noh."
"Then the men of the city said to Joash, “Bring out your son, that he may die, because he has torn down the altar of Baal, and because he has cut down the wooden image that was beside it.”","Lu kon pơlei pơla khan kơ Jôas: Ăn kon ih lĕch, sư gô lôch yua kơ sư pơrăm chơnang soi kơkuh kơ yang Baal păng kăl tơpăk lê̆ gơ̆ng rup yang Asêra cheng noh hai."
"But Joash said to all who stood against him, “Would you plead for Baal? Would you save him? Let the one who would plead for him be put to death by morning! If he is a god, let him plead for himself, because his altar has been torn down!”","Mă-lei Jôas tơl tơwih kơ lu bơngai wă pơm kơnê̆ hăm sư: Lu iĕm wă blah dŏng yang Baal hă?

"Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, “Let Baal plead against him, because he has torn down his altar.”","Thoi noh lăm năr noh đe krao Giđêôn Jêrup Baal, yua kơ đêl khan, thôi lê̆ kơ yang Baal tơblah hăm 'bok noh. Yua kơ Giđêôn đei pơrăm boih chơnang soi sư!"
"Then all the Midianites and Amalekites, the people of the East, gathered together; and they crossed over and encamped in the Valley of Jezreel.","Đĭ-đăng lu kon pơlei Miđian, kon pơlei Amalek păng lu bơngai đơ̆ng tơring gah hơlĕch pơgơ̆p băl hơdai, năm tŏk tơ pah to kơ đak Krong Jôrđăn, pơm bơsŭn oei tơ thŭng Jêsreel."
"But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon; then he blew the trumpet, and the Abiezrites gathered behind him.","Yang Bơhngol 'lơ̆ng Kră Yang truh oei hơdai Giđêôn; sư hlôm keng krao lu bơngai Abierit akŭm băl kiơ̆ sư."
"And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, who also gathered behind him. He also sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.","Sư wơh lu bơngai năm roi tơbăt tơ jơ̆p-jang kơ bơngai Manase, akŭm pơpôi băl năm kiơ̆ sư.

"So Gideon said to God, “If You will save Israel by my hand as You have said","Giđêôn pơma dơnuh hăm Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei: Tơdah Ih wă yua inh dŏng pơklaih lu bơngai Isơrael, thoi nơ̆r Ih đei khan boih"
"look, I shall put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor; if there is dew on the fleece only, and it is dry on all the ground, then I shall know that You will save Israel by my hand, as You have said.”","na 'nâu inh gô lê̆ akar sŏk triu tơ anih đe pơjuă 'ba; tơdah tŭk jur kơpal sŏk triu đĕch mă-lei tơ teh oei hrĕng kro, noh lei na inh gô băt kơnăl kơ Ih wă yua inh dŏng pơklaih lu bơngai Isơrael thoi Ih đei pơkă boih."
"And it was so. When he rose early the next morning and squeezed the fleece together, he wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowlful of water.","Tơdrong noh đei truh tơpă thoi noh; truh pơgê đơ̆ng rŏng Giđêôn iung đơ̆ng hrôih iŏk wĕnh akar sŏk triu, đơ̆ng tŭk jur na đei đak 'bĕnh kơ pơnhan."
"Then Gideon said to God, “Do not be angry with me, but let me speak just once more: Let me test, I pray, just once more with the fleece; let it now be dry only on the fleece, but on all the ground let there be dew.”","Giđêôn pơma dơnuh dơ̆ng hăm Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei: Apinh ih 'nĕ kơ hil mĭl kơ inh; ăn kơ inh pơma hăm Ih hơya pă minh wơ̆t đơ̆ng; ăn kơ inh pơlong lăng hăm akar sŏk triu pă minh wơ̆t đơ̆ng.

"And God did so that night. It was dry on the fleece only, but there was dew on all the ground.","Lăm măng noh, Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei pơm thoi noh. Minh drô̆ akar sŏk triu đĕch oei hrĕng kro, mă-lei teh tăp dăr đei tŭk đak ngom gom hơ-ih ngăl."
"Then Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and all the people who were with him rose early and encamped beside the well of Harod, so that the camp of the Midianites was on the north side of them by the hill of Moreh in the valley.","Lăp năr đơ̆ng rŏng, Jêrup Baal,a păng đĭ-đăng kon pơlei kiơ̆ sư iung đơ̆ng hrôih năm pơm bơsŭn oei pơdơh tơ tu đak Harôt lu bơngai Miđian pơm bơsŭn oei pơdơh tơ lăm thŭng gah yă-nơ̆m kơ lu sư jê̆ jơ̆ng groi Môre."
"And the LORD said to Gideon, “The people who are with you are too many for Me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel claim glory for itself against Me, saying, ‘My own hand has saved me.’","Kră Yang khan kơ Giđêôn: Lu bơngai kiơ̆ ih lơ dêh, dah Inh jao kon pơlei Miđian lăm ti lu sư; lei kơnh hli kơ bơngai Isơrael pơang khan: Nhôn kĕ jei đơ̆ng nhôn kơdih."
"Now therefore, proclaim in the hearing of the people, saying, ‘Whoever is fearful and afraid, let him turn and depart at once from Mount Gilead.’ ” And twenty-two thousand of the people returned, and ten thousand remained.","Thoi noh lei na ih roi bĕ kơ kon pơlei pơla khan: Bơngai bu hli tơtăm weh bĕ đơ̆ng kông Gileat na wih bĕ tơ hnam.

"But the LORD said to Gideon, “The people are still too many; bring them down to the water, and I will test them for you there. Then it will be, that of whom I say to you, ‘This one shall go with you,’ the same shall go with you; and of whomever I say to you, ‘This one shall not go with you,’ the same shall not go.”","Kră Yang khan kơ Giđêôn: “Kon pơlei kư̆m oei lơ dêh.

"So he brought the people down to the water. And the LORD said to Gideon, “Everyone who laps from the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, you shall set apart by himself; likewise everyone who gets down on his knees to drink.”","Thoi noh, Giđêôn chông ba kon pơlei jur nhă đak. Na Kră Yang khan kơ Giđêôn: Dah bơngai bu jur nhă liah păng hơpiĕt thoi kŏ, na lu bơngai noh ih lê̆ sư minh pah pha, bĕ lu bơngai bu jur nhă mă chhŏng đak hăm tơpang ti ih lê̆ lu sư pha."
"And the number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men; but all the rest of the people got down on their knees to drink water.","Đei lăp pêng-hrĕng 'nu bơngai, kŭp nhă chhŏng păng tơpang ti. Na dôm 'nu bơngai noh tă kơ nhă pơtăm kŭl-tăng ngăl."
"Then the LORD said to Gideon, “By the three hundred men who lapped I will save you, and deliver the Midianites into your hand. Let all the other people go, every man to his place.”","Kră Yang khan dơ̆ng kơ Giđêôn: Inh gô yua pêng-hrĕng 'nu bơngai mă nhă chhŏng hăm tơpang ti noh wă dŏng pơklaih lu iĕm, Inh wă jao kon pơlei Miđian lăm tơpang ti lu iĕm. Lu kon pơlei nai, ăn kơ lu sư brŏk tơ hnam."
"So the people took provisions and their trumpets in their hands. And he sent away all the rest of Israel, every man to his tent, and retained those three hundred men. Now the camp of Midian was below him in the valley.","Giđêôn ăn kơ lu bơngai Isơrael noh brŏk tơ anih bơsŭn lu sư kơdih.

"It happened on the same night that the LORD said to him, “Arise, go down against the camp, for I have delivered it into your hand.","Lăm măng noh Kră Yang khan kơ Giđêôn: Iung bĕ, năm jur blah bơngai Miđian, yua kơ Inh jao boih kon pơlei noh kơ iĕm."
"But if you are afraid to go down, go down to the camp with Purah your servant","Mă-lei tơdah ih hli kơ tơblah athei chông ba Phura đĭch đam ih kư̆m jur năm tơ noh."
"and you shall hear what they say; and afterward your hands shall be strengthened to go down against the camp.” Then he went down with Purah his servant to the outpost of the armed men who were in the camp.","Ih mơ̆ng lu sư pơma, na đei jơhngơ̆m nuih jur blah iŏk kơ kơđông lu sư. Thoi noh Giđêôn hăm Phura đĭch đam sư, năm jê̆ anih linh gak kơđông."
"Now the Midianites and Amalekites, all the people of the East, were lying in the valley as numerous as locusts; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the seashore in multitude.","Tơ noh kon pơlei Miđian, kon pơlei Amalek păng đĭ-đăng bơngai đơ̆ng gah hơlĕch nai oei tơ lăm thŭng lơlang lơlap nhen thoi lep tung-nut, lu aseh lăk-đa lu sư lơ ưh, kơ kĕ kơ jơ̆ nhen thoi pơlao chuơh tơter đak dơsĭ."
"And when Gideon had come, there was a man telling a dream to his companion. He said, “I have had a dream: To my surprise, a loaf of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian; it came to a tent and struck it so that it fell and overturned, and the tent collapsed.”","Kơplah Giđêôn truh, đei kơtơ̆ng minh 'nu bơngai roi kơ buăl sư khan: Măng 'nâu inh tep đei apo 'bôh minh pôm 'bĕng 'ba tơ'bâu apôm huŏng grŏl lăm kơđông linh Miđian.

"Then his companion answered and said, “This is nothing else but the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel! Into his hand God has delivered Midian and the whole camp.”","Buăl sư mơ̆ng hloi khan, tơpă noh đao gưm Giđêôn, kon drŏ-nglo Jôas, bơngai Isơrael.

"And so it was, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation, that he worshiped. He returned to the camp of Israel, and said, “Arise, for the LORD has delivered the camp of Midian into your hand.”","Lăp Giđêôn kơtơ̆ng roi kơ tơdrong apo păng kơtơ̆ng nơ̆r tơlang kơ tơdrong apo noh, na sư drap kơkuh kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei.

"Then he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet into every man’s hand, with empty pitchers, and torches inside the pitchers.","Sư klah asong pêng-hrĕng 'nu bơngai noh pơm pêng khŭl, sư asong ăn kơ rim 'nu bơngai linh chĕp tơgiĕp păng bơ̆i hoh lăm noh tah minh hơchô̆ hơpaih wă tơ̆k."
"And he said to them, “Look at me and do likewise; watch, and when I come to the edge of the camp you shall do as I do","Na Giđêôn pơkă khan: Iĕm lăng tơ inh, Inh pơm kiơ iĕm pơm kiơ̆ thoi inh; mưh inh năm tơ jê̆ kơđông ayăt, inh pơm thoi yơ lu iĕm pơm kiơ̆ thoi noh."
"When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then you also blow the trumpets on every side of the whole camp, and say, ‘The sword of the LORD and of Gideon!’ ”","Mưh inh păng lu bơngai kiơ̆ inh hlôm tơgiĕp, lu iĕm kư̆m hlôm tơgiĕp tơ tăp dăr kơđông Miđian păng jreo: Yua Kơ Kră Yang păng yua Kơ Giđêôn!"
"So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outpost of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, just as they had posted the watch; and they blew the trumpets and broke the pitchers that were in their hands.","Giđêôn păng minh-hrĕng 'nu bơngai kiơ̆ sư năm truh tơ anih linh gak kơđông; kơplah lu sư 'nao tơplih băl gak mă 'bar kơmăng.

"Then the three companies blew the trumpets and broke the pitchers—they held the torches in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands for blowing—and they cried, “The sword of the LORD and of Gideon!”","Pêng khŭl linh noh hlôm tơgiĕp păng teh pơchah bơ̆i tah ŭnh; ti gah 'ngiĕo lu sư yơ̆r chĕp ŭnh, ti gah 'ma lu sư chĕp tơgiĕp hlôm; na lu sư jreo khan: Toh đao bĕ.

"And every man stood in his place all around the camp; and the whole army ran and cried out and fled.","Lu sư dơ̆ng jum dăr kơ kơđông linh, bu 'bơ̆t yơ dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t ei. Na đĭ-đăng lu linh lăm kơđông Miđian kơdâu, lu sư ôr păng kơdâu ôn đĭ."
"When the three hundred blew the trumpets, the LORD set every man’s sword against his companion throughout the whole camp; and the army fled to Beth Acacia, toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel Meholah, by Tabbath.","Kơplah lu sư hlôm pêng-hrĕng tŏ tơgiĕp, Kră Yang pơm lu linh Miđian iŏk đao gưm 'bet pơlôch băl tơduă.

"And the men of Israel gathered together from Naphtali, Asher, and all Manasseh, and pursued the Midianites.","Lu bơngai Isơrael đơ̆ng adrĕch bơngai Naptali, Aser păng Manase pơpôi băl na druh 'moi pơlôch bơngai Miđian."
"Then Gideon sent messengers throughout all the mountains of Ephraim, saying, “Come down against the Midianites, and seize from them the watering places as far as Beth Barah and the Jordan.” Then all the men of Ephraim gathered together and seized the watering places as far as Beth Barah and the Jordan.","Giđêôn wơh bơngai năm tơ jơ̆p kơ groi kông Êphraim, na krao: Jur năm blah kon pơlei Miđian blah iŏk trong tơnŏk đơng lu sư juăt tŏk kơ đak Krong Jôrđăn, blah truh tơ pơlei Bêt Bara păng iŏk rok jih đak Krong Jôrđăn.

"And they captured two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the winepress of Zeeb. They pursued Midian and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side of the Jordan.","Lu sư đei rôp 'bar 'nu yŏng pơgơ̆r linh kon pơlei Miđian anăn bre sư Ôrep păng Sêep; lu sư pơlôch Ôrep tơ kơpal tơmo Ôrep păng lu sư pơlôch Sêep tơ anih đe hmĕt đak plei hơmu Sêep.

"Now the men of Ephraim said to him, “Why have you done this to us by not calling us when you went to fight with the Midianites?” And they reprimanded him sharply.","Bơngai Êphraim khan kơ Giđêôn: Yua kơ kiơ ih pơm kơ lu nhôn thoi noh? Liơ ih năm tơblah hăm bơngai Miđian mă ưh kơ krao nhôn? Lu sư chrih hil dêh kơ Giđêôn."
"So he said to them, “What have I done now in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?","Mă-lei Giđêôn khan kơ lu sư: Dôm tơdrong jang inh pơm hăm wă gơh pơting inh hăm lu iĕm?

"God has delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. And what was I able to do in comparison with you?” Then their anger toward him subsided when he said that.","Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei jao boih Ôrep păng Sêep 'bar 'nu yŏng pơgơ̆r Miđian, lăm ti lu iĕm; lei dôm tơdrong inh pơm boih hăm gơh pơting hăm lu iĕm?

"When Gideon came to the Jordan, he and the three hundred men who were with him crossed over, exhausted but still in pursuit.","Giđêôn hăm pêng-hrĕng 'nu bơngai kiơ̆ sư oei druh bơngai Miđian truh tơ đak Krong Jôrđăn păng tŏk tơ gah to kơ Krong Jôrđăn, lu sư mă gleh lap dêh ră."
"Then he said to the men of Succoth, “Please give loaves of bread to the people who follow me, for they are exhausted, and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.”","Giđêôn khan kơ bơngai pơlei Sukôt: Inh apinh iĕm asong bĕ 'bĕng hơya tŏ sĕt ăn kơ lu kon pơlei kiơ̆ inh; yua kơ lu sư gleh lap dêh; inh oei druh 'moi Sêba păng Salmuna, 'bar 'nu pơtao Miđian."
"And the leaders of Succoth said, “Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?”","Mă-lei lu 'bok pơgơ̆r pơlei Sukôt khan, ih tam đei rôp bre Sêba păng Salmuna ưh, na mă wă kơ lu nhôn asong ăn kơ lu linh ih 'bĕng sa."
"So Gideon said, “For this cause, when the LORD has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers!”","Giđêôn khan: Thoi noh dah Kră Yang pơjao Sêba păng Salmuna lăm ti inh, inh gô iŏk 'long jơla lăm char glă na raih hek lê̆ sĕch akar lu iĕm."
"Then he went up from there to Penuel and spoke to them in the same way. And the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered.","Đơ̆ng noh sư năm tơ pơlei Pênuêl kư̆m apinh lu sư. Kon pơlei Pênuêl tơl sư lei-lăi thoi bơngai pơlei Sukôt đei khan."
"So he also spoke to the men of Penuel, saying, “When I come back in peace, I will tear down this tower!”","Thoi noh sư khan kơ kon pơlei Pênuêl: Dah inh brŏk blah jei, inh gô pơrăm đĭ hnam thôt 'nâu."
"Now Zebah and Zalmunna were at Karkor, and their armies with them, about fifteen thousand, all who were left of all the army of the people of the East; for one hundred and twenty thousand men who drew the sword had fallen.","Sêba păng Salmuna oei tơ pơlei Karkơr hơdai hăm linh lu sư, dang mơjĭt-pơđăm rơbâu 'nu bơngai; noh đĭ-đăng lu bơngai mă oei arih lăm khŭl lu linh bơngai gah hơlĕch; yua kơ minh-hrĕng 'bar-jĭt rơbâu 'nu bơngai chĕp đao gưm đe pơlôch đĭ boih."
"Then Gideon went up by the road of those who dwell in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah; and he attacked the army while the camp felt secure.","Giđêôn tŏk 'moi kiơ̆ trong lu kon pơlei chă oei pơm bơsŭn pơdơh tơ gah hơlĕch kơ pơlei Nôba păng Jôbêha păng chă blah lu linh mă ưh kơ kơchăng."
"When Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued them; and he took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and routed the whole army.","Sêba păng Salmuna kơdâu ôn ră mă-lei Giđêôn rôp bre sư pơtao Miđian, lu linh sư kư̆m kơdâu đĭ."
"Then Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle, from the Ascent of Heres.","Giđêôn kon drŏ-nglo Jôas brŏk đơ̆ng anih tơblah rok trong kuĕl kông Hêres."
"And he caught a young man of the men of Succoth and interrogated him; and he wrote down for him the leaders of Succoth and its elders, seventy-seven men.","Sư đei rôp minh 'nu tơdăm kon pơlei Sukôt, na jet.

"Then he came to the men of Succoth and said, “Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you ridiculed me, saying, ‘Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your weary men?’ ”","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ noh Giđêôn năm tơ kon pơlei Sukôt na khan: 'Nâu boih Sêba păng Salmuna; yua kơ lu sư na mă lu iĕm pơjăm chrih kơ inh, khan: Ti ih tam rôp pơlôch Sêba păng Salmuna na wă kơ lu nhôn ăn kơ linh kiơ̆ ih gleh lap sa 'bĕng?"
"And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.","Thoi noh sư rôp teh pơmat lu kră lăm pơlei Sukôt hăm 'long jơla đơ̆ng char glă păng tơlei jơla."
"Then he tore down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city.","Sư kư̆m pơrăm hnam thôt pơlei Pênuêl păng pơlôch lu bơngai drŏ-nglo lăm pơlei noh."
"And he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, “What kind of men were they whom you killed at Tabor?” So they answered, “As you are, so were they; each one resembled the son of a king.”","Đơ̆ng noh sư apinh Sêba păng Salmuna: Măr iĕm pơlôch bơngai kiơ tơ Tabôr? Bre sư tơl; lu sư kư̆m hơbŏ thoi ih; rim 'nu lu sư kư̆m nhen thoi minh 'nu kon tơdăm pơtao."
"Then he said, “They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As the LORD lives, if you had let them live, I would not kill you.”","Na Giđêôn khan dơ̆ng: Lu sư 'nhŏng oh inh, kon tơdăm mĕ inh; tơpă, Kră Yang arih, tơdah măr iĕm lê̆ lu sư oei arih, lei inh ưh kơ pơlôch măr iĕm ôh!"
"And he said to Jether his firstborn, “Rise, kill them!” But the youth would not draw his sword; for he was afraid, because he was still a youth.","Đơ̆ng noh Giđêôn khan kơ Jêther, kon kơdră sư, iung pơlôch lê̆ bĕ măr sư. Mă-lei bơngai tơdăm noh ưh kơ toh đao gưm sư yua kơ sư hli; sư bơngai oei mơlôh."
"So Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Rise yourself, and kill us; for as a man is, so is his strength.” So Gideon arose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescent ornaments that were on their camels’ necks.","Sêba păng Salmuna khan: Iung bĕ; ih kơdih pơlôch nhi yua kơ bơngai liơ đei jơhngơ̆m pran thoi noh.

"Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, “Rule over us, both you and your son, and your grandson also; for you have delivered us from the hand of Midian.”","Na bơngai Isơrael khan kơ Giđêôn: Apinh ih kon drŏ-nglo ih păng lu sâu ih pơgơ̆r lu nhôn, yua kơ ih dŏng pơklaih lu nhôn đơ̆ng bơngai Miđian."
"But Gideon said to them, “I will not rule over you, nor shall my son rule over you; the LORD shall rule over you.”","Giđêôn tơl lu sư; Inh ưh kơ pơgơ̆r lu iĕm kon drŏ-nglo inh kư̆m ưh kơ pơgơ̆r lu iĕm mơ̆n; Kră Yang gô pơgơ̆r lu iĕm."
"Then Gideon said to them, “I would like to make a request of you, that each of you would give me the earrings from his plunder.” For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.","Giđêôn khan đơ̆ng kơ lu sư: “Inh wă apinh lu iĕm. Rim 'nu kơ lu iĕm athei ăn kơ inh dôm lu gŏp maih mă đêl lu iĕm blah iŏk.”a"
"So they answered, “We will gladly give them.” And they spread out a garment, and each man threw into it the earrings from his plunder.","Lu sư tơl: Lu nhôn hiôk gô ăn kơ ih lu tơmam noh. Lu sư lơ̆k ao, na đĭ-đăng lu bơngai drŏ-nglo dan gŏp maih đêl lu sư blah iŏk."
"Now the weight of the gold earrings that he requested was one thousand seven hundred shekels of gold, besides the crescent ornaments, pendants, and purple robes which were on the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that were around their camels’ necks.","Lu gŏp maih mă Giđêôn apinh noh kŏng lăng trăp đei mơjĭt-tơsĭn kĭ minh puăt maih, ưh kơ jơ̆ tơmam gĭt nai thoi rơbưn mă lu pơtao Miđian pơhrơp păng lu hơbĕn ao che 'brê hơhĭm juăt kơ hrŭk păng kư̆m ưh kơ jô̆ ôh maih tơmam 'măn lu sư tơ'băk tơ hơko aseh lăk-đa."
"Then Gideon made it into an ephod and set it up in his city, Ophrah. And all Israel played the harlot with it there. It became a snare to Gideon and to his house.","Giđêôn iŏk maih noh pơm ao tai êphot tah 'măn lê̆ lăm pơlei sư tơ Ophra. Đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael kơkuh kơ tơmam sư pơm noh; tơmam noh jing hơđong hơ'năk kơ Giđêôn păng hnam dơnŏ sư."
"Thus Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, so that they lifted their heads no more. And the country was quiet for forty years in the days of Gideon.","Lu bơngai Isơrael pơgŏ pơđep lu bơngai Miđian na lu sư ưh pă pơ̆n ngơk. Lăm chăl Giđêôn, dêh char sư pơdơh tơblah rơngei hiôk-hian lăm puăn-jĭt sơnăm."
"Then Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.","Jêrup Baal kon drŏ-nglo Jôas, wih brŏk oei tơ hnam sư kơdih."
"Gideon had seventy sons who were his own offspring, for he had many wives.","Giđêôn đei pơjing tơpơh-jĭt 'nu kon drŏ-nglo yua kơ sư đei akăn lơ."
"And his concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son, whose name he called Abimelech.","Akăn kơnhŏng sư oei tơ pơlei Sichem, kư̆m đei tơpŭ kơ sư minh 'nu kon drŏ-nglo, anăn sư Abimêlek."
"Now Gideon the son of Joash died at a good old age, and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.","Giđêôn, kon drŏ-nglo Jôas sơnăm đê̆ kră krŭng sư lôch đe 'bŭ sư lăm bơsat 'bă sư Jôas, tơ pơlei Ôphra, noh bơngai Abierit."
"So it was, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel again played the harlot with the Baals, and made Baal-Berith their god.","Lăp đơ̆ng rŏng kơ Giđêôn lôch, lu bơngai Isơrael wơ̆t pơm kơnê̆ dơ̆ng kơkuh kơ yang Baal; lu sư kơkuh kơ yang Baal Bêrit pơm yang lu sư."
"Thus the children of Israel did not remember the LORD their God, who had delivered them from the hands of all their enemies on every side","Lu bơngai Isơrael ưh pă 'blŏk boih kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu sư, Tơ'ngla mă dŏng pơklaih lu sư đơ̆ng ti lu bơngai ayăt jum dăr kơ lu sư."
"nor did they show kindness to the house of Jerubbaal (Gideon) in accordance with the good he had done for Israel.","Lu sư kư̆m ưh kơ đei jơhngơ̆m 'lơ̆ng tŏ sĕt hăm hnam Jêrup Baal noh Giđêôn, wă 'mong kơ dôm tơdrong hiôk 'lơ̆ng mă sư đei pơm boih kơ bơngai Isơrael."
"Then Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem, to his mother’s brothers, and spoke with them and with all the family of the house of his mother’s father, saying","Abimêlek kon drŏ-nglo Jêrup Baal năm tơ pơlei Sichem năm tơ lu adrĕch adrung gah mĕ sư păng đĭ hnam dơnŏ gah mĕ sư na khan"
"“Please speak in the hearing of all the men of Shechem: ‘Which is better for you, that all seventy of the sons of Jerubbaal reign over you, or that one reign over you?’ Remember that I am your own flesh and bone.”","Iĕm athei apinh lăng đĭ lu bơngai pơgơ̆r pơlei Sichem, na khan: Hơyơ tơdrong mă 'lơ̆ng hloh kơ iĕm: Tơpơh mơjĭt 'nu kon drŏ-nglo Jêrup Baal pơgơ̆r lu iĕm dah iŏk lăp minh 'nu đĕch pơm pơtao lu iĕm? Kŭm athei 'blŏk inh âu adrĕch akâu akar lu iĕm."
"And his mother’s brothers spoke all these words concerning him in the hearing of all the men of Shechem; and their heart was inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, “He is our brother.”","Lu 'nhŏng oh adrĕch adrung gah mĕ sư, pơma hơlơ̆k nơ̆r 'nâu wă kơ tơgŭm sư 'bơ̆t anăp lu bơngai pơlei Sichem, lăm jơhngơ̆m lu sư grê gah Abimêlek lăp đon kiơ̆ sư, yua kơ lu sư khan: Bơngai 'nâu 'nhŏng oh bơ̆n."
"So they gave him seventy shekels of silver from the temple of Baal-Berith, with which Abimelech hired worthless and reckless men; and they followed him.","Lu sư ăn kơ Abimêlek tơpơh-jĭt hlak hu iŏk đơ̆ng lăm hnam yang Baal Bêrit; Abimêlek iŏk jên noh chă apah kơ lu bơngai răm-'băm pơm kư̆ kă kiơ̆ sư."
"Then he went to his father’s house at Ophrah and killed his brothers, the seventy sons of Jerubbaal, on one stone. But Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left, because he hid himself.","Na Sư brŏk tơ hnam 'bă sư tơ pơlei Ôphra pơlôch 'nhŏng oh sư kơdih lu kon drŏ-nglo Jêrup Baal, tơpơh-jĭt 'nu tơ kơpal tơmo.

"And all the men of Shechem gathered together, all of Beth Millo, and they went and made Abimelech king beside the terebinth tree at the pillar that was in Shechem.","Đĭ-đăng bơngai lăm pơlei Sichem păng Bêt Milô, pơgơ̆p hơdai băl 'bơ̆t tơnơm 'long kôih păng gơ̆ng tơmo tơ pơlei Sichem, na pơk ăn kơ Abimêlek pơm pơtao."
"Now when they told Jotham, he went and stood on top of Mount Gerizim, and lifted his voice and cried out. And he said to them: “Listen to me, you men of Shechem, That God may listen to you!","Jôtham kơtơ̆ng tơdrong noh na năm tŏk tơ kơpal kông Gêrasim ôr pơret khan: Ơ lu bơngai lăm pơlei Sichem, mơ̆ng bĕ inh, na Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei gô mơ̆ng lu iĕm!"
"“The trees once went forth to anoint a king over them. And they said to the olive tree, ‘Reign over us!’","Lu tơnơm 'long akŭm hơdai băl wă tuh đak pơgang 'bâu phu kơ minh 'nu pơm pơtao pơgơ̆r lu sư. Lu sư khan kơ 'long ôliwơ: Pơgơ̆r bĕ lu nhôn."

"“Then the trees said to the fig tree, ‘You come and reign over us!’","Lu tơm 'long năm khan kơ tơm 'long hơra: Năm pơgơ̆r lu nhôn bĕ."
"But the fig tree said to them, ‘Should I cease my sweetness and my good fruit, And go to sway over trees?’","Mă-lei 'long hơra tơl khan: Inh gô hŭt lê̆ plei 'ngam 'lơ̆ng inh na năm chă hơtŭt 'bơm pơgơ̆r lu tơm 'long hă?"

"“Then all the trees said to the bramble, ‘You come and reign over us!’","Lu 'long pơle năm kơ 'long jơla: Năm bĕ pơgơ̆r lu nhôn."
"And the bramble said to the trees, ‘If in truth you anoint me as king over you, Then come and take shelter in my shade; But if not, let fire come out of the bramble And devour the cedars of Lebanon!’","'Long jơla tơl: Dah jơhngơ̆m iĕm wă tơpă na lu iĕm tuh đak pơgang 'bâu phu kơ inh pơk inh pơm pơtao pơgơ̆r iĕm, năm kơ'nơp bĕ ala yơ̆p inh; dah ưh, ŭnh đơ̆ng 'long jơla lĕch soh sa đĭ 'long hơngo char Liban!"
"“Now therefore, if you have acted in truth and sincerity in making Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him as he deserves","Thoi noh tơdah Lu iĕm đei jơhngơ̆m tơpăt păng pơyom wă kơ Abimêlek pơm pơtao iĕm păng tơdah lu iĕm pơm 'lơ̆ng hăm Jêrup Baal hăm hnam dơnŏ sư hăm đei pơm tơwih ăn 'lơ̆ng kơ đêl dôm tơdrong sư pơm."

"After Abimelech had reigned over Israel three years","Abimêlek pơgơ̆r lu bơngai Isơrael pêng sơnăm."
"God sent a spirit of ill will between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech","Na Kră Yang ăn yang kơnê̆ pơm kơ Abimêlek păng kon pơlei Sichem; lu pơlei Sichem areh ayăt kơ Abimêlek."
"that the crime done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might be settled and their blood be laid on Abimelech their brother, who killed them, and on the men of Shechem, who aided him in the killing of his brothers.","Tơdrong kơnê̆ 'nâu wă pơm plơ̆ đêl tơdrong yoch sư pơlôch tơpơh-jĭt 'nu kon drŏ-nglo Jêrup Baal păng pham tuh kơ Abimêlek hăm bơngai mă đêl pơlôch lu 'nhŏng oh sư păng kư̆m tuh kơ lu bơngai pơlei Sichem lu bơngai mă đei tơgŭm Abimêlek mă pơlôch 'nhŏng oh sư kơdih."
"And the men of Shechem set men in ambush against him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all who passed by them along that way; and it was told Abimelech.","Lu kon pơlei Sichem răp tơgar tơ rok kuĕl lu sư tơgar iŏk tơmam lu bơngai năm trong lu noh. Na đe roi ăn Abimêlek băt kơ tơdrong noh."
"Now Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers and went over to Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.","Kơplah Gaal kon drŏ-nglo Êbêt năm hơdai hăm 'nhŏng oh sư oei tơ pơlei Sichem. Lu bơngai lăm pơlei Sichem đei jơhngơ̆m lui gơnang kơ sư."
"So they went out into the fields, and gathered grapes from their vineyards and trod them, and made merry. And they went into the house of their god, and ate and drank, and cursed Abimelech.","Na lu sư năm tơ mir phĕ plei 'long hơmu chơpĕt iŏk đak hơmu wă et sa. Lu sư mơ̆t lăm hnam yang lu sư, et sa tih na pơma kơnê̆ pơjăm Abimêlek."
"Then Gaal the son of Ebed said, “Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerubbaal, and is not Zebul his officer? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem; but why should we serve him?","Gaal kon drŏ-nglo Êbêt khan: Abimêlek sư bu? Sichem bơ̆n yă kiơ na lu bơ̆n bơwih bơwăn kơ sư? Hăm trŏ kơ sư kon drŏ-nglo Jêrup Baal? Sêbul hăm trŏ kơ bơngai kơiĕng sư ưh? Athei bơwih bơwăn kơ bơngai Hamôr, sư 'bă kơ bơngai Sichem; na liơ bơ̆n bơwih bơwăn kơ lu Abimêlek hai?"
"If only this people were under my authority! Then I would remove Abimelech.” So he said to Abimelech, “Increase your army and come out!”","Ô tơdah kon pơlei pơla 'nâu lăm ti inh pơgơ̆r, lei inh gô pơpuh lê̆ Abimêlek hloi; inh gô khan kơ Abimêlek, ‘krao bĕ đĭ linh ih năm tơ âu!’"
"When Zebul, the ruler of the city, heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was aroused.","Sêbul bơngai yŏng wei pơlei kơtơ̆ng nơ̆r Gaal kon drŏ-nglo Êbêt pơma, na sư blĕk dêh"
"And he sent messengers to Abimelech secretly, saying, “Take note! Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem; and here they are, fortifying the city against you.","Na sư wơh bơngai năm truh tơ Abimêlek, tơ Aruma na khan: Gaal kon drŏ-nglo Êbêt păng lu 'nhŏng sư năm oei tơ pơlei Sichem sư pơhlŭ lu kon pơlei wă blah ih."
"Now therefore, get up by night, you and the people who are with you, and lie in wait in the field.","Yua kơ thoi noh, măng âu ih păng lu bơngai drŏ-nglo kiơ̆ ih iung bĕ năm chă răp lu sư tơ lăm bri."
"And it shall be, as soon as the sun is up in the morning, that you shall rise early and rush upon the city; and when he and the people who are with him come out against you, you may then do to them as you find opportunity.”","Truh pơgê dơning lăp 'năr 'nao wă lĕch, iung mơ̆t blah lăm pơlei. Dah Gaal păng lu linh kiơ̆ sư năm blah ih, na ih wă pơm kơ lu sư liơ mơ̆ng kơ ih."
"So Abimelech and all the people who were with him rose by night, and lay in wait against Shechem in four companies.","Thoi noh Abimêlek păng lu linh kiơ̆ sư iung oei kơmăng, klah asong puăn khŭl năm truh tơ pơlei Sichem păng năm răp tơ jih."
"When Gaal the son of Ebed went out and stood in the entrance to the city gate, Abimelech and the people who were with him rose from lying in wait.","Gaal kon drŏ-nglo Êbêt năm dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t 'măng dur pơlei; Abimêlek păng khŭl linh kiơ̆ sư weh đơ̆ng anih lu sư răp."
"And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, “Look, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains!” But Zebul said to him, “You see the shadows of the mountains as if they were men.”","Gaal 'bôh lu linh noh, na khan kơ Sêbul: Inh 'bôh đei khŭl linh jur đơ̆ng kông, Sêbul tơl: Ih 'bôh ngôi yơ̆p kông na ngeh kơ bơngai!"
"So Gaal spoke again and said, “See, people are coming down from the center of the land, and another company is coming from the Diviners’ Terebinth Tree.”","Mă-lei Gaal khan dơ̆ng: Inh 'bôh tơpă to lu linh jur đơ̆ng kông păng đei minh khŭl năm đơ̆ng 'long kôih lu bơngai tơwir."
"Then Zebul said to him, “Where indeed is your mouth now, with which you said, ‘Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him?’ Are not these the people whom you despised? Go out, if you will, and fight with them now.”","Na Sêbul khan kơ sư tơ yơ nơ̆r ih pơma pơang khan: Abimêlek sư bu mă lu bơ̆n athei chu bơ̆jang kơ sư? Noh hăm trŏ kơ lu bơngai mă ih pơjăm? Dang ei năm tơblah hăm lu sư bĕ!"
"So Gaal went out, leading the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.","Gaal năm dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp lu kon pơlei Sichem păng năm tơblah hăm Abimêlek."
"And Abimelech chased him, and he fled from him; and many fell wounded, to the very entrance of the gate.","Abimêlek năm druh blah Gaal; Gaal kơdâu hloi đơ̆ng anăp sư păng lơ bơngai pơ̆k lôch rok trong, truh tơ 'măng dur pơlei."
"Then Abimelech dwelt at Arumah, and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brothers, so that they would not dwell in Shechem.","Abimêlek năm oei tơ Aruma. Na Sêbul druh Gaal păng 'nhŏng oh sư lĕch đơ̆ng pơlei Sichem."
"And it came about on the next day that the people went out into the field, and they told Abimelech.","Năr đơ̆ng rŏng, lu kon pơlei Sichem năm lĕch tơ bri, na đei bơngai roi kơ Abimêlek băt."
"So he took his people, divided them into three companies, and lay in wait in the field. And he looked, and there were the people, coming out of the city; and he rose against them and attacked them.","Na sư krao klah asong lu linh sư pơm pêng khŭl, wă năm răp tơ bri. Lu sư lăng 'bôh lu kon pơlei lĕch đơ̆ng pơlei, na lu sư iung năm wang blah pơlôch lu đe noh."
"Then Abimelech and the company that was with him rushed forward and stood at the entrance of the gate of the city; and the other two companies rushed upon all who were in the fields and killed them.","Abimêlek păng lu linh kiơ̆ sư năm truh tơ 'măng dur pơlei; na 'bar khŭl nai druh rôp păng pơlôch đĭ linh mă oei tơ bri noh."
"So Abimelech fought against the city all that day; he took the city and killed the people who were in it; and he demolished the city and sowed it with salt.","Abimêlek blah kon pơlei noh prăt năr, blah iŏk jei păng pơlôch đĭ lu bơngai oei lăm pơlei noh, na teh pơchah pơrăm đĭ pơlei păng săi 'boh jơ̆p-jang lăm pơlei noh."
"Now when all the men of the tower of Shechem had heard that, they entered the stronghold of the temple of the god Berith.","Kơplah lu kon pơlei oei lăm hnam thôt pơlei Sichem kơtơ̆ng thoi noh na lu sư mơ̆t tơ lăm kơđông kơjăp hnam yang El Bêrit."
"And it was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.","Đe roi ăn kơ Abimêlek băt lu kon pơlei oei lăm hnam thôt Sichem oei pơđâu băl lăm noh"
"Then Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people who were with him. And Abimelech took an ax in his hand and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it and laid it on his shoulder; then he said to the people who were with him, “What you have seen me do, make haste and do as I have done.”","Abimêlek tŏk tơ kông Salmôn, hăm lu linh kiơ̆ sư. Sư chĕp ba sung, sư koh lu dơng 'long, na tôi tơ hơngiĕng; na sư khan kơ lu linh kiơ̆ sư: “Lu iĕm hăm 'bôh inh pơm ưh? Jah pơm bĕ thoi inh pơm boih.”"
"So each of the people likewise cut down his own bough and followed Abimelech, put them against the stronghold, and set the stronghold on fire above them, so that all the people of the tower of Shechem died, about a thousand men and women.","Thoi noh rim 'nu koh iŏk dơng 'long, na năm kiơ̆ Abimêlek dan dơng 'long noh tơ jum dăr kơ kơđông, iŏk ŭnh soh.

"Then Abimelech went to Thebez, and he encamped against Thebez and took it.","Abimêlek năm truh tơ pơlei Thêbes wang blah iŏk."
"But there was a strong tower in the city, and all the men and women—all the people of the city—fled there and shut themselves in; then they went up to the top of the tower.","Mă-lei tŏk-bŏk pơlei noh đei minh pơm hnam thôt tih kơjăp; đĭ-đăng lu kon pơlei, drŏ-nglo drŏ-kăn, kơdâu mơ̆t ôn tơ lăm hnam thôt noh, tang đĭ 'măng, tŏk tơ kơpal hnam thôt noh."
"So Abimelech came as far as the tower and fought against it; and he drew near the door of the tower to burn it with fire.","Abimêlek năm truh tơ hnam thôt păng wă blah. Lei lăp sư năm jê̆ 'măng hnam thôt wă soh."
"But a certain woman dropped an upper millstone on Abimelech’s head and crushed his skull.","Na đei minh 'nu bơngai drŏ-kăn hơtat tơpăl đơ̆ng kơpal 'bơm kơ̆l Abimêlek pơchah hloi."
"Then he called quickly to the young man, his armorbearer, and said to him, “Draw your sword and kill me, lest men say of me, ‘A woman killed him.’ ” So his young man thrust him through, and he died.","Na sư krao bơngai chĕp khêl dao sư păng khan: Toh bĕ đao ih pơlôch inh, kơnh đe khan: Minh 'nu bơngai drŏ-kăn pơlôch sư! Thoi noh bơngai noh 'bet sư hloi na sư lôch."
"And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed, every man to his place.","Wă lu bơngai Isơrael 'bôh Abimêlek lôch boih na rim 'nu brŏk tơ hnam lu sư kơdih."
"Thus God repaid the wickedness of Abimelech, which he had done to his father by killing his seventy brothers.","Thoi noh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei pơm tơwih kơ Abimêlek yua kơ sư pơm kơnê̆ hăm 'bă sư, yua kơ sư pơlôch tơpơh-jĭt 'nu 'nhŏng oh sư kơdih."
"And all the evil of the men of Shechem God returned on their own heads, and on them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.","Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei kư̆m pơm tơwih kơ lu kon pơlei Sichem mơ̆n yua kơ dôm tơdrong kơnê̆ mă đêl lu sư pơm. Tơdrong Jôtham kon drŏ-nglo Jêrup Baal hiap đei truh tơ lu sư."
"After Abimelech there arose to save Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in the mountains of Ephraim.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ Abimêlek lôch, Tôla kon drŏ-nglo Pua sâu Đôđô, sư bơngai Isakar, iung dŏng pơklaih lu bơngai Isơrael.

"He judged Israel twenty-three years; and he died and was buried in Shamir.","Sư pơm 'bok sek tơlang kơ lu bơngai Isơrael lăm 'bar-jĭt pêng sơnăm; đơ̆ng noh sư lôch păng đe 'bŭ sư tơ pơlei Samir."
"After him arose Jair, a Gileadite; and he judged Israel twenty-two years.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ sư lôch đei Jair, bơngai Gileat, iung pơm 'bok sek tơlang lu bơngai Isơrael lăm 'bar-jĭt 'bar sơnăm."
"Now he had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkeys; they also had thirty towns, which are called “Havoth Jair” to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.","Sư đei pêng-jĭt 'nu kon drŏ-nglo hao pêng-jĭt tŏ aseh iĕ păng pơgơ̆r pêng-jĭt tŏ pơlei tơ lăm dêh Gileat.

"And Jair died and was buried in Camon.","Lăp Jair lôch na đe 'bŭ sư tơ pơlei Kamôn."
"Then the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served the Baals and the Ashtoreths, the gods of Syria, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the people of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines; and they forsook the LORD and did not serve Him.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ noh lu bơngai Isơrael pơm dơ̆ng tơdrong kơnê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang lu sư kơkuh kơ lu yang Baal lu yang Astarôt, lu yang bơngai Aram, lu yang bơngai Siđôn, lu yang bơngai Môap, lu yang bơngai Ammôn păng lu yang kon pơlei Philistin. Lu sư achăng lê̆ Kră Yang păng ưh kơ chu kiơ̆ Sư."
"So the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and He sold them into the hands of the Philistines and into the hands of the people of Ammon.","Kră Yang hil mĭl kơ lu bơngai Isơrael; na Kră Yang jao lu sư kơ lu bơngai Philistin păng lu bơngai Ammôn pơgơ̆r lu sư."
"From that year they harassed and oppressed the children of Israel for eighteen years—all the children of Israel who were on the other side of the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, in Gilead.","Iŏk đơ̆ng sơnăm noh, 'bar khŭl adrĕch 'nâu pơgŏ pơđep pơjuă bơhlơ̆r lu sư lăm mơjĭt-tơhngam sơnăm.

"Moreover the people of Ammon crossed over the Jordan to fight against Judah also, against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was severely distressed.","Kon pơlei Ammôn kư̆m tŏk kơ đak Krong Jôrđăn, năm blah lu bơngai Juđa, lu bơngai Bênjamin păng lu bơngai Êphraim; lu bơngai Isơrael đei tơdrong pơmat-tat tih tơpă."
"And the children of Israel cried out to the LORD, saying, “We have sinned against You, because we have both forsaken our God and served the Baals!”","'Nâu lu bơngai Isơrael krao apinh Kră Yang, na khan: Lu nhôn đei pơm yoch hăm Ih lu nhôn achăng lê̆ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu nhôn păng kơkuh kơ lu yang Baal."
"So the LORD said to the children of Israel, “Did I not deliver you from the Egyptians and from the Amorites and from the people of Ammon and from the Philistines?","Kră Yang khan kơ lu bơngai Isơrael: Hăm trŏ Inh dŏng pơklaih lu iĕm hlôi boih đơ̆ng dêh Êyiptơ, klaih đơ̆ng kon pơlei Amôrit, klaih đơ̆ng kon pơlei Ammôn păng klaih đơ̆ng kon pơlei Philistin leh ưh?"
"Also the Sidonians and Amalekites and Maonites oppressed you; and you cried out to Me, and I delivered you from their hand.","Kŭm pơklaih iĕm đơ̆ng lu kon pơlei Siđôn, kon pơlei Amalek păng kon pơlei Maôn pơjuă pơđep lu iĕm.

"Yet you have forsaken Me and served other gods. Therefore I will deliver you no more.","Mă-lei lu iĕm oei achăng lê̆ Inh, kơkuh kơ lu yang nai yua kơ noh na Inh ưh pă wă dŏng pơklaih lu iĕm dơ̆ng."
"“Go and cry out to the gods which you have chosen; let them deliver you in your time of distress.”","Năm krao chă bĕ lu yang mă iĕm rơih iŏk boih; lê̆ lu sư dŏng pơklaih lu iĕm mưh lu iĕm đei gleh pơmat-tat?"
"And the children of Israel said to the LORD, “We have sinned! Do to us whatever seems best to You; only deliver us this day, we pray.”","Kon pơlei Isơrael khan kơ Kră Yang: Lu nhôn pơm yoch boih. Apinh ih pơm bĕ kơ lu nhôn kiơ̆ Ih lăng trŏ, na apinh Ih dŏng pơklaih lu nhôn năr 'nâu!"
"So they put away the foreign gods from among them and served the LORD. And His soul could no longer endure the misery of Israel.","Lu sư hŭt lê̆ đĭ lu yang nai đêl lu sư kơkuh păng awih awăn chu kiơ̆ Kră Yang. Kră Yang Sư sơ'ngon dêh 'bôh lu bơngai Isơrael pơmat-tat."
"Then the people of Ammon gathered together and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled together and encamped in Mizpah.","Lu kon pơlei Ammôn akŭm băl pơm kơđông tơ dêh Gileat. Kon pơlei Isơrael kư̆m pơpôi băl, pơm kơđông tơ Mispa."
"And the people, the leaders of Gilead, said to one another, “Who is the man who will begin the fight against the people of Ammon? He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.”","Lu 'bok pơgơ̆r dêh Gileat tơpinh dih băl: Bơngai bu mă blŭng-a năm blah kon pơlei Ammôn, bơngai 'noh sư gô pơm yŏng tih hloh lăm dêh char Gileat."
"Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, but he was the son of a harlot; and Gilead begot Jephthah.","Jeptha, bơngai Gileat, sư bơngai nuih kơtang. Sư kon drŏ-nglo bơngai drŏ-kăn đi; 'bă sư bơngai Gileat."
"Gilead’s wife bore sons; and when his wife’s sons grew up, they drove Jephthah out, and said to him, “You shall have no inheritance in our father’s house, for you are the son of another woman.”","Akăn bơngai Gileat kư̆m tơpŭ kơ dôm 'nu kon drŏ-nglo nai.

"Then Jephthah fled from his brothers and dwelt in the land of Tob; and worthless men banded together with Jephthah and went out raiding with him.","Đơ̆ng noh Jeptha kơdâu jăk ataih đơ̆ng lu 'nhŏng oh sư, sư oei lăm tơring Tôp; tơ noh đei lu bơngai pơm kơchu, lu sư pơm jơhngơ̆m đon păng Jeptha"
"It came to pass after a time that the people of Ammon made war against Israel.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ 'noh kon pơlei Ammôn tơblah hăm lu bơngai Isơrael."
"And so it was, when the people of Ammon made war against Israel, that the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob.","Lu kră pơgơ̆r bơngai Isơrael đơ̆ng char Gileat năm tơ tơring Tôp năm iŏk Jeptha brŏk năm tơblah kon pơlei Ammôn."
"Then they said to Jephthah, “Come and be our commander, that we may fight against the people of Ammon.”","Lu sư khan kơ Jeptha: Ih wih brŏk bĕ pơm yŏng pơgơ̆r lu nhôn, wă kơ lu bơ̆n năm blah hăm kon pơlei Ammôn."
"So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “Did you not hate me, and expel me from my father’s house? Why have you come to me now when you are in distress?”","Jeptha khan kơ lu kră Gileat: Hăm trŏ kơ iĕm areh kơ inh puh tơweh lê̆ inh đơ̆ng hnam 'bă inh na dang ei wă lu iĕm đei tơdrong gleh pơmat truh, lu iĕm năm tơ inh?"
"And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “That is why we have turned again to you now, that you may go with us and fight against the people of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.”","Lu bơngai kră char Gileat khan kơ Jeptha: Lê̆ pă jơ̆ tơdrong so wă kơ apinh ih năm hơdai hăm lu nhôn blah kon pơlei Ammôn, na wă kơ ih pơm yŏng kơ đĭ-đăng kơ lu bơngai mă oei lăm dêh Gileat."
"So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “If you take me back home to fight against the people of Ammon, and the LORD delivers them to me, shall I be your head?”","Jeptha khan dơ̆ng: Tơdah lu iĕm krao inh brŏk năm blah lu kon pơlei Ammôn, na mưh Kră Yang pơjao lu sư lăm ti inh boih, lei na inh gô pơm yŏng pơgơ̆r lu iĕm."
"And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “The LORD will be a witness between us, if we do not do according to your words.”","Lu kră lăm char Gileat khan kơ Jeptha dơ̆ng: Lu nhôn gô pơm kiơ̆ thoi nơ̆r ih pơma; apinh Kră Yang pơm kơdranh kơ lu bơ̆n."
"Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and commander over them; and Jephthah spoke all his words before the LORD in Mizpah.","Thoi noh Jeptha năm hơdai hăm lu kră char Gileat.

"Now Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the people of Ammon, saying, “What do you have against me, that you have come to fight against me in my land?”","Na Jeptha wơh bơngai năm truh tơ pơtao kon pơlei Ammôn khan: Nhôn hăm ih đei tơdrong kiơ na ih mah năm wang tơblah iŏk char nhôn."
"And the king of the people of Ammon answered the messengers of Jephthah, “Because Israel took away my land when they came up out of Egypt, from the Arnon as far as the Jabbok, and to the Jordan. Now therefore, restore those lands peaceably.”","Pơtao kon pơlei Ammôn tơl lu bơngai mă đơ̆ng Jeptha wơh: 'Noh yua kơ đơ̆ng lu bơngai Isơrael lĕch đơ̆ng dêh char Êyiptơ sơ̆, lu sư blah tơgar iŏk dêh char inh iŏk đơ̆ng đak Krong Arnôn truh tơ đak Krong Jabôk păng truh tơ đak Krong Jôrđăn; thoi noh dang ei pơdrâu kơ nhôn dêh char 'noh mă 'lơ̆ng bĕ."
"So Jephthah again sent messengers to the king of the people of Ammon","Jeptha sư wơh dơ̆ng bơngai năm tơ pơtao Ammôn khan"
"and said to him, “Thus says Jephthah: ‘Israel did not take away the land of Moab, nor the land of the people of Ammon","Jeptha khan thoi âu: Lu bơngai Isơrael ưh kơ đei tơgar iŏk teh char Môap ôh, kư̆m ưh kơ đei tơgar iŏk dêh char Ammôn"
"for when Israel came up from Egypt, they walked through the wilderness as far as the Red Sea and came to Kadesh.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ lu bơngai Isơrael lĕch đơ̆ng dêh char Êyiptơ, lu sư năm rok trong tơmăn glă truh tơ đak dơsĭ 'Brê, đang kơ noh năm truh tơ pơlei Kades."
"Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, “Please let me pass through your land.” But the king of Edom would not heed. And in like manner they sent to the king of Moab, but he would not consent. So Israel remained in Kadesh.","Kơplah noh sơ̆ bơngai Isơrael sư kư̆m wơh lu bơngai năm tơ pơtao Eđôm, lu sư khan: Asong lu nhôn năm rok trong dêh char ih, mă-lei pơtao Eđôm ưh kơ đei ăn ôh.

"And they went along through the wilderness and bypassed the land of Edom and the land of Moab, came to the east side of the land of Moab, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon. But they did not enter the border of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab.","Đơ̆ng noh lu sư wơ̆t năm rok trong tơmăn glă, dăr kơ dêh Eđôm păng dêh Môap; đơ̆ng noh lu sư năm truh tơ gah hơlĕch kơ dêh char Môap, lu sư pơm anih oei pơdơh tơ gah to kơ đak Krong Arnôn.

"Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, “Please let us pass through your land into our place.”","Pơ̆ng 'noh bơngai Isơrael wơh lu bơngai năm tơ Sihôn, pơtao bơngai Amôrit, oei tơ pơlei Hesbôn khan kơ sư: Nhôn apinh ih asong lu nhôn năm rok trong lăm dêh char ih wă năm mơ̆t tơ dêh char lu nhôn."
"But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory. So Sihon gathered all his people together, encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.","Mă-lei pơtao Sihôn ưh kơ lui ngeh kơ lu bơngai Isơrael, na sư ưh kơ ăn lu bơngai Isơrael năm rok trong dêh char sư.

"And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they defeated them. Thus Israel gained possession of all the land of the Amorites, who inhabited that country.","Na Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu bơngai Isơrael pơjao, Sihôn păng đĭ-đăng lu linh sư lăm ti bơngai Isơrael; tơblah jei lu bơngai Isơrael, thoi noh na lu sư iŏk đĭ-đăng dêh char Amôrit hăm lu bơngai mă oei lăm char noh."
"They took possession of all the territory of the Amorites, from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan.","Iŏk đĭ dêh char kon pơlei Amôrit iŏk đơ̆ng đak Krong Arnôn truh tơ đak krong Jabôk, hăm đơ̆ng tơmăn glă dĭng truh tơ đak Krong Jôrđăn."
"‘And now the LORD God of Israel has dispossessed the Amorites from before His people Israel; should you then possess it?","Thoi noh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu bơngai Isơrael puh tơweh boih kon pơlei Amôrit 'bơ̆t anăp lu bơngai Isơrael kon pơlei pơla Sư; na liơ ih wă gơh pơdrâu iŏk dêh char noh đơ̆ng?"
"Will you not possess whatever Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whatever the LORD our God takes possession of before us, we will possess.","Hăm trŏ kơ ih đei iŏk kiơ mă đơ̆ng Kêmôs yang ih ăn kơ ih?

"And now, are you any better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever strive against Israel? Did he ever fight against them?","Ih hăm trŏ hơgei hloh kơ Balak kon drŏ-nglo Siôr pơtao Môap ưh? Sư hăm đei nuih pơm năr ayơ pơjah pơjăng dah tơhil tơblah hăm lu bơngai Isơrael ưh?"
"While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and its villages, in Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities along the banks of the Arnon, for three hundred years, why did you not recover them within that time?","Lăm pêng-hrĕng sơnăm mă lu bơngai Isơrael blah iŏk oei tơ pơlei Hesbôn păng lăm lu pơlei iĕ pơlei Arôe hăm lu pơlei iĕ sư păng đĭ-đăng pơlei oei tơter đak Krong Arnôn; liơ mă ih ưh kơ blah iŏk teh noh kơplah noh?"
"Therefore I have not sinned against you, but you wronged me by fighting against me. May the LORD, the Judge, render judgment this day between the children of Israel and the people of Ammon.’ ”","Inh ưh kơ đei pơm yoch hăm ih, mă-lei ih pơm glăi hăm inh, wă tơblah hăm inh.

"However, the king of the people of Ammon did not heed the words which Jephthah sent him.","Mă-lei pơtao Ammôn ưh kơ wă mơ̆ng nơ̆r lu bơngai mă đơ̆ng Jeptha wơh năm tơ sư."
"Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh, and passed through Mizpah of Gilead; and from Mizpah of Gilead he advanced toward the people of Ammon.","Kơplah noh Yang bơhngol 'lơ̆ng Kră Yang jur oei hăm Jeptha; sư năm hlôi kơ char Gileat păng char Manase, năm truh hloi tơ pơlei Mispa lăm char Gileat; đơ̆ng noh sư năm blah kon pơlei Ammôn."
"And Jephthah made a vow to the LORD, and said, “If You will indeed deliver the people of Ammon into my hands","Jeptha krao apinh pơkă hăm Kră Yang, khan: Tơdah Ih pơjao lu kon pơlei Ammôn lăm tơpang ti inh"
"then it will be that whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the people of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD’s, and I will offer it up as a burnt offering.”","mưh inh brŏk đơ̆ng tơblah hăm kon pơlei Ammôn jei inh, bơngai bu mă lĕch đơ̆ng 'măng hnam inh, sơng inh.

"So Jephthah advanced toward the people of Ammon to fight against them, and the LORD delivered them into his hands.","Đang kơ 'noh Jeptha năm truh tơ kon pơlei Ammôn tơblah hăm lu sư; Kră Yang pơjao lu kon pơlei Ammôn lăm tơpang ti sư."
"And he defeated them from Aroer as far as Minnith—twenty cities—and to Abel Keramim, with a very great slaughter. Thus the people of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.","Đơ̆ng noh Jeptha blah iŏk 'bar-jĭt tŏ pơlei, đơ̆ng pơlei Arôe truh tơ wă jê̆ pơlei Minit păng truh hloi tơ pơlei Abel Kêramim.

"When Jephthah came to his house at Mizpah, there was his daughter, coming out to meet him with timbrels and dancing; and she was his only child. Besides her he had neither son nor daughter.","Wă Jeptha brŏk tơ hnam sư tơ pơlei Mispa na đei kon adruh sư lĕch năm sơng sư, chĕp hơgơ̆r iĕ tap suang hloi.

"And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he tore his clothes, and said, “Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low! You are among those who trouble me! For I have given my word to the LORD, and I cannot go back on it.”","Lăp sư 'bôh kon drŏ-kăn sư, sư hek hloi ao păng khan: Ơ, ơ mŏ adruh, ih pơm kơ 'bă hơ'ngon dêh tơpă, kon pơm kơ jơhngơ̆m 'bă rŭng răng!

"So she said to him, “My father, if you have given your word to the LORD, do to me according to what has gone out of your mouth, because the LORD has avenged you of your enemies, the people of Ammon.”","Kon drŏ-kăn sư tơl, “Ơ 'bă, tơdah ih đei krao khan pơkă pơkăm boih hăm Kră Yang, apinh ih pơm bĕ kơ kon kiơ̆ thoi đơ̆ng nơ̆r ih pơkă pơkăm noh, yua kơ Kră Yang đei iung kơting ăn kơ lu bơngai ayăt kơ ih 'noh kon pơlei Ammôn.”"
"Then she said to her father, “Let this thing be done for me: let me alone for two months, that I may go and wander on the mountains and bewail my virginity, my friends and I.”","Kon drŏ-kăn sư khan kơ 'bă sư: Apinh 'bă drơ̆ng iŏk nơ̆r kon pơma âu: Wă kơ kon rơhơi jơhngơ̆m lăm 'bar khei, kon gô tŏk oei tơ kơpal kông hăm lu mŏ oh, buôl buăl kon nhơ̆m hmoi kơ kon oei adruh hơlai hơnĭl layơ gơh iŏk klo."
"So he said, “Go.” And he sent her away for two months; and she went with her friends, and bewailed her virginity on the mountains.","Jeptha tơl: Kon năm bĕ.

"And it was so at the end of two months that she returned to her father, and he carried out his vow with her which he had vowed. She knew no man. And it became a custom in Israel","Truh đĭ 'bar khei, sư wih wơ̆t brŏk tơ 'bă sư; đơ̆ng noh 'bă sư pơm kơ kon sư kiơ̆ kơ nơ̆r sư đei pơkă pơkăm boih.

"that the daughters of Israel went four days each year to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite.","Rim sơnăm rim 'nu kon drŏ-kăn Isơrael năm nhơ̆m hmoi kơ kon drŏ-kăn Jeptha, bơngai Gileat lăm puăn năr."
"Then the men of Ephraim gathered together, crossed over toward Zaphon, and said to Jephthah, “Why did you cross over to fight against the people of Ammon, and did not call us to go with you? We will burn your house down on you with fire!”","Lu bơngai Êphraim akŭm đĭ-đăng năm tŏk đak Krong truh tơ pơlei Saphôn năm khan kơ Jeptha: Yua kơ kiơ ih năm tơblah hăm kon pơlei Ammôn mă ưh kơ krao lu nhôn wang năm hơdai?

"And Jephthah said to them, “My people and I were in a great struggle with the people of Ammon; and when I called you, you did not deliver me out of their hands.","Jeptha tơl lu sư: Inh hăm kon pơlei inh đei pơjah băl tih dêh hăm lu kon pơlei Ammôn; mă inh krao lu iĕm dŏng tơgŭm, lu iĕm kư̆m ưh kơ dŏng pơklaih nhôn đơ̆ng ti lu sư."
"So when I saw that you would not deliver me, I took my life in my hands and crossed over against the people of Ammon; and the LORD delivered them into my hand. Why then have you come up to me this day to fight against me?”","'Bôh iĕm ưh kơ đei dŏng pơklaih inh ôh, na inh ăn akâu inh lôch năm blah kon pơlei Ammôn, na Kră Yang pơjao lu sư lăm tơpang ti inh. Thoi noh, liơ mă năr 'nâu lu iĕm năm truh tơ âu wă blah inh?"
"Now Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead and fought against Ephraim. And the men of Gilead defeated Ephraim, because they said, “You Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites and among the Manassites.”","Jeptha krao akŭm đĭ-đăng kon pơlei Gileat năm blah lu bơngai Êphraim jei kon pơlei Gileat.

"The Gileadites seized the fords of the Jordan before the Ephraimites arrived. And when any Ephraimite who escaped said, “Let me cross over,” the men of Gilead would say to him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” If he said, “No,”","Lu bơngai Gileat blah iŏk dôm tŏ anih tơnŏk đơ̆ng tŏk kơ đak Krong Jôrđăn wă brŏk tơ Êphraim, tơdah đei lu bơngai Êphraim apinh khan: Apinh ăn kơ inh tŏk tơ pah to, đei lu bơngai Gileat apinh sư: “Ih hăm trŏ bơngai đơ̆ng Êphraim ưh?” Dah bơngai noh tơl: “Ưh ôh.”"
"then they would say to him, “Then say, ‘Shibboleth’!” And he would say, “Sibboleth,” for he could not pronounce it right. Then they would take him and kill him at the fords of the Jordan. There fell at that time forty-two thousand Ephraimites.","Lu bơngai Gileat khan kơ sư: “Pơma bĕ nơ̆r Sibôlêt;” Sư pơma nơ̆r: “Sibôlêt,” sư pơma ưh kơ hơđăl: Na lu sư rôp pơlôch hloi sư tơ anih tơnŏk tŏk kơ đak Krong Jôrđăn.

"And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in among the cities of Gilead.","Jeptha pơm 'bok kră sek tơlang kơ lu bơngai Isơrael tơdrâu sơnăm; na sư lôch, đe 'bŭ sư lăm pơlei tơ dêh Gileat."
"After him, Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ Jeptha đei Ipsan đơ̆ng pơlei Betlehem pơm 'bok sek tơlang bơngai Isơrael."
"He had thirty sons. And he gave away thirty daughters in marriage, and brought in thirty daughters from elsewhere for his sons.

"Then Ibzan died and was buried at Bethlehem.","Đang đơ̆ng noh Ipsan lôch đe 'bŭ sư tơ pơlei Betlehem."
"After him, Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel. He judged Israel ten years.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ Ipsan đei Êlon, bơngai đơ̆ng Sebulun tơplih sư pơm 'bok sek tơlang lăm Isơrael lăm mơjĭt sơnăm."
"And Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried at Aijalon in the country of Zebulun.","Đang kơ noh Êlon, bơngai Sebulun lôch; đe 'bŭ sư tơ pơlei Aijalôn lăm char Sebulun."
"After him, Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ Êlon đei Apđôn kon drŏ-nglo Hilel bơngai đơ̆ng pơlei Pirathon tơplih sư pơm 'bok sek tơlang lăm Isơrael."
"He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy young donkeys. He judged Israel eight years.","Sư đei puăn-jĭt 'nu kon drŏ-nglo păng pêng-jĭt 'nu sâu drŏ-nglo mơ̆n; lu sư hao tơpơh-jĭt tŏ aseh iĕ. Sư pơm 'bok sek tơlang lăm Isơrael tơhngam sơnăm."
"Then Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mountains of the Amalekites.","Đang đơ̆ng rŏng kơ Apđôn, kon drŏ-nglo Hilel lôch; đe 'bŭ sư tơ pơlei Pirathon lăm dêh Êphraim, lăm char gah groi kông bơngai Amalek."
"Again the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines for forty years.","Kon pơlei Isơrael pơm kơnê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang dơ̆ng; yua kơ thoi noh na Kră Yang pơjao lu sư lăm tơpang ti lu bơngai Philistin lăm puăn-jĭt sơnăm."
"Now there was a certain man from Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren and had no children.","Đei minh 'nu bơngai pơlei Sôra đơ̆ng lăm adrĕch adrung Đan, anăn sư Manôa. Akăn sư bơngai hơwŏng, ưh kơ đei kon."
"And the Angel of the LORD appeared to the woman and said to her, “Indeed now, you are barren and have borne no children, but you shall conceive and bear a son.","Linh jang 'lơ̆ng Kră Yang jur năm 'bơ̆t bơngai drŏ-kăn 'noh na khan: Ih bơngai hơwŏng ưh kơ đei kon, mă-lei ih gô anăp păng gô tơpŭ minh 'nu kon drŏ-nglo."
"Now therefore, please be careful not to drink wine or similar drink, and not to eat anything unclean.","Ih athei kơchăng, 'nĕ kơ huch sik đak hơmu dah tơmam kiơ suai păng kư̆m 'nĕ kơ sa tơmam kiơ mă ưh kơ rơgoh"
"For behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. And no razor shall come upon his head, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb; and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.”","yua kơ ih gô anăp păng tơpŭ kơ minh 'nu kon drŏ-nglo.

"So the woman came and told her husband, saying, “A Man of God came to me, and His countenance was like the countenance of the Angel of God, very awesome; but I did not ask Him where He was from, and He did not tell me His name.","Bơngai drŏ-kăn noh năm roi kơ klo sư: Đei minh 'nu bơngai đơ̆ng Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei năm tơ'bơ̆p inh, muh măt sư nhen akâu linh jang 'lơ̆ng Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei trŏ kơ hli krưp tơpă.

"And He said to me, ‘Behold, you shall conceive and bear a son.

"Then Manoah prayed to the LORD, and said, “O my Lord, please let the Man of God whom You sent come to us again and teach us what we shall do for the child who will be born.”","Manôa sư krao khan apinh Kră Yang: Ơ Kră Yang, inh apinh Ih ăn bơngai bu mă Ih wơh 'noh ki, năm dơ̆ng tơ lu nhôn wă kơ bơtho lu nhôn dôm tơdrong wă pơm liơ kơ kon wă tơpŭ tơ anăp âu kơnh."
"And God listened to the voice of Manoah, and the Angel of God came to the woman again as she was sitting in the field; but Manoah her husband was not with her.","Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei kơtơ̆ng nơ̆r krao khan đơ̆ng Manôa lei na linh jang 'lơ̆ng Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei năm tơ'bơ̆p dơ̆ng bơngai drŏ-kăn noh kơplah sư oei tơ mir; kơplah 'noh Manôa klo sư ưh kơ đei 'bôh hơdai hăm sư tơ noh."
"Then the woman ran in haste and told her husband, and said to him, “Look, the Man who came to me the other day has just now appeared to me!”","Sư kơdâu năm roi hloi kơ klo sư: Ih lăng to, bơngai mă jur tơ inh minh năr 'noh ki sư 'nao jur tơ'bơ̆p inh dơ̆ng."
"So Manoah arose and followed his wife. When he came to the Man, he said to Him, “Are You the Man who spoke to this woman?” And He said, “I am.”","Manôa iung, năm kiơ̆ akăn sư.

"Manoah said, “Now let Your words come to pass! What will be the boy’s rule of life, and his work?”","Manôa khan dơ̆ng: “Mưh nơ̆r Ih pơma trŏ 'blep thoi noh, lei tơdrong juăt kơ bơngai hơ'lơ̆p âu chă arih sa, jang sa liơ?”"
"So the Angel of the LORD said to Manoah, “Of all that I said to the woman let her be careful.","Linh jang 'lơ̆ng Kră Yang tơl tơwih kơ Manôa: “Bơngai drŏ-kăn âu athei kơchăng lăm dôm tơdrong mă đơ̆ng inh đei pơkă boih."
"She may not eat anything that comes from the vine, nor may she drink wine or similar drink, nor eat anything unclean. All that I commanded her let her observe.”","Sư ưh kơ gơh kơ sa tơmam kiơ đơ̆ng lăm pơgar hơmu, kư̆m 'nĕ kơ huch sik đak hơmu dah tơmam kiơ suai; kư̆m athei 'nĕ kơ sa tơmam kiơ mă ưh kơ rơgoh; sư athei răk dôm tơdrong mă inh pơkă kơ sư boih.”"
"Then Manoah said to the Angel of the LORD, “Please let us detain You, and we will prepare a young goat for You.”","Manôa apinh dơ̆ng linh jang 'lơ̆ng Kră Yang: Nhôn apinh gơ̆t ih oei 'bơ̆t âu wă kơ lu nhôn hơmet tơmam sa 'buh sa kon bơbe hăm ih."
"And the Angel of the LORD said to Manoah, “Though you detain Me, I will not eat your food. But if you offer a burnt offering, you must offer it to the LORD.” (For Manoah did not know He was the Angel of the LORD.)","Linh jang 'lơ̆ng đơ̆ng Kră Yang tơl Manôa.

"Then Manoah said to the Angel of the LORD, “What is Your name, that when Your words come to pass we may honor You?”","Manôa jet apinh jang 'lơ̆ng Kră Yang: Anăn Ih bu, wă kơ lu nhôn pơyom mưh nơ̆r ih khan âu trŏ 'blep?"
"And the Angel of the LORD said to him, “Why do you ask My name, seeing it is wonderful?”","Linh jang 'lơ̆ng Kră Yang khan: Liơ mă ih jet anăn inh, anăn inh jing hlĭch dêh."
"So Manoah took the young goat with the grain offering, and offered it upon the rock to the LORD. And He did a wondrous thing while Manoah and his wife looked on","Thoi noh Manôa rôp kon bơbe hăm tơpŭng na pơyơ̆r ăn kơ Kră Yang tơ kơpal tơmo.

"it happened as the flame went up toward heaven from the altar—the Angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar! When Manoah and his wife saw this, they fell on their faces to the ground.","Kơplah 'bơ̆t pla ŭnh đơ̆ng chơnang soi dơng tŏk tơ plĕnh, linh jang 'lơ̆ng Kră Yang kư̆m tŏk hơdai hăm pla ŭnh 'noh; 'bôh thoi noh Manôa păng akăn sư kŭp kơ̆l bon tơ teh."
"When the Angel of the LORD appeared no more to Manoah and his wife, then Manoah knew that He was the Angel of the LORD.","Wă linh jang 'lơ̆ng Kră Yang ưh pă đei jur đơ̆ng tơ Manôa hăm akăn sư na Manôa sư băt kơnăl 'noh linh jang 'lơ̆ng đơ̆ng Kră Yang."
"And Manoah said to his wife, “We shall surely die, because we have seen God!”","Sư pơma dơnuh hloi hăm akăn sư: Tơpă, băt ba gô lôch yua kơ ba 'bôh boih Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei!"
"But his wife said to him, “If the LORD had desired to kill us, He would not have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering from our hands, nor would He have shown us all these things, nor would He have told us such things as these at this time.”","Mă-lei akăn sư tơl: Tơdah Kră Yang wă pơlôch ba, lei Sư ưh kơ iŏk tơmam soi 'buh păng tơmam soi tơpŭng ba pơyơ̆r đơ̆ng tơpang ti ba, lei thoi kư̆m ưh kơ tơbăt kơ ba dôm tơdrong noh ôh, Sư ba đei kơtơ̆ng năr âu."
"So the woman bore a son and called his name Samson; and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.","Bơngai drŏ-kăn noh tơpŭ kơ minh 'nu kon drŏ-nglo, sư krao anăn Samsơn. Bơngai 'lơ̆p 'noh wơ̆ 'lŏ, Kră Yang ăn tơdrong pŭn hiôk kơ sư."
"And the Spirit of the LORD began to move upon him at Mahaneh Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.","Yang bơhngol 'lơ̆ng Kră Yang pơih ăn kơ jơhngơ̆m sư pran kơplah sư oei tơ lăm tơring Mahaneh Đan sơlam pơlei Sôra păng Êstaôl."
"Now Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines.","Samsơn jur năm truh tơ pơlei Timna. Tơ noh sư 'bôh minh 'nu adruh bơngai Philistin."
"So he went up and told his father and mother, saying, “I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines; now therefore, get her for me as a wife.”","Sư wih brŏk roi kơ mĕ 'bă sư: Kon đei 'bôh minh 'nu adruh bơngai Philistin lăm pơlei Timna; dang ei apinh iĕm rôp ăn adruh 'noh pơm akăn kon."
"Then his father and mother said to him, “Is there no woman among the daughters of your brethren, or among all my people, that you must go and get a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?” And Samson said to his father, “Get her for me, for she pleases me well.”","Mĕ 'bă sư tơl: Liơ ưh kơ đei ôh hă minh 'nu adruh lăm kon pơlei pơla bơ̆n, lăm adrĕch adrung bơ̆n, na mă kon khan wă chă akăn đơ̆ng kon pơlei bơngai Philistin lu sư ưh kơ đei kăt tơdra akar ôh.

"But his father and mother did not know that it was of the LORD—that He was seeking an occasion to move against the Philistines. For at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.","Mĕ 'bă sư ưh kơ băt ôh tơdrong 'noh lĕch đơ̆ng Kră Yang; wă chă tơdrong trŏ wă kơ sư pơm kơ kon pơlei Philistin, yua kơ kơplah 'noh lu bơngai Philistin oei pơgơ̆r lu bơngai Isơrael."
"So Samson went down to Timnah with his father and mother, and came to the vineyards of Timnah. Now to his surprise, a young lion came roaring against him.","Samsơn jur năm tơ pơlei Timna hơdai hăm mĕ 'bă sư. Lăp lu sư truh 'bơ̆t pơgar hơmu pơlei Timna 'bôh đei minh pơm kon dăm-brang grĕnh bruh châu Samsơn."
"And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he tore the lion apart as one would have torn apart a young goat, though he had nothing in his hand. But he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done.","Yang bơhngol 'lơ̆ng Kră Yang jur oei hơdai sư hăm tơdrong pran.

"Then he went down and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well.","Đơ̆ng noh sư jur năm pơma dơnuh hăm adruh; sư hưch kơ adruh ei tơpă."
"After some time, when he returned to get her, he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion. And behold, a swarm of bees and honey were in the carcass of the lion.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ 'noh đunh 'biơ̆, sư wơ̆t năm dơ̆ng wă iŏk oei kơ bơngai adruh 'noh; sư weh lăng đơ̆ng tơ dăm-brang lôch, 'bôh lăm kơting klak dăm-brang 'noh đei sal sut oei đei đak sut."
"He took some of it in his hands and went along, eating. When he came to his father and mother, he gave some to them, and they also ate. But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey out of the carcass of the lion.","Sư iŏk đak sut 'noh chĕp sa rah rok trong. Sư kư̆m ăn kơ mĕ 'bă sư sa. Mă-lei sư ưh kơ đei roi ăn kơ mĕ 'bă sư ôh sư iŏk đak sut 'noh đơ̆ng lăm kơting klak dăm-brang lôch."
"So his father went down to the woman. And Samson gave a feast there, for young men used to do so.","'Bă sư năm tơ hnam adruh 'noh, Samsơn hơmet tơmam sŏng sa, pơm rok thoi lu bơngai tơdăm oei akăn juăt kơ pơm."
"And it happened, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.","Lăp kon pơlei pơla 'bôh Samsơn, đe krao hloi pêng-jĭt 'nu bơngai tơdăm wă kơ pơgơ̆p pơm buăl juăt hăm sư."
"Then Samson said to them, “Let me pose a riddle to you. If you can correctly solve and explain it to me within the seven days of the feast, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing.","Samsơn khan kơ lu sư: Inh gô pơpơn lu iĕm minh tơdrong; lăm tơpơh năr đe pơm giĕng et sa pơkong tih, tơdah lu iĕm tơlang trŏ inh gô apah lu iĕm pêng-jĭt blah che brai se păng pêng-jĭt blah ao tai đe hrŭk pơguăng."
"But if you cannot explain it to me, then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing.” And they said to him, “Pose your riddle, that we may hear it.”","Tơdah lu iĕm ưh kơ gơh tơblang lei lu iĕm gô ăn kơ inh thoi tơ kơpal 'noh mơ̆n, lu sư tơl: Ih pơpơn bĕ ăn kơ lu nhôn mơ̆ng."
"So he said to them: “Out of the eater came something to eat, And out of the strong came something sweet.” Now for three days they could not explain the riddle.","Samsơn pơpơn.

"But it came to pass on the seventh day that they said to Samson’s wife, “Entice your husband, that he may explain the riddle to us, or else we will burn you and your father’s house with fire. Have you invited us in order to take what is ours? Is that not so?”","Truh năr mă puăn lu sư khan hăm akăn Samsơn: Ih athei pơlung klo ih athei sư roi ăn kơ bơ̆n tơlang nơ̆r pơpơn 'noh; tơdah ưh lu nhôn gô soh tŭt ih hăm hnam 'bă ih; hăm trŏ kơ ih krao pơtơm lu nhôn năm tơ âu wă tơpơ̆k lu nhôn 'bă?"
"Then Samson’s wife wept on him, and said, “You only hate me! You do not love me! You have posed a riddle to the sons of my people, but you have not explained it to me.” And he said to her, “Look, I have not explained it to my father or my mother; so should I explain it to you?”","Akăn Samsơn nhơ̆m 'bơ̆t sư, khan: Ih areh kơ inh, ih ưh kơ đei 'mêm kơ inh ôh.

"Now she had wept on him the seven days while their feast lasted. And it happened on the seventh day that he told her, because she pressed him so much. Then she explained the riddle to the sons of her people.","Lăm tơpơh năr et sa noh adruh 'noh nhơ̆m ling-lang 'bơ̆t sư; hlôi kơ tơpơh năr boih sư pă kĕ ĕnh sư tơlang ăn kơ akăn sư, yua kơ akăn sư nŏng lung sư.

"So the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down: “What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion?” And he said to them: “If you had not plowed with my heifer, You would not have solved my riddle!”","Truh đĭ tơpơh năr boih adrol kơ 'năr wă mơ̆t, lu bơngai tơdăm lăm kon pơlei năm khan kơ Samsơn na roi tơblang tơdrong pơpơn noh: Đei kiơ mă 'ngam hloh kơ đah sut?

"Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon him mightily, and he went down to Ashkelon and killed thirty of their men, took their apparel, and gave the changes of clothing to those who had explained the riddle. So his anger was aroused, and he went back up to his father’s house.","Kơplah 'noh yang bơhngol Kră Yang jur năm jur oei hăm sư lăm tơdrong pran.

"And Samson’s wife was given to his companion, who had been his best man.","Akăn Samsơn rôp oei kơ minh 'nu tơdăm, bơngai mă đe rơih pơm buăl juăt hăm sư năr sư oei."
"After a while, in the time of wheat harvest, it happened that Samson visited his wife with a young goat. And he said, “Let me go in to my wife, into her room.” But her father would not permit him to go in.","Đunh 'biơ̆ dơ̆ng 'noh, kơplah lăm bơyan yuă 'ba mi, Samsơn năm apong kơ akăn sư, chĕp ba minh pơm kon bơbe.

"Her father said, “I really thought that you thoroughly hated her; therefore I gave her to your companion. Is not her younger sister better than she? Please, take her instead.”","'Bă drŏ-kăn khan: Inh ngeh kơ ih areh ưh kơ wă kơ sư boih, na inh pơgơ̆p ăn kơ sư oei kơ buăl ih. Ih lăng oh drŏ-kăn sư hăm trŏ kơ 'lơ̆ng hloh kơ mŏ sư dah kiơ?

"And Samson said to them, “This time I shall be blameless regarding the Philistines if I harm them!”","Na Samsơn sư tơl lu sư: Tơdah inh đei pơrăm lu bơngai Philistin, pă minh 'măng âu inh ưh pă đei yoch boih."
"Then Samson went and caught three hundred foxes; and he took torches, turned the foxes tail to tail, and put a torch between each pair of tails.","Thoi noh Samsơn năm rôp pêng-hrĕng tŏ mơja sư iŏk hơchô̆ hơpaih 'long ŭnh lơ. Sư chô̆ kiĕng 'bar tŏ mơja grôi hơbĭ na chô̆ minh hơchô̆ hơpaih 'long ŭnh sơlam 'bar tŏ kiĕng mơja grôi."
"When he had set the torches on fire, he let the foxes go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burned up both the shocks and the standing grain, as well as the vineyards and olive groves.","Sư soh hơchô̆ 'long ŭnh na achăng lu mơja 'noh mơ̆t lăm mir 'ba mi kon pơlei Philistin; thoi noh ŭnh sa 'ba lu sư chô̆ boih păng sa hloi 'ba mi tam mă yuă, soh sa pơđĭ hloi pơgar 'long ôliwơ păng pơgar hơmu."
"Then the Philistines said, “Who has done this?” And they answered, “Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife and given her to his companion.” So the Philistines came up and burned her and her father with fire.","Kon pơlei Philistin khan: Bu pơm tơdrong 'nâu?

"Samson said to them, “Since you would do a thing like this, I will surely take revenge on you, and after that I will cease.”","Samsơn khan kơ lu sư: Đơ̆ng lu iĕm pơm thoi noh na inh kư̆m wă iung kơting pơm 'mong đơ̆ng kơ iĕm, mă keh 'mơ̆i na inh mă lê̆."
"So he attacked them hip and thigh with a great slaughter; then he went down and dwelt in the cleft of the rock of Etam.","Sư iung bruh păng teh pơlôch đei lơ bơngai, na Samsơn jur oei tơ lăm hơgơp tơmo lăm pơlei Êtam."
"Now the Philistines went up, encamped in Judah, and deployed themselves against Lehi.","Kon pơlei Philistin tŏk năm pơm kơđông tơ lăm char Juđa păng năm jơ̆p-jang truh tơ tơring Lêhi."
"And the men of Judah said, “Why have you come up against us?” So they answered, “We have come up to arrest Samson, to do to him as he has done to us.”","Lu bơngai Juđa jet lu sư: “Yua kơ kiơ lu iĕm tŏk blah lu nhôn?” Lu sư tơl: “Lu nhôn tŏk tơ âu wă rôp Samsơn.

"Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, “Do you not know that the Philistines rule over us? What is this you have done to us?” And he said to them, “As they did to me, so I have done to them.”","Na đei pêng-rơbâu 'nu lu bơngai Juđa jur tơ lăm hơgơp tơmo tơ pơlei Êtam khan kơ Samasơn: Ih ưh kơ băt hă kon pơlei Philistin boih pơgơ̆r lu bơ̆n?

"But they said to him, “We have come down to arrest you, that we may deliver you into the hand of the Philistines.” Then Samson said to them, “Swear to me that you will not kill me yourselves.”","Lu sư khan dơ̆ng: Lu nhôn jur tơ âu wă rôp chô̆ ih, wă ba ih tơ lu bơngai Philistin. Samsơn tơl: Apinh iĕm pơkă pơkăm hăm inh 'mơ̆i, iĕm ưh kơ pơlôch inh."
"So they spoke to him, saying, “No, but we will tie you securely and deliver you into their hand; but we will surely not kill you.” And they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock.","Lu sư tơl: Ưh ôh, lu nhôn lăp chô̆ ih, năm ba ih tơ lu sư đĕch, nhôn ưh kơ wă pơlôch ih ôh.

"When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting against him. Then the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him; and the ropes that were on his arms became like flax that is burned with fire, and his bonds broke loose from his hands.","Lăp lu sư truh tơ tơring Lêhi, kon pơlei Philistin lĕch tơ 'nguaih lu sư jreo ôr wă sơng iŏk Samsơn, na đei yang bơhngol Kră Yang jur oei hơdai sư hăm pơm kơ sư pran na tơlei giĕn đêl đe chô̆ ti sư 'noh nhen thoi brai ŭnh sa kơtĕch đĭ, hloi đơ̆ng ti sư."
"He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, reached out his hand and took it, and killed a thousand men with it.","Sư 'bôh kơting kang aseh iĕ bri 'nao lôch; sư dônh chĕp kơting kang aseh noh teh pơlôch minh-rơbâu 'nu bơngai Philistin."
"Then Samson said: “With the jawbone of a donkey, Heaps upon heaps, With the jawbone of a donkey I have slain a thousand men!”","Đang kơ 'noh Samsơn sư khan: Hăm minh pôm kơting kang aseh iĕ bri đĕch inh teh bơngai lôch lơ rơkhŭl rơkhăl măl; hăm minh pơm kơting kang aseh iĕ bri đĕch inh đei pơlôch boih minh-rơbâu 'nu bơngai."
"And so it was, when he had finished speaking, that he threw the jawbone from his hand, and called that place Ramath Lehi.","Lăp đang kơ sư pơma thoi noh, sư klơ̆m hŭt hloi kơting kang aseh iĕ bri 'noh; đe krao hloi anăn anih 'noh Ramat Lêhi.a"
"Then he became very thirsty; so he cried out to the LORD and said, “You have given this great deliverance by the hand of Your servant; and now shall I die of thirst and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?”","Yua kơ sư rơhing 'maih nhă đak dêh na sư krao apinh Kră Yang khan: “Ih ăn boih kơ đĭch đam ih tơdrong jơnei tih dêh âu, na dang ei inh wă lôch ngôi rơhing đak, na kư̆m wă huŏng 'bônh lăm ti lu bơngai ưh kơ chu kăt tơdra akar hă?”"
"So God split the hollow place that is in Lehi, and water came out, and he drank; and his spirit returned, and he revived. Therefore he called its name En Hakkore, which is in Lehi to this day.","Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ăn tơmo hơđang tơ lăm tơring Lêhi, na đei đak lĕch ro hloi: Samsơn đang kơ sư nhă lăm jơhngơ̆m sư 'brưk đei jơhngơ̆m pran dơ̆ng.

"And he judged Israel twenty years in the days of the Philistines.","Samsơn kơplah lăm chăl kon pơlei Philistin pơgơ̆r. Samsơn pơm 'bok sek tơlang kơ bơngai Isơrael lăm 'bar-jĭt sơnăm."
"Now Samson went to Gaza and saw a harlot there, and went in to her.","Samsơn năm tơ pơlei Gasa, 'bôh minh 'nu adruh đi tơ noh. Sư mơ̆t tep hloi lăm hnam adruh ei."
"When the Gazites were told, “Samson has come here!” they surrounded the place and lay in wait for him all night at the gate of the city. They were quiet all night, saying, “In the morning, when it is daylight, we will kill him.”","Lu kon pơlei Gasa: Chă tơroi dih băl Samsơn truh tơ âu boih.

"And Samson lay low till midnight; then he arose at midnight, took hold of the doors of the gate of the city and the two gateposts, pulled them up, bar and all, put them on his shoulders, and carried them to the top of the hill that faces Hebron.","Mă-lei Samsơn tep tơ noh truh tŏk-bŏk măng, sư iung, sư buch tôi ba tơ hơngiĕng sư hloi 'bar pah 'măng dur păng 'bar tŏ jrăng, chĕp ba tơ kơ̆l kông tơklă Hêbrôn."
"Afterward it happened that he loved a woman in the Valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ 'noh sư hưch kơ minh 'nu adruh lăm thŭng Sôrek, anăn sư Đelila."
"And the lords of the Philistines came up to her and said to her, “Entice him, and find out where his great strength lies, and by what means we may overpower him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and every one of us will give you eleven hundred pieces of silver.”","Lu yŏng pơgơ̆r bơngai Philistin năm tơ hnam adruh 'noh khan: Ih athei lung sư, wă kơ băt sư đei jơhngơ̆m pran tih dêh 'noh đơ̆ng yơ păng lu bơ̆n athei pơm thoi yơ wă kơ kĕ rôp chô̆ sư gơh chu kơ nhôn, na rim 'nu kơ lu nhôn gô apah ih mơjĭt-pêng kĭ jên hu."
"So Delilah said to Samson, “Please tell me where your great strength lies, and with what you may be bound to afflict you.”","Thoi noh Đelila khan kơ Samsơn: Apinh ih athei roi ăn kơ inh đơ̆ng yơ ih đei jơhngơ̆m pran tih dêh thoi noh, liơ gơh chô̆ ih, wă kơ kĕ pơm kơ ih chu."
"And Samson said to her, “If they bind me with seven fresh bowstrings, not yet dried, then I shall become weak, and be like any other man.”","Samsơn tơl sư: “Tơdah đe chô̆ inh hăm tơpơh dăng tơlei dơhiĕng oei hơdrih, lei inh rơdu lei-lăi nhen thoi lu bơngai nai.”"
"So the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven fresh bowstrings, not yet dried, and she bound him with them.","Thoi noh lu yŏng pơgơ̆r Philistin chĕp ba ăn kơ Đelila tơpơh dăng tơlei wă pơm dơhiĕng hră oei hơdrih, na drŏ-kăn ei chô̆ Samsơn."
"Now men were lying in wait, staying with her in the room. And she said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” But he broke the bowstrings as a strand of yarn breaks when it touches fire. So the secret of his strength was not known.","Na đei lu bơngai drŏ-nglo oei răp lăm hnam, drŏ-kăn ei krao: Ơ Samsơn, lu bơngai Philistin wă năm rôp ih.

"Then Delilah said to Samson, “Look, you have mocked me and told me lies. Now, please tell me what you may be bound with.”","Đelila khan kơ Samsơn: Ih roi hơlĕnh kơ inh boih, dang ei apinh ih roi ăn kơ inh mă tơpăt dang ei pơm liơ wă kơ gơh chô̆ ih?"
"So he said to her, “If they bind me securely with new ropes that have never been used, then I shall become weak, and be like any other man.”","Samsơn khan: Tơdah đe chô̆ gơhret inh hăm tơlei giĕn 'nao kŭi ưh tam đei bu yua, lei inh gô jing rơdu, nhen thoi lu bơngai nai đĕch."
"Therefore Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them, and said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” And men were lying in wait, staying in the room. But he broke them off his arms like a thread.","Thoi noh Đelila iŏk tơlei giĕn 'nao kŭi tam đei bu yua chô̆ Samsơn sư krao: Ơ Samsơn, lu bơngai Philistin wă blah rôp ih!

"Delilah said to Samson, “Until now you have mocked me and told me lies. Tell me what you may be bound with.” And he said to her, “If you weave the seven locks of my head into the web of the loom”","Đelila khan Ih oei roi hơlĕnh kơ inh dơ̆ng; apinh ih roi ăn kơ inh băl.

"So she wove it tightly with the batten of the loom, and said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” But he awoke from his sleep, and pulled out the batten and the web from the loom.","Đelila gô Samsơn tep iŏk tơpơh dăng 'monh sŏk Samsơn tanh kơjăp hơdai hăm 'long wai; đang kơ 'noh sư krao: Ơ Samsơn bơngai Philistin wă blah rôp ih, mă-lei sư iung râp hloi 'long wai hăm pơdŭng kơtĕch hloi brai mă tanh hăm sŏk."
"Then she said to him, “How can you say, ‘I love you,’ when your heart is not with me? You have mocked me these three times, and have not told me where your great strength lies.”","Na Đelila khan kơ Samsơn: Liơ mă ih khan, Inh hưch kơ ih, mă-lei lăm jơhngơ̆m ih ưh kơ tơpăt hăm inh Ih hơlĕnh kơ inh pêng wơ̆t kơ 'nâu boih, ưh kơ roi hơlăng tơpăt kơ inh jơhngơ̆m pran kơtang ih tih dêh 'noh đei đơ̆ng yơ."
"And it came to pass, when she pestered him daily with her words and pressed him, so that his soul was vexed to death","Rim năr hrăn lung pơm kơ Samsơn ưh kơ hiôk rŏ kơ 'maih lôch."
"that he told her all his heart, and said to her, “No razor has ever come upon my head, for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother’s womb. If I am shaven, then my strength will leave me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.”","Na sư roi tơpăt đĭ-đăng tơdrong.

"When Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, “Come up once more, for he has told me all his heart.” So the lords of the Philistines came up to her and brought the money in their hand.","Đelila 'bôh Samsơn roi đĭ jơhngơ̆m tơpăt kơ sư boih, sư krao lu 'bok pơgơ̆r bơngai Philistin sư khan: Pă minh 'măng âu, iĕm năm tơ âu bĕ yua kơ sư roi tơpăt đĭ tơm tơdrong ăn kơ inh.

"Then she lulled him to sleep on her knees, and called for a man and had him shave off the seven locks of his head. Then she began to torment him, and his strength left him.","Drŏ-kăn ei pơlung Samsơn tep hơgơn 'bơ̆t blu sư, krao bơngai hơkôih lê̆ tơpơh dăng 'monh sŏk đơ̆ng kơ̆l Samsơn; drŏ-kăn âu pơm kơ Samsơn gleh lap, tơdrong pran sư lĕch đơ̆ng lăm jơhngơ̆m sư."
"And she said, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” So he awoke from his sleep, and said, “I will go out as before, at other times, and shake myself free!” But he did not know that the LORD had departed from him.","Drŏ-kăn ei khan: Ơ Samsơn bơngai Philistin năm blah rôp ih.

"Then the Philistines took him and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza.

"However, the hair of his head began to grow again after it had been shaven.","Lu sŏk sư đơ̆ng đe hơkôih bluh dơ̆ng boih."
"Now the lords of the Philistines gathered together to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice.

"So it happened, when their hearts were merry, that they said, “Call for Samson, that he may perform for us.” So they called for Samson from the prison, and he performed for them. And they stationed him between the pillars.","Wă jơhngơ̆m lu sư hiôk chơt, lu sư ôr re khan: Hơtŏk Samsơn tơ âu bĕ, wă kơ sư pơpơm pơchơt kơ lu bơ̆n.

"Then Samson said to the lad who held him by the hand, “Let me feel the pillars which support the temple, so that I can lean on them.”","Samsơn khan kơ bơngai hơ'lơ̆p ba sư: Ba inh năm tơ jrăng tih mă pơjăng kơ hnam akŭm âu, wă kơ inh gơning kơ jrăng 'noh."
"Now the temple was full of men and women. All the lords of the Philistines were there—about three thousand men and women on the roof watching while Samson performed.","Lăm hnam 'noh đei lơ bơngai drŏ-nglo drŏ-kăn, 'lơ̆p 'lŏ; dôm lu yŏng pơgơ̆r bơngai Philistin ngôi đĭ tơ noh; tơ kơpal bơbŭng hnam noh đei dang pêng-rơbâu 'nu bơngai drŏ-nglo păng drŏ-kăn oei lăng Samsơn pơpơm pơchơt."
"Then Samson called to the LORD, saying, “O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray! Strengthen me, I pray, just this once, O God, that I may with one blow take vengeance on the Philistines for my two eyes!”","Samsơn krao khan: Ơ Kră Yang Tih Hloh, apinh Ih 'blŏk kơ inh.

"And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars which supported the temple, and he braced himself against them, one on his right and the other on his left.","Samsơn rôp kơjăp 'bar tŏ jrăng tơm dŏl hnam akŭm tih sư rôp kơjăp; ti gah 'ngiĕo sư rôp jrăng minh pơm; ti gah 'ma sư kư̆m rôp jrăng nai"
"Then Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines!” And he pushed with all his might, and the temple fell on the lords and all the people who were in it. So the dead that he killed at his death were more than he had killed in his life.","Sư khan thoi âu: “Apinh Ih ăn kơ inh lôch hơdai hăm lu kon pơlei bơngai Philistin!” Đơ̆ng noh sư tŭk đĭ jơhngơ̆m pran tŭn tơlơ̆ 'bar tŏ jrăng hơlih?

"And his brothers and all his father’s household came down and took him, and brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of his father Manoah. He had judged Israel twenty years.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ noh, 'nhŏng oh sư păng đĭ-đăng hnam dơnŏ 'bă sư jur tơ noh, iŏk ba atâu sư brŏk 'bŭ tơ lăm bơsat Manôa 'bă sư, sơlam pơlei Sôra hăm pơlei Êstaôl Samsơn pơm 'bok sek tơlang kơ lu bơngai Isơrael lăm 'bar-jĭt sơnăm."
"Now there was a man from the mountains of Ephraim, whose name was Micah.","Lăm groi kông Êphraim đei minh 'nu bơngai drŏ-nglo anăn sư Mika."
"And he said to his mother, “The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from you, and on which you put a curse, even saying it in my ears—here is the silver with me; I took it.” And his mother said, “May you be blessed by the LORD, my son!”","Sư khan kơ mĕ sư: Minh-rơbâu minh-hrĕng tơpei hu đe tơtông đơ̆ng ih; ih hiap bơngai bu iŏk jên liơ kư̆m bưh inh gô mơ̆ng; jên noh dang ei lăm ti inh, inh iŏk jên noh. Mĕ sư khan: Apinh Kră Yang tuh ăn tơdrong pŭn hiôk kơ kon dăm inh!"
"So when he had returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, “I had wholly dedicated the silver from my hand to the LORD for my son, to make a carved image and a molded image; now therefore, I will return it to you.”","Wă Mika pơdrâu kơ mĕ sư minh-rơbâu minh-hrĕng tơpei hu 'noh; mĕ sư khan: Hu 'nâu mĕ pơkă wă 'măn pha pơyơ̆r kơ Kră Yang hăm anăn kon man rup Yang păng tuh rup yang. Thoi noh mĕ pơdrâu ăn kơ kon hu 'noh dang ei."
"Thus he returned the silver to his mother. Then his mother took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to the silversmith, and he made it into a carved image and a molded image; and they were in the house of Micah.","Mika pơdrâu hu noh kơ mĕ sư; mĕ sư iŏk hloi 'bar-hrĕng hlak hu ăn kơ bơngai hling pơm rup yang na sư hling hloi rup yang; đe 'măn lê̆ lăm hnam Mika."
"The man Micah had a shrine, and made an ephod and household idols; and he consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.","Mika kư̆m pơm hnam kơkuh kơ yang; sư pơm minh blah ao êphot păng dôm tŏ yang; sư pơk ăn kơ kon drŏ-nglo sư pơm 'bok soi."
"In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes.","Kơplah 'noh ưh kơ đei bu pơm pơtao lăm Isơrael. Rim 'nu kư̆ kơ pơm kiơ̆ kơdih wă khan trŏ."
"Now there was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah, of the family of Judah; he was a Levite, and was staying there.","Đei minh 'nu tơdăm đơ̆ng pơlei Betlehem lăm dêh Juđa. Tơdăm âu tơpŭ kơ sư wơ̆ 'lŏ hăm kon pơlei Juđa."
"The man departed from the city of Bethlehem in Judah to stay wherever he could find a place. Then he came to the mountains of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.","Mă-lei sư lê̆ pơlei Betlehem lăm dêh char Juđa na năm chă jang sa tơ nai. Kơplah sư năm rok trong sư năm truh tơ groi kông Êphraim, weh ngôi tơ hnam Mika."
"And Micah said to him, “Where do you come from?” So he said to him, “I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I am on my way to find a place to stay.”","Mika apinh sư: Ih đơ̆ng yơ? Bơngai ei tơl: Inh bơngai Lêwi đơ̆ng pơlei Betlehem dêh Juđa, năm tơ âu wă chă anih oei jang sa."
"Micah said to him, “Dwell with me, and be a father and a priest to me, and I will give you ten shekels of silver per year, a suit of clothes, and your sustenance.” So the Levite went in.","Mika khan: Thoi ei Ih oei hăm inh, pơm 'bă păng 'bok soi inh. Na inh gô apah ih minh sơnăm mơjĭt tơpei hu, hơbĕn ao hrŭk, păng tơmam sa inh gô ăn kơ ih tơm mah."
"Then the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man became like one of his sons to him.","Na bơngai Lêwi sư lăp đon oei hơdai hăm Mika. Mika sư lăng bơngai 'lơ̆p 'noh nhen thoi kon drŏ-nglo sư kơdih."
"So Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and lived in the house of Micah.","Na Mika pơk ăn kơ bơngai Lêwi noh pơm 'bok soi sư păng sư oei hloi lăm hnam Mika."
"Then Micah said, “Now I know that the LORD will be good to me, since I have a Levite as priest!”","Mika khan: Dang ei inh băt boih kơ Kră Yang gô tơgŭm inh đei tơdrong pŭn hiôk, yua kơ bơngai Lêwi pơm 'bok soi inh boih."
"In those days there was no king in Israel. And in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking an inheritance for itself to dwell in; for until that day their inheritance among the tribes of Israel had not fallen to them.","Kơplah 'noh ưh kơ đei pơtao lăm dêh Isơrael, ưh kơ đei pơtao lu adrĕch Đan oei năm chă teh, anih oei jang sa, yua kơ đơ̆ng sơ̆ truh dang ei, lăm dôm lu adrĕch Isơrael, bơngai Đan âu ưh tam mă đei teh, anih jang sa 'bơ̆t yơ."
"So the children of Dan sent five men of their family from their territory, men of valor from Zorah and Eshtaol, to spy out the land and search it. They said to them, “Go, search the land.” So they went to the mountains of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there.","Thoi noh bơngai Đan rơih pơđăm 'nu lu bơngai nuih kơtang, năm đơ̆ng pơlei Sôra păng Êstaôl wơh chop lăng dêh 'noh.

"While they were at the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young Levite. They turned aside and said to him, “Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? What do you have here?”","Wă lu sư năm jê̆ tơ hnam Mika, kơtơ̆ng nơ̆r bơngai tơdăm Lêwi noh pơma, lu sư năm truh tơ noh jet: Bu chông ba ih năm tơ âu? Ih oei tơ âu pơm kiơ? Yua kơ kiơ ih oei tơ âu?"
"He said to them, “Thus and so Micah did for me. He has hired me, and I have become his priest.”","Bơngai Lêwi roi: Mika pơk inh jang, Mika apah inh, pơm 'bok soi ăn kơ sư."
"So they said to him, “Please inquire of God, that we may know whether the journey on which we go will be prosperous.”","Lu sư khan: Apinh ih krao khan bĕ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei, lu nhôn chă năm âu băt hăm đei ưh."
"And the priest said to them, “Go in peace. The presence of the LORD be with you on your way.”","'Bok soi ei tơl: Năm bĕ hiôk-hian, Kră Yang gô wei-lăng trong lu iĕm yak năm."
"So the five men departed and went to Laish. They saw the people who were there, how they dwelt safely, in the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and secure. There were no rulers in the land who might put them to shame for anything. They were far from the Sidonians, and they had no ties with anyone.","Pơđăm 'nu noh sư yak năm truh tơ pơlei Lais, lu sư 'bôh kon pơlei pơla tơ noh oei sa rơnŭk rơnua thoi lu kon pơlei Siđôn, oei hơđơ̆ng hiôk-hian păng oei jơnap lăm teh đak ưh kơ đei tơmam kiơ khăi? Lu sư oei ataih đơ̆ng pơlei Siđôn, kư̆m ưh kơ đei tơdrong kiơ hăm bơngai nai."
"Then the spies came back to their brethren at Zorah and Eshtaol, and their brethren said to them, “What is your report?”","Lăp lu pơđăm 'nu ei wơ̆t brŏk tơ pơlei Sôra păng pơlei Êstaôl; 'nhŏng oh lu sư apinh lu sư: “Lu iĕm chop lăng 'bôh liơ?”"
"So they said, “Arise, let us go up against them. For we have seen the land, and indeed it is very good. Would you do nothing? Do not hesitate to go, and enter to possess the land.","Lu sư tơl: “Bơ̆n athei năm blah lu sư, yua kơ lu nhôn 'bôh boih dêh char 'noh teh 'lơ̆ng. Ô! Lu iĕm năm truh tơ noh ưh kơ đei pơm kiơ hloi hă? Bơ̆n 'nĕ kơ hiơ̆, 'nĕ kơ hli bơ̆n dah blah iŏk teh 'noh."
"When you go, you will come to a secure people and a large land. For God has given it into your hands, a place where there is no lack of anything that is on the earth.”","Mưh lu iĕm năm truh tơ dêh noh lu iĕm gô 'bôh kon pơlei oei hơđơ̆ng rơnŭk rơnua. Dêh 'noh să păng sĭt Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei gô pơjao lăm ti bơ̆n, teh đak ưh kơ đei khăi minh tơmam kiơ.”"
"And six hundred men of the family of the Danites went from there, from Zorah and Eshtaol, armed with weapons of war.","Thoi noh đei tơdrâu-hrĕng 'nu bơngai Đan chĕp tơmam tơblah, khêl, đao, năm đơ̆ng pơlei Sôra păng Êstaôl."
"Then they went up and encamped in Kirjath Jearim in Judah. (Therefore they call that place Mahaneh Dan to this day. There it is, west of Kirjath Jearim.)","Lu sư tŏk pơm kơđông tơ pơlei Kiriat Jêrim lăm char Juđa. Yua kơ thoi noh na đe anăn anih noh pơlei Mahaneh Đan truh tơ dang ei."
"And they passed from there to the mountains of Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.","Đơ̆ng noh lu sư năm rok truh tơ groi kông Êphraim păng năm truh hloi tơ hnam Mika."
"Then the five men who had gone to spy out the country of Laish answered and said to their brethren, “Do you know that there are in these houses an ephod, household idols, a carved image, and a molded image? Now therefore, consider what you should do.”","Pơđăm 'nu chop lăng dêh khan kơ lu 'nhŏng oh sư: “Lu iĕm hăm băt lăm hnam noh đei minh blah ao êphot, dôm tŏ rup Yang păng rup Yang man păng minh pơm rup yang đe hling? Dang ei lu iĕm băt boih bơ̆n wă pơm kiơ.”"
"So they turned aside there, and came to the house of the young Levite man—to the house of Micah—and greeted him.","Na lu sư năm tơ noh mơ̆t lăm hnam bơngai Lêwi 'noh oei lăm hnam Mika na apinh hăm kơkuh kơ sư."
"The six hundred men armed with their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate.","Đei tơdrâu-hrĕng 'nu lu bơngai Đan chĕp tơmam tơblah khêl đao dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t 'nguaih kơ 'măng jang."
"Then the five men who had gone to spy out the land went up. Entering there, they took the carved image, the ephod, the household idols, and the molded image. The priest stood at the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men who were armed with weapons of war.","Lu pơđăm 'nu mă đêl năm chop lăng dêh 'noh lu sư mơ̆t lăm hnam tơtông iŏk rup man, ao êphot, lu rup yang nai păng rup yang đe hling đe tuh; kơplah noh 'bok soi oei dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t 'măng hơdai hăm lu tơdrâu-hrĕng 'nu chĕp tơmam tơblah khêl đao."
"When these went into Micah’s house and took the carved image, the ephod, the household idols, and the molded image, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?”","Kơplah lu pơđăm 'nu mơ̆t lăm hnam Mika tơtông iŏk rup man, ao êphot, lu rup yang păng rup yang đe hling đe tuh, 'bok soi apinh lu sư: Lu iĕm pơm kiơ?"
"And they said to him, “Be quiet, put your hand over your mouth, and come with us; be a father and a priest to us. Is it better for you to be a priest to the household of one man, or that you be a priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?”","Lu sư khan: Thĕng bĕ 'nĕ kơ pơma, iŏk ti đơ̆p 'bơ̆r ih păng năm hăm lu nhôn, pơm 'bă pơm 'bok soi lu bơ̆n, ih pơm 'bok soi ăn kơ minh pơm hnam dơnŏ dah pơm 'bok soi ăn kơ minh adrĕch adrung lu bơngai Isơrael, ayơ mă 'lơ̆ng hloh?"
"So the priest’s heart was glad; and he took the ephod, the household idols, and the carved image, and took his place among the people.","'Bok soi 'noh hiôk lăm jơhngơ̆m iŏk hloi ao êphot, rup yang păng rup man ei kiơ̆ hloi hăm khŭl noh."
"Then they turned and departed, and put the little ones, the livestock, and the goods in front of them.","Lu sư lê̆ lu hơ'lơ̆p, sem dơrong păng tơmam năm adrol na lu sư năm wơ̆t tơ rŏng brŏk hloi."
"When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men who were in the houses near Micah’s house gathered together and overtook the children of Dan.","Lăp lu sư năm ataih 'biơ̆ đơ̆ng hnam Mika đei lu bơngai đơ̆ng hnam Mika păng lu rông 'bôt sư lu sư akŭm dih băl druh 'moi tam lu bơngai Đan."
"And they called out to the children of Dan. So they turned around and said to Micah, “What ails you, that you have gathered such a company?”","Lu sư jreo ôr kiơ̆ đơ̆ng rŏng; lu bơngai Đan hue tơ rŏng jet Mika: Ih đei tơdrong kiơ ih mah chông ba lu bơngai lơ thoi noh?"
"So he said, “You have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and you have gone away. Now what more do I have? How can you say to me, ‘What ails you?’ ”","Mika tơl: Lu iĕm tơtông iŏk ba đĭ rup yang inh pơm păng chông anhăk hloi 'bok soi inh? Liơ mă iĕm oei apinh khan, Ih đei tơdrong kiơ?"
"And the children of Dan said to him, “Do not let your voice be heard among us, lest angry men fall upon you, and you lose your life, with the lives of your household!”","Bơngai Đan tơl Mika: 'Nĕ pă ăn nhôn kơtơ̆ng nơ̆r ih dơ̆ng, hli kơ đei bơngai blĕk ơh blah iŏk rôp ih pơlôch tơhiong tơdrong arih ih, hăm tơdrong arih hnam dơnŏ ih."
"Then the children of Dan went their way. And when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.","Lu bơngai Đan kư̆ kơ yak năm tơ anăp; Mika 'bôh lu sư pran hloh, na sư wih tơ rŏng wơ̆t brŏk tơ hnam."
"So they took the things Micah had made, and the priest who had belonged to him, and went to Laish, to a people quiet and secure; and they struck them with the edge of the sword and burned the city with fire.","Đơ̆ng noh bơngai Đan chĕp ba đĭ tơmam kiơ ma Mika đei pơm boih păng chông ba 'bok soi sư, lu bơngai Đan năm tơ pơlei Lais, minh adrĕch kon pơlei âu oei hiôk-hian, iŏk đao gưm pơlôch kon pơlei păng iŏk ŭnh soh hloi pơlei."
"There was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no ties with anyone. It was in the valley that belongs to Beth Rehob. So they rebuilt the city and dwelt there.","Ưh kơ đei bu dŏng pơklaih pơlei Lais, yua kơ lu sư oei ataih đơ̆ng pơlei Siđôn, păng lu sư kư̆m ưh kơ đei mơ̆t lĕch hăm đe bu nai: Pơlei noh oei lăm thŭng jê̆ Bet Rêhôp.

"And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel. However, the name of the city formerly was Laish.","Lu sư krao anăn pơlei noh Đan, kiơ̆ anăn 'bok sư, Đan kon drŏ-nglo Isơrael; đe krao pơlei 'noh sơ̆ Lais."
"Then the children of Dan set up for themselves the carved image; and Jonathan the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.","Tơ noh bơngai Đan lu sư chă tơiung ming rup Yang păng iŏk Jônathan kon drŏ-nglo Gersôm sâu Môis lu kon sâu sư pơtrơp pơm 'bok soi kơ adrĕch Đan truh tơ năr đe blah iŏk dêh noh."
"So they set up for themselves Micah’s carved image which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.","Lu sư oei kơkuh kơ rup yang đơ̆ng Mika man. Kơplah lăm chăl hnam akŭm Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei oei tơ Silô."
"And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite staying in the remote mountains of Ephraim. He took for himself a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah.","Kơplah noh lu bơngai Isơrael ưh kơ đei pơtao.

"But his concubine played the harlot against him, and went away from him to her father’s house at Bethlehem in Judah, and was there four whole months.","Akăn kơnhŏng noh sư pơm pơyô kư̆ kă, achăng lê̆ klo, na sư brŏk tơ hnam 'bă sư tơ pơlei Betlehem lăm dêh Juđa.

"Then her husband arose and went after her, to speak kindly to her and bring her back, having his servant and a couple of donkeys with him. So she brought him into her father’s house; and when the father of the young woman saw him, he was glad to meet him.","klo sư năm 'moi sư pơma pơlung pơ'lơ̆ng jơhngơ̆m sư, wă iŏk sư brŏk klo sư chông ba minh 'nu đĭch đam sư păng 'bar tŏ aseh iĕ.

"Now his father-in-law, the young woman’s father, detained him; and he stayed with him three days. So they ate and drank and lodged there.","Tơnei sư 'bă bơngai drŏ-kăn noh gơ̆t ŏng sư tep tơ noh, na ŏng sư 'bĭch hloi tơ noh hăm bơ̆n kră sư lăm pêng năr, sŏng sa hơdai 'bĭch tep tơ noh hloi."
"Then it came to pass on the fourth day that they arose early in the morning, and he stood to depart; but the young woman’s father said to his son-in-law, “Refresh your heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way.”","Truh năr mă puăn lu sư iung đơ̆ng hrôih hơmet wă yak brŏk.

"So they sat down, and the two of them ate and drank together. Then the young woman’s father said to the man, “Please be content to stay all night, and let your heart be merry.”","Thoi noh klo kăn bre sư hơ-oei sŏng sa hơdai, na 'bă bơngai drŏ-kăn noh khan dơ̆ng: Ơ dăm, apinh ih oei tơ âu pă minh măng âu dơ̆ng wă kơ jơhngơ̆m ih hiôk chơt."
"And when the man stood to depart, his father-in-law urged him; so he lodged there again.","Bơngai Lêwi iung wă năm ră, mă-lei bơ̆n kră sư pơlung, apinh sư jing sư wơ̆t 'bĭch lăm măng 'noh dơ̆ng."
"Then he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart, but the young woman’s father said, “Please refresh your heart.” So they delayed until afternoon; and both of them ate.","Truh năr mă pơđăm, sư iung đơ̆ng hrôih wă brŏk, mă-lei 'bă bơngai drŏ-kăn noh pơma dơnuh hăm sư: “Apinh ih ngôi tơ âu dơ̆ng hơya truh tơ kơsơ̆, gô sŏng sa chơt hiôk 'mơ̆i.” Na lu sư sŏng sa hơdai."
"And when the man stood to depart—he and his concubine and his servant—his father-in-law, the young woman’s father, said to him, “Look, the day is now drawing toward evening; please spend the night. See, the day is coming to an end; lodge here, that your heart may be merry. Tomorrow go your way early, so that you may get home.”","Lăp bơngai Lêwi, hăm akăn kơnhŏng păng đĭch đam sư wă iung yak, wă tơklah đơ̆ng bơ̆n kră sư, tơnei sư khan dơ̆ng: “Bre kon lăng 'năr kơsơ̆ wă măng boih, inh wă kơ măr iĕm oei 'bĭch ngôi tơ âu pă minh măng âu dơ̆ng.

"However, the man was not willing to spend that night; so he rose and departed, and came opposite Jebus (that is, Jerusalem). With him were the two saddled donkeys; his concubine was also with him.","Mă-lei ŏng sư ưh kơ wă 'bĭch măng noh dơ̆ng, sư iung brŏk hăm akăn kơnhŏng sư kư̆m kiơ̆ mơ̆n păng bơngai buăl sư hloi mơ̆n, anhăk ba 'bar tŏ aseh iĕ tah an, sư năm truh tơ pơlei Jêbus.a"
"They were near Jebus, and the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master, “Come, please, and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites and lodge in it.”","Lăp lu sư năm truh jê̆ tơ pơlei Jêbus 'năr wă mơ̆t boih, na đĭch đam sư khan; ơ 'bok bĕ bơ̆n mơ̆t lăm pơlei Jêbus âu 'bĭch tơ âu minh măng."
"But his master said to him, “We will not turn aside here into a city of foreigners, who are not of the children of Israel; we will go on to Gibeah.”","'Bok tơ'ngla sư tơl: Lu bơ̆n ưh kơ gơh mơ̆t ôh lăm minh pôm pơlei tơmoi, mă ưh kơ trŏ kon pơlei bơngai Isơrael.

"So he said to his servant, “Come, let us draw near to one of these places, and spend the night in Gibeah or in Ramah.”","Yŏng tơ'ngla khan kơ sư dơ̆ng: Bĕ bơ̆n adrin năm truh tơ pơlei Gibêah dah pơlei Rama, bơ̆n 'bĭch tơ pơlei 'noh."
"And they passed by and went their way; and the sun went down on them near Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin.","Thoi noh na lu sư kư̆ kơ năm; lăp truh pơlei Gibêah, lăm char Bênjamin, năr mơ̆t hloi boih."
"They turned aside there to go in to lodge in Gibeah. And when he went in, he sat down in the open square of the city, for no one would take them into his house to spend the night.","Lu sư weh tơ pơlei Gibêah; wă mơ̆t 'bĭch ră, lu sư mơ̆t lăm pơlei boih, ngôi 'bơ̆t cham, đe juăt akŭm ưh kơ đei bu sơng iŏk lu sư mơ̆t 'bĭch tơ lăm hnam lăm măng 'noh."
"Just then an old man came in from his work in the field at evening, who also was from the mountains of Ephraim; he was staying in Gibeah, whereas the men of the place were Benjamites.","Đei tơ'bơ̆p hĭ minh 'nu kră sư 'nao wih đơ̆ng jang kơsơ̆; kră ei sư bơngai đơ̆ng tơring groi kông Êphraim, mă-lei sư oei tơ pơlei Gibêah.

"And when he raised his eyes, he saw the traveler in the open square of the city; and the old man said, “Where are you going, and where do you come from?”","Wă bơngai kră âu sư tơmang lăng sư 'bôh bơngai tơmoi oei ngôi 'bơ̆t cham pơlei, sư apinh hloi: Lu iĕm đơ̆ng yơ wă năm tơ yơ?"
"So he said to him, “We are passing from Bethlehem in Judah toward the remote mountains of Ephraim; I am from there. I went to Bethlehem in Judah; now I am going to the house of the LORD. But there is no one who will take me into his house","Lu bơngai tơmoi ei tơl: Lu nhôn năm đơ̆ng pơlei Betlehem dêh Juđa, lu nhôn weh tơ âu wă wih tơring kueng lăm tơring char groi kông Êphraim, inh oei; tơ noh inh năm tơ pơlei Betlehem dêh Juđa 'nâu lu nhôn năm mơ̆t tơ hnam Kră Yang, ưh kơ đei bơngai bu sơng iŏk nhôn mơ̆t tơ hnam sư."
"although we have both straw and fodder for our donkeys, and bread and wine for myself, for your female servant, and for the young man who is with your servant; there is no lack of anything.”","Lu nhôn kư̆m oei đei hơnong 'ba păng 'nhĕt kơ hiĕm aseh iĕ lu nhôn, 'bĕng sa păng đak hơmu oei tơm mah mơ̆n.

"And the old man said, “Peace be with you! However, let all your needs be my responsibility; only do not spend the night in the open square.”","Bơngai kră ei khan: “Lu iĕm 'nĕ tơtăm kiơ! Inh gô hiơ̆k chă ăn kơ lu iĕm tơmam yua, mă-lei iĕm ưh kơ gơh 'bĭch tep tơ 'nguaih cham pơlei thoi âu.”"
"So he brought him into his house, and gave fodder to the donkeys. And they washed their feet, and ate and drank.","Bơngai kră ei pơtơm lu sư mơ̆t lăm hnam sư, ăn kơ aseh iĕ sa, đang kơ noh lu sư ôp hơrao jơ̆ng ti, sŏng sa."
"As they were enjoying themselves, suddenly certain men of the city, perverted men, surrounded the house and beat on the door. They spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, “Bring out the man who came to your house, that we may know him carnally!”","Kơplah lu sư oei sŏng sa hiôk chơt đei lu bơngai drŏ-nglo kơnê̆ lăm pơlei 'noh wang tăp kơ hnam 'noh gơgŭ 'măng; lu sư khan kơ 'bok kră tơ'ngla hnam 'noh: Athei ih tơlĕch bĕ bơngai 'noh đơ̆ng lăm hnam ih, lê̆ lu nhôn ngôi kư̆ kă lăm sư."
"But the man, the master of the house, went out to them and said to them, “No, my brethren! I beg you, do not act so wickedly! Seeing this man has come into my house, do not commit this outrage.","Tơ'ngla hnam 'noh lĕch tơ 'nguaih khan kơ lu sư: Ơ lu 'nhŏng oh inh, 'nĕ kơ pơm tơdrong kơnê̆ âu; inh sơng iŏk bơngai âu mơ̆t lăm hnam inh, iĕm 'nĕ kơ pơm yoch kơnê̆ kơ sư."
"Look, here is my virgin daughter and the man’s concubine; let me bring them out now. Humble them, and do with them as you please; but to this man do not do such a vile thing!”","Âu kon adruh inh oei hơlai hơnĭl păng akăn kơnhŏng sư to, inh gô chông măr sư lĕch tơ 'nguaih; mơ̆ng kơ lu iĕm wă pơm kơ bre sư liơ kư̆m bưh mă-lei bơngai âu iĕm ưh kơ gơh pơm kơnê̆ kư̆ kă kơ sư ôh."
"But the men would not heed him. So the man took his concubine and brought her out to them. And they knew her and abused her all night until morning; and when the day began to break, they let her go.","'Bok 'noh pơma thoi noh ră mă-lei lu sư ưh kơ mơ̆ng ôh; đơ̆ng noh bơngai tơmoi ei iŏk akăn kơnhŏng sư tơlơ̆ tơ 'nguaih ăn kơ lu sư; lu sư pơm kơnê̆ pơ'brơh kơ drŏ-kăn ei prăt măng truh tơ pơgê, kơplah 'năr wă lĕch lu sư achăng bơngai drŏ-kăn noh."
"Then the woman came as the day was dawning, and fell down at the door of the man’s house where her master was, till it was light.","Wă jê̆ pơgê hơdah bơngai drŏ-kăn ei wih tơ hnam 'bok kră mă hnam klo sư 'bĭch, sư pơ̆k hraih đang 'bơ̆t 'măng 'bĭch tơ noh truh 'năr hơdah."
"When her master arose in the morning, and opened the doors of the house and went out to go his way, there was his concubine, fallen at the door of the house with her hands on the threshold.","Pơgê hrôih 'noh klo sư iung, pơih 'măng wă brŏk 'bôh akăn kơnhŏng sư pơ̆k hraih đang 'bơ̆t anăp 'măng 'bar pah ti sư rôp kơtơ̆n."
"And he said to her, “Get up and let us be going.” But there was no answer. So the man lifted her onto the donkey; and the man got up and went to his place.","Sư khan kơ drŏ-kăn: Adrin Iung bĕ, lu bơ̆n wă yak; mă-lei drŏ-kăn ei ưh kơ đei tơl sư lôch boih.

"When he entered his house he took a knife, laid hold of his concubine, and divided her into twelve pieces, limb by limb, and sent her throughout all the territory of Israel.","Lăp truh tơ hnam boih, sư iŏk săng, chơ̆ng jơ̆ng ti akâu akăn kơnhŏng sư mơjĭt-'bar jăl chă ba tơ jơ̆p teh đak Isơrael."
"And so it was that all who saw it said, “No such deed has been done or seen from the day that the children of Israel came up from the land of Egypt until this day. Consider it, confer, and speak up!”","Đĭ-đăng bơngai 'bôh tơdrong 'noh hlĭch hlăch păng khan: Đơ̆ng năr kon pơlei Isơrael lĕch đơ̆ng dêh char Êyiptơ truh tơ dang ei ưh tam đei bu pơm păng 'bôh tơdrong truh thoi âu!

"So all the children of Israel came out, from Dan to Beersheba, as well as from the land of Gilead, and the congregation gathered together as one man before the LORD at Mizpah.","Đơ̆ng 'noh đĭ-đăng lu bơngai Isơrael akŭm băl, đơ̆ng Đan truh tơ Bêrsêba păng đơ̆ng dêh Gileat.

"And the leaders of all the people, all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand foot soldiers who drew the sword.","Lu yŏng pơgơ̆r kon pơlei đơ̆ng mơjĭt-'bar adrĕch bơngai Isơrael, đĭ-đăng lu sư đei măt tơm lăm năr akŭm tih lu kon pơlei Kră Yang.

"(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) Then the children of Israel said, “Tell us, how did this wicked deed happen?”","Lu bơngai Bênjamin kư̆m kơtơ̆ng khan: Kon pơlei Isơrael đei năm akŭm băl boih tơ Mispa.

"So the Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered and said, “My concubine and I went into Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin, to spend the night.","Thoi noh bơngai Lêwi klo bơngai drŏ-kăn mă lôch tơl: Inh mơ̆t lăm pơlei Gibêah lăm char Bênjamin, inh hăm akăn kơnhŏng inh; nhôn wă 'bĭch tep tơ noh."
"And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and surrounded the house at night because of me. They intended to kill me, but instead they ravished my concubine so that she died.","Lu drŏ-nglo pơlei Gibêah wă pơm kơ inh, lu sư wang hnam inh 'bĭch; lu sư wă pơlôch inh ră, na pơm pơ'brơh kơ akăn kơnhŏng inh dĭng sư lôch."
"So I took hold of my concubine, cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the territory of the inheritance of Israel, because they committed lewdness and outrage in Israel.","Đơ̆ng noh, inh chơ iŏk akâu akăn inh, chơ̆ng hơjăl, na ăn kơ đe năm ba tơ jơ̆p kơ teh đak Isơrael yua kơ lu sư đei pơm boih tơdrong kơnê̆ dêh thoi noh pơm pơ'brơh 'mê̆-'mach lăm char Isơrael."

"So all the people arose as one man, saying, “None of us will go to his tent, nor will any turn back to his house","Đĭ-đăng kon pơlei hiơ̆r minh jơhngơ̆m iung thoi lĕ kơ minh 'nu bơngai, lu sư khan: Lu nhôn ưh pă wơ̆t brŏk tơ hnam, thoi noh lăm lu nhôn ưh kơ đei bu wă wih brŏk tơ hnam sư kơdih ôh"
"but now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: We will go up against it by lot.","mă-lei 'nâu tơdrong lu bơ̆n athei pơm kơ pơlei Gibêah: Lu bơ̆n athei tŏk blah pơlei 'noh kiơ̆ kơ đei hlang lăng."
"We will take ten men out of every hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, a hundred out of every thousand, and a thousand out of every ten thousand, to make provisions for the people, that when they come to Gibeah in Benjamin, they may repay all the vileness that they have done in Israel.”","Lu bơ̆n athei rơih iŏk mơjĭt 'nu drŏ-nglo lăm minh-hrĕng đơ̆ng đĭ-đăng lăm adrĕch bơngai Isơrael; lăm minh-rơbâu klah rơih iŏk minh-hrĕng 'nu, lăm mơjĭt-rơbâu rơih iŏk minh-rơbâu; lê̆ lu sư chă ba tơmam sa ăn kơ lu kon pơlei pơla mưh lu linh bơ̆n truh tơ noh lu bơ̆n gô pơm kơ pơlei Gibêah lăm char Bênjamin kiơ̆ thoi sư pơm kơnê̆ pơ'brơh lăm char Isơrael."
"So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, united together as one man.","Thoi noh lu bơngai Isơrael akŭm băl đĭ-đăng minh jơhngơ̆m đon thoi minh 'nu năm blah pơlei 'noh."
"Then the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, “What is this wickedness that has occurred among you?","Dôm lu adrĕch Isơrael wơh lu bơngai năm jơ̆p tơ rim tơring bơngai Bênjamin, na khan: Tơdrong kơnê̆ krưp dêh lăm lu iĕm noh liơ?"
"Now therefore, deliver up the men, the perverted men who are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death and remove the evil from Israel!” But the children of Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brethren, the children of Israel.","Jao bĕ kơ lu nhôn lu bơngai kơnê̆ pơm kư̆ kă krưp dêh noh đơ̆ng lăm pơlei Gibêah, lê̆ lu nhôn pơlôch lu sư wă sŭt pơgoh đĭ tơdrong kơnê̆ noh đơ̆ng lăm bơngai Isơrael.

"Instead, the children of Benjamin gathered together from their cities to Gibeah, to go to battle against the children of Israel.","Lu bơngai Bênjamin lĕch đơ̆ng pơlei lu sư păng năm akŭm băl tơ pơlei Gibêah wă tơblah bơngai Isơrael."
"And from their cities at that time the children of Benjamin numbered twenty-six thousand men who drew the sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who numbered seven hundred select men.","Lăm năr 'noh, lu bơngai Bênjamin pơtơm băl đơ̆ng lu pơlei truh tơ noh, đĭ-đăng đei 'bar-jĭt tơdrâu-rơbâu 'nu bơngai drŏ-nglo gơh hơgei chĕp khêl đao gưm thim đơ̆ng pơlei Gibêah đei tơpơh-hrĕng 'nu lu linh hơgei kơ chĕp khêl đao đe rơih boih."

"Then the children of Israel arose and went up to the house of God to inquire of God.

"So the children of Israel rose in the morning and encamped against Gibeah.","Pơgê đơ̆ng rŏng lu bơngai Isơrael iung đơ̆ng hrôih pơm kơđông jê̆ pơlei Gibêah."
"And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin, and the men of Israel put themselves in battle array to fight against them at Gibeah.","Bơngai Isơrael năm blah bơngai Bênjamin; săp lu linh wă năm blah pơlei Gibêah"
"Then the children of Benjamin came out of Gibeah, and on that day cut down to the ground twenty-two thousand men of the Israelites.","lu bơngai Bênjamin lĕch đơ̆ng pơlei Gibêah 'bet pơlôch 'bar-jĭt 'bar-rơbâu 'nu lu bơngai Isơrael lăm năr noh."

"Then the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until evening, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, “Shall I again draw near for battle against the children of my brother Benjamin?” And the LORD said, “Go up against him.”","Lu bơngai Isơrael tŏk nhơ̆m hmoi 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, truh tơ kơmăng hloi.

"So the children of Israel approached the children of Benjamin on the second day.","Thoi noh wơ̆t mă 'bar lu bơngai Isơrael pơtơm băl năm blah lu bơngai Bênjamin."
"And Benjamin went out against them from Gibeah on the second day, and cut down to the ground eighteen thousand more of the children of Israel; all these drew the sword.","Lu bơngai Bênjamin lĕch đơ̆ng pơlei Gibêah, lu sư năm blah lu bơngai Isơrael, pơlôch mơjĭt-tơhngam rơbâu 'nu kon pơlei Isơrael dŏng, 'noh tă tơ lu bơngai gơh hơgei kơ chĕp khêl đao gưm ngăl."
"Then all the children of Israel, that is, all the people, went up and came to the house of God and wept.

"So the children of Israel inquired of the LORD (the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days","Lu kon pơlei Isơrael krao apinh Kră Yang, yua kơ lăm kơplah 'noh hom pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei oei lê̆ tơ noh."
"and Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days), saying, “Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of my brother Benjamin, or shall I cease?” And the LORD said, “Go up, for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hand.”","Đei Phinêhas, kon drŏ-nglo Êlêasar sâu Arôn, bơ̆jang 'bơ̆t anăp hom pơgơ̆p noh.

"Then Israel set men in ambush all around Gibeah.","Lu bơngai Isơrael wang tăp dăr kơ pơlei Gibêah."
"And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in battle array against Gibeah as at the other times.","Truh năr mă pêng kon pơlei Isơrael tŏk wă blah hăm bơngai Bênjamin păng klah asong lu linh năm blah pơlei Gibêah thoi lĕ năr adrol ki."
"So the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city. They began to strike down and kill some of the people, as at the other times, in the highways (one of which goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah) and in the field, about thirty men of Israel.","Lu bơngai Bênjamin lĕch năm tơblah hăm lu bơngai Isơrael, lu sư druh bơngai Isơrael kơdâu ataih đơ̆ng pơlei ưh kơ băt lu linh Isơrael wă kơ lu sư lĕch ataih đơ̆ng pơlei sư thoi noh.

"And the children of Benjamin said, “They are defeated before us, as at first.” But the children of Israel said, “Let us flee and draw them away from the city to the highways.”","Lu bơngai Bênjamin khan tơduă: To lu bơ̆n blah lu sư kơdâu kơ bơ̆n lei-lăi thoi adrol ki mơ̆n, mă-lei lu bơngai Isơrael khan: Dang ei lu bơ̆n kơdâu rok trong wă pơhlŭ lu sư lĕch ataih đơ̆ng pơlei."
"So all the men of Israel rose from their place and put themselves in battle array at Baal Tamar.

"And ten thousand select men from all Israel came against Gibeah, and the battle was fierce.

"The LORD defeated Benjamin before Israel.

"So the children of Benjamin saw that they were defeated.

"And the men in ambush quickly rushed upon Gibeah; the men in ambush spread out and struck the whole city with the edge of the sword.","Lu linh mă răp gô tơ pơlei Gibêah lu sư kơdâu mơ̆t blah lăm pơlei Gibêah blah pơlôch pơrăm đĭ-đăng lu bơngai oei lăm pơlei 'noh hăm đao gưm."
"Now the appointed signal between the men of Israel and the men in ambush was that they would make a great cloud of smoke rise up from the city","Lu linh bơngai Isơrael đei pơkă băl boih hăm lu linh răp noh, dah đei mơ̆t blah pơlei boih athei soh 'nhui ŭnh găm tŏk tơ kơpal wă pơm tơdra"
"whereupon the men of Israel would turn in battle. Now Benjamin had begun to strike and kill about thirty of the men of Israel.

"But when the cloud began to rise from the city in a column of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and there was the whole city going up in smoke to heaven.","Mă-lei lăp 'bôh 'nhui 'noh păr tŏk đông tơ kơpal hloh kơ pơlei thoi jrăng 'nhui ŭnh, lu bơngai Bênjamin hue lăng tơ rŏng, 'bôh jơ̆p kơ lăm pơlei 'noh tă kơ 'bôh 'nhui ŭnh ngăl đông tŏk tơ plĕnh."

"Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel in the direction of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them, and whoever came out of the cities they destroyed in their midst.","Na lu sư tơwih rŏng kơdâu ôn đơ̆ng lu bơngai Isơrael, kơdâu tơ lăm char glă, mă-lei lu linh Isơrael druh blah lu sư, lu bơngai Isơrael mă lĕch đơ̆ng lăm pơlei 'noh kư̆m blah pơlôch đĭ lu sư."

"And the men of Israel turned back against the children of Benjamin, and struck them down with the edge of the sword—from every city, men and beasts, all who were found. They also set fire to all the cities they came to.","Lu bơngai Isơrael wơ̆t năm blah dơ̆ng lu bơngai Bênjamin koh pơlôch hăm đao gưm đĭ-đăng lu kon pơlei, pơrăm đĭ tơmam, sem dơrong, mơ̆ng kơ tơ'bơ̆p, soh rơng chhơng pơlei đĭ-đăng."
"Now the men of Israel had sworn an oath at Mizpah, saying, “None of us shall give his daughter to Benjamin as a wife.”","Tơ lăm pơlei Mispa, lu kon pơlei Isơrael đei pơkă pơkăm băl: Lăm lu bơ̆n ưh kơ gơh ăn kon drŏ-kăn bơ̆n iŏk klo đơ̆ng bơngai Bênjamin."
"Then the people came to the house of God, and remained there before God till evening. They lifted up their voices and wept bitterly","Đơ̆ng noh lu kon pơlei năm tơ pơlei Bethel hơ-oei tơ noh 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Kră Yang truh tơ kơsơ̆ măng, nhơ̆m hmoi ôr hơdrĭ dêh."
"and said, “O LORD God of Israel, why has this come to pass in Israel, that today there should be one tribe missing in Israel?”","Lu sư krao khan: Ơ Kră Yang, 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael, yua kơ kiơ dang ei lăm adrĕch Isơrael ưh pă tơm boih, lu nhôn hiong boih minh adrĕch."
"So it was, on the next morning, that the people rose early and built an altar there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.","Pơgê năr đơ̆ng rong lu kon pơlei pơla iung đơ̆ng hrôih pơm minh pơm chơnang soi păng pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'buh păng pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'blŏk bơnê."
"The children of Israel said, “Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who did not come up with the assembly to the LORD?” For they had made a great oath concerning anyone who had not come up to the LORD at Mizpah, saying, “He shall surely be put to death.”","Na lu kon pơlei Isơrael khan: Lăm lu adrĕch bơngai Isơrael bu mă ưh kơ đei akŭm hơdai bơ̆n 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang tơ âu?

"And the children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother, and said, “One tribe is cut off from Israel today.","Na lu bơngai Isơrael đĭ-đăng băt kơ hmach sơ'ngon kơ dôm tơdrong mă truh kơ lu bơngai Bênjamin, 'nhŏng oh lu sư, na lu sư khan: Năr 'nâu minh adrĕch hiong boih đơ̆ng adrĕch Isơrael."
"What shall we do for wives for those who remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them our daughters as wives?”","Lu bơ̆n wă pơm liơ kơ lu kon drŏ-nglo Bênjamin mă oei arih, yua kơ lu bơ̆n pơkă pơkăm hăm anăn Kră Yang boih ưh kơ ăn kon drŏ-kăn lu bơ̆n oei kơ lu sư?"
"And they said, “What one is there from the tribes of Israel who did not come up to Mizpah to the LORD?” And, in fact, no one had come to the camp from Jabesh Gilead to the assembly.","Đơ̆ng noh lu sư khan? Lăm dôm lu bơngai Isơrael bơngai bu ưh kơ đei năm dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang tơ Mispa? Đơ̆ng pơlei Jabes tơ Gileat ưh kơ đei bu năm akŭm hơdai lăm năr noh."
"For when the people were counted, indeed, not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead was there.","Yua kơ kơplah đe jơ̆ đĭ-đăng pơlei ưh kơ đei 'bôh bơngai bu đơ̆ng pơlei Jabes tơ Gileat."
"So the congregation sent out there twelve thousand of their most valiant men, and commanded them, saying, “Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword, including the women and children.","Na đơ̆ng khŭl akŭm wơh mơjĭt-'bar rơbâu 'nu lu bơngai nuih kơtang hloh năm tơ pơlei Gileat păng pơkă kơ lu sư: Năm bĕ, pơlôch đĭ kon pơlei Jabes tơ Gileat, hăm đao gưm pơlôch đĭ lu bơngai drŏ-kăn păng lu 'lơ̆p"
"And this is the thing that you shall do: You shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman who has known a man intimately.”","'Nâu tơdrong ăn kơ lu iĕm athei pơm: Pơlôch pơgoh đĭ dôm lu bơngai drŏ-nglo păng lu bơngai drŏ-kăn, mă ngôi hăm bơngai drŏ-nglo boih."
"So they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins who had not known a man intimately; and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.","Lu sư chă 'bôh bơih lăm pơlei Jabes tơ Gileat đei puăn-hrĕng 'nu drŏ-kăn oei hơdruh hle hơnĭl tam mă đei juăt hăm bơngai drŏ-nglo, na chông ba lu sư mơ̆t lăm kơđông tơ Silô lăm dêh Kanaan."
"Then the whole congregation sent word to the children of Benjamin who were at the rock of Rimmon, and announced peace to them.","Đơ̆ng noh kon pơlei bơngai akŭm wơh bơngai năm tơ'bơ̆p bơngai Bênjamin, mă oei ôn lăm hơgơp tơmo Rimôn, wă pơma dơnuh pơhiôk hăm lu sư."
"So Benjamin came back at that time, and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh Gilead; and yet they had not found enough for them.","Lu bơngai Bênjamin wih brŏk lu bơngai Isơrael rôp ăn kơ lu sư dôm lu bơngai drŏ-kăn mă lu sư mơnat ăn oei arih đơ̆ng pơlei Jabes tơ Gileat, mă-lei ưh kơ đei tôm kơ lu sư ôh."
"And the people grieved for Benjamin, because the LORD had made a void in the tribes of Israel.","Kon pơlei pơla Isơrael hmach dêh kơ tơdrong mă lu sư đei pơm kơ lu bơngai Bênjamin, yua kơ Kră Yang tơhiong đơ̆ng lăm adrĕch Isơrael."
"Then the elders of the congregation said, “What shall we do for wives for those who remain, since the women of Benjamin have been destroyed?”","Lu bơngai kră pơgơ̆r kon pơlei sư khan: Yua kơ đĭ-đăng lu bơngai drŏ-kăn lăm adrĕch Bênjamin đê̆ pơlôch đĭ boih, na lu bơ̆n wă pơm liơ gơh chă akăn ăn kơ lu bơngai mă oei arih?"
"And they said, “There must be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, that a tribe may not be destroyed from Israel.","Lu sư tơl dơ̆ng: Lu bơngai Bênjamin mă oei arih dang ei lu sư gơh đei iŏk mŭk tơmam đei adrĕch adrung wă kơ huay pă hiong boih đơ̆ng lăm bơngai Isơrael."
"However, we cannot give them wives from our daughters, for the children of Israel have sworn an oath, saying, ‘Cursed be the one who gives a wife to Benjamin.’ ”","Lu bơ̆n ưh kơ gơh ăn kon drŏ-kăn bơ̆n pơm akăn lu sư ôh yua kơ kon pơlei Isơrael pơkă pơkăm boih: Hiap pơtê̆ bĕ kơ bơngai bu mă rôp kon drŏ-kăn sư ăn kơ bơngai Bênjamin pơm akăn!"
"Then they said, “In fact, there is a yearly feast of the LORD in Shiloh, which is north of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah.”","Na lu sư khan: Iĕm lăng rim sơnăm bơ̆n đei pơm giĕng 'blŏk hơdơ̆r kơ Kră Yang tơ anih Silô, oei gah yă-nơ̆m kơ pơlei Bethel, gah hơlĕch kơ trong năm đơ̆ng pơlei Bethel truh tơ pơlei Sichem, gah gơal kơ pơlei Lêbơna"
"Therefore they instructed the children of Benjamin, saying, “Go, lie in wait in the vineyards","Lu sư khan kơ bơngai Bênjamin: Năm răp bĕ lăm lu pơgar hơmu"
"and watch; and just when the daughters of Shiloh come out to perform their dances, then come out from the vineyards, and every man catch a wife for himself from the daughters of Shiloh; then go to the land of Benjamin.","Păng lăng mưh 'bôh lu drŏ-kăn đơ̆ng Silô lĕch hơri suang na lu iĕm athei lĕch hloi đơ̆ng pơgar hơmu 'noh, đơ̆ng noh rim 'nu lu iĕm athei rôp iŏk minh 'nu adruh đơ̆ng pơlei Silô 'noh pơm akăn, păng wih brŏk tơ char Bênjamin."
"Then it shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to us to complain, that we will say to them, ‘Be kind to them for our sakes, because we did not take a wife for any of them in the war; for it is not as though you have given the women to them at this time, making yourselves guilty of your oath.’ ”","Mưh 'bă dah 'nhŏng oh lu sư kêng lu iĕm tơ lu nhôn, na lu nhôn gơh tơl sư: Apinh iĕm mơnat asong kơ lu sư rôp pơm akăn, yua kơ lăm kơplah tơblah ki lu nhôn ưh kơ gơh ăn kơ lu sư chă akăn lăm rim 'nu lu sư 'noh, Lu iĕm kư̆m ưh kơ gơh rôp ăn kơ lu sư chă akăn; yua kơ noh lu iĕm kư̆m ưh kơ đei pơm yoch hăm nơ̆r bơ̆n pơkăm."
"And the children of Benjamin did so; they took enough wives for their number from those who danced, whom they caught. Then they went and returned to their inheritance, and they rebuilt the cities and dwelt in them.","Lu bơngai Bênjamin pơm hloi thoi noh rôp iŏk kơdih minh 'nu drŏ-kăn noh pơm akăn: Na lu sư wih brŏk tơ dêh Bênjamin; lu sư man tơiung pơjing anih pơlei dơ̆ng păng lu sư oei tơ noh hloi."
"So the children of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and family; they went out from there, every man to his inheritance.","Lu bơngai Isơrael weh đơ̆ng noh wih brŏk tơ adrĕch adrung sư kơdih rim 'nu wih brŏk tơ dêh char sư kơdih."
"In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes.","Lăm kơplah 'noh ưh kơ đei pơtao ôh lăm bơngai Isơrael, na rim 'nu chă pơm kiơ̆ tơdrong tơchĕng kơdih khan trŏ."
