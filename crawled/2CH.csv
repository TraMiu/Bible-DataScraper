"Now Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him and exalted him exceedingly.","Sôlômôn, kon drŏ-nglo Đawit pơgơ̆r dêh char pơtao sư pran kơjăp; Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei oei hơdai sư ăn kơ sư pran kơjăp tih dêh tơpă."
"And Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges, and to every leader in all Israel, the heads of the fathers’ houses.","Sôlômôn pơma hăm đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael: Lu yŏng pơgơ̆r minh-rơbâu 'nu linh yŏng pơgơ̆r minh-hrĕng 'nu linh, lu 'bok sek tơlang păng lu yŏng kơdră lăm adrĕch bơngai Isơrael"
"Then Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for the tabernacle of meeting with God was there, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.","Sôlômôn păng đĭ-đăng Kon pơlei năm hơdai tŏk tơ anih kơjung tơ pơlei Gibeôn, yua kơ Bơsŭn Anih Akŭm Môis đĭch đam Kră Yang đei pơm pơdơ̆ng tơ char glă oei tơ noh."
"But David had brought up the ark of God from Kirjath Jearim to the place David had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.","Đawit đei chĕp ba bơih Hom tơdrong pơgơ̆p Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei đơ̆ng Kiriat.

"Now the bronze altar that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD; Solomon and the assembly sought Him there.","Gah chơnang soi păng kong mă Bêsalel, kon drŏ-nglo Uri, sâu Hur pơm boih dan 'bơ̆t anăp Bơsŭn Anih Akŭm Kră Yang; Sôlômôn hăm lu tơpôl akŭm chă Kră Yang tơ noh."
"And Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before the LORD, which was at the tabernacle of meeting, and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it.","Sôlômôn tŏk tơ anih chơnang soi kong dan 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, tơ Bơsŭn Anih Akŭm; na sư pơyơ̆r minh-rơbâu tŏ tơmam soi 'buh tơ kơpal chơnang soi noh."
"On that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, “Ask! What shall I give you?”","Lăm măng noh, Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei tơ'bôh kơ Sôlômôn păng khan: “Ih wă kơ Inh ăn kơ ih kiơ? Apinh bĕ.”"
"And Solomon said to God: “You have shown great mercy to David my father, and have made me king in his place.","Sôlômôn tơl Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei khan: “Ih đei tơ'bôh boih tơdrong 'mêm tih kơ 'bă inh Đawit păng kư̆m ăn kơ inh pơm pơtao pơtrơp sư."
"Now, O LORD God, let Your promise to David my father be established, for You have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.","Ơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei, apinh Ih pơsĭt bĕ nơ̆r Ih đei pơkă pơ'ngam hăm 'bă inh Đawit, gơh jing yua kơ Ih đei pôk inh pơm pơtao boih wă wei pơgơ̆r lu adrĕch adrung lơ kơdrâ̆m thoi 'mui teh âu."
"Now give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this great people of Yours?”","Thoi ei, apinh Ih ăn kơ inh gơh hơgei đei đon hlôh wao wă kơ inh gơh pơgơ̆r kon pơlei pơla 'nâu yua kơ bu kĕ wei-lăng pơgơ̆r kon pơlei Ih lơ kơdrơ̆m dêh thoi âu?”"
"Then God said to Solomon: “Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked riches or wealth or honor or the life of your enemies, nor have you asked long life—but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge My people over whom I have made you king","Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei khan kơ Sôlômôn: “Yua kơ ih đei boih jơhngơ̆m thoi noh, ưh kơ apinh ôh tơdrong mơdrŏng mơng, đe pơyom, dah tơdrong wă pơrăm lu bơngai pơm kơnê̆ kơ ih păng kư̆m ưh apinh wă kơ arih sot, mă-lei apinh tơdrong gơh hơgei đei đon hlôh wao wă kơ wei-lăng pơgơ̆r kon pơlei pơla Inh; kon pơlei mă Inh ăn kơ ih pơm pơtao"
"wisdom and knowledge are granted to you; and I will give you riches and wealth and honor, such as none of the kings have had who were before you, nor shall any after you have the like.”","Lei Inh ăn boih tơdrong gơh hơgei đei đon hlôh wao kơ ih: Inh kư̆m gô ăn kơ ih đei mŭk tơmam mơdrŏng tih, đe pơyom dĭng mah lu pơtao mă adrol dah đơ̆ng rŏng kơ ih kư̆m ưh kơ đei bu thoi noh."
"So Solomon came to Jerusalem from the high place that was at Gibeon, from before the tabernacle of meeting, and reigned over Israel.","Thoi noh Sôlômôn wih đơ̆ng anih kơjung tơ Gibeôn, dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp Bơsŭn Anih Akŭm, wih brŏk tơ pơlei Jêrusalem. Păng sư pơgơ̆r hloi bơngai Isơrael."
"And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen; he had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.","Sôlômôn akŭm lu gre aseh păng aseh, đei minh-rơbâu puăn-hrĕng tŏ gre aseh păng mơjĭt-'bar rơbâu tŏ aseh; 'măn lê̆ lăm pơlei tah gre aseh kư̆m hơdai hăm pơtao lăm Pơlei Jêrusalem."
"Also the king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars as abundant as the sycamores which are in the lowland.","Pơtao akŭm mong lu hu maih lăm Pơlei Jêrusalem lơ thoi tơmo hơga păng akŭm 'măn 'long hơngo lơ thoi 'long hơra bri lăm thŭng dơnă."
"And Solomon had horses imported from Egypt and Keveh; the king’s merchants bought them in Keveh at the current price.","Sôlômôn răt lơ aseh đơ̆ng dêh char Êyiptơ păng char Kue đơ̆ng lu bơngai mơdro kơ pơtao răt, 'long sư hơnơ̆ng kơ đe."
"They also acquired and imported from Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for one hundred and fifty; thus, through their agents, they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria.","Lu Sư răt ba đơ̆ng dêh char Êyiptơ lu gre aseh minh pôm gre dang tơdrâu-hrĕng sêikơl jên hu, lu aseh minh pôm minh-hrĕng pơđăm-jĭt sêikơl jên hu; lu đe âu kư̆m tĕch dơ̆ng kơ lu pơtao đe Hêtit păng pơtao dêh Siri."
"Then Solomon determined to build a temple for the name of the LORD, and a royal house for himself.","Sôlômôn krao wơh pơm Hnam akŭm kơ Anăn Kră Yang păng pơm minh pôm hnam pơtao kơ sư."
"Solomon selected seventy thousand men to bear burdens, eighty thousand to quarry stone in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred to oversee them.","Sôlômôn krao pơtơm đei tơpơh hơngan 'nu bơngai wă kơ tung tơ'mơn, tơhngam hơngan thơ̆ teh blah tơmo kơpal kông păng pêng-rơbâu tơdrâu-hrĕng 'nu bơngai lăng wơh đe jang."
"Then Solomon sent to Hiram king of Tyre, saying: As you have dealt with David my father, and sent him cedars to build himself a house to dwell in, so deal with me.","Sôlômôn gơih nơ̆r kơ Hiram pơtao dêh Tirơ khan: “Ih đei tơgŭm bơih 'bă inh, Đawit, ăn boih, 'long hơngo wă pơm hnam pơtao sư; apinh ih kư̆m tơgŭm inh thoi noh."
"Behold, I am building a temple for the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate it to Him, to burn before Him sweet incense, for the continual showbread, for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the Sabbaths, on the New Moons, and on the set feasts of the LORD our God. This is an ordinance forever to Israel.","Dang ei inh wă pơm hnam kơ Anăn Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei inh, wă 'măn lê̆ Hnam noh kơ Sư, wă soh 'long 'bâu phu 'bơ̆t anăp Sư, dan 'bĕng rơgoh ling-lang, pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'buh kiơ̆ pơgê păng gah kơsơ̆, păng lăm năr Sa'bat, năr Khei Tơ'bang blŭng-a Khei Tơ'bang, păng lăm lu năr giĕng Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei nhôn; noh bơih minh tơdrong pơkă kơ lu bơngai Isơrael athei kiơ̆ ling-lang hloi."
"And the temple which I build will be great, for our God is greater than all gods.","Hnam mă inh wă pơm tih dêh tơpă. Yua kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu nhôn tih dêh hloh kơ lu yang nai."
"But who is able to build Him a temple, since heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain Him? Who am I then, that I should build Him a temple, except to burn sacrifice before Him?","Lei na bu kĕ pơm ăn hnam kơ Kră Yang? Mă lu plĕnh, plĕnh kơ lu tăl plĕnh kư̆m ưh kơ gơh 'măn kơ Sư mơ̆n!

"Therefore send me at once a man skillful to work in gold and silver, in bronze and iron, in purple and crimson and blue, who has skill to engrave with the skillful men who are with me in Judah and Jerusalem, whom David my father provided.","Na dang ei pơtao athei chă gơih ăn kơ inh lu bơngai hơgei gơh hling maih, hu, kong, mam, bơngai tanh brai che 'brê hơhĭm, jơk 'brê gôh, kư̆m gơh chrek chhơ̆, wă kơ bơ̆jang hăm lu bơngai thơ̆ hơgei inh, tơ dêh Juđa păng pơlei Jêrusalem, mă 'bă inh Đawit đei ăn boih sơ̆."
"Also send me cedar and cypress and algum logs from Lebanon, for I know that your servants have skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and indeed my servants will be with your servants","Kŭm athei gơih ăn kơ inh 'long hơngo, 'long hơngo hla iĕ, 'long kơte đơ̆ng char Liban, yua kơ inh băt lu bơngai jang kơ ih juăt kơ kăl 'long đơ̆ng char Liban, lu bơngai jang kơ inh gô jang hơdai lu bơngai bơ̆jang đơ̆ng ih."
"to prepare timber for me in abundance, for the temple which I am about to build shall be great and wonderful.","Wă kơ lu sư kăl 'long mă lơ; yua kơ Hnam akŭm inh wă pơm gô tih păng rŏ tơpă."
"And indeed I will give to your servants, the woodsmen who cut timber, twenty thousand kors of ground wheat, twenty thousand kors of barley, twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.","Inh gô ăn lu bơngai jang, kăl 'long đơ̆ng ih, 'bar-jĭt rơbâu kôr (dang 'bar-hrĕng puăn-jĭt kĭ) 'ba tơ'bâu, 'bar-jĭt rơbâu kôr 'ba mi, 'bar-jĭt rơbâu lit sik hơmu păng 'bar-jĭt rơbâu lit đak rơmă ôliwơ.”"
"Then Hiram king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon: Because the LORD loves His people, He has made you king over them.","Hiram, pơtao Tirơ, chih hla bơar tơl Sôlômôn: Yua kơ Kră Yang 'mêm mơnat kơ kon pơlei Sư, lei na pôk ih pơm pơtao lu sư."
"Hiram also said: Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who made heaven and earth, for He has given King David a wise son, endowed with prudence and understanding, who will build a temple for the LORD and a royal house for himself!","Hiram khan dơ̆ng: “Bơnê kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael, Kră Yang Tơ'ngla pơjing kơ plĕnh teh, Sư đei ăn boih kơ pơtao Đawit minh 'nu kon drŏ-nglo gơh hơgei, hlôh wao wă pơm hnam kơ Kră Yang păng wă pơm minh pôm hnam pơtao kơ sư."
"And now I have sent a skillful man, endowed with understanding, Huram my master craftsman","Dang ei, inh gơih ăn kơ ih Huram Abi, sư bơngai hơgei dêh gơh pơm tôm."
"(the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre), skilled to work in gold and silver, bronze and iron, stone and wood, purple and blue, fine linen and crimson, and to make any engraving and to accomplish any plan which may be given to him, with your skillful men and with the skillful men of my lord David your father.","Mĕ sư đơ̆ng adrĕch Đan, 'bă sư bơngai đơ̆ng Pơlei Tirơ.

"Now therefore, the wheat, the barley, the oil, and the wine which my lord has spoken of, let him send to his servants.","Thoi ei na apinh ih gơih ăn kơ lu đĭch đam ih 'ba tơ'bâu, 'ba mi, đak rơmă păng sik đak hơmu, thoi ih yŏng inh đei khan boih."
"And we will cut wood from Lebanon, as much as you need; we will bring it to you in rafts by sea to Joppa, and you will carry it up to Jerusalem.","Na lu nhôn gô năm kăl 'long đơ̆ng char Liban kiơ̆ dôm yơ ih kăl wă, chô̆ pơm hơkĭ pơđông rok đak trong dơsĭ truh tơ Pơlei Jôpa, đơ̆ng noh ih gô iŏk hơtŏk ba tơ Pơlei Jêrusalem.”"
"Then Solomon numbered all the aliens who were in the land of Israel, after the census in which David his father had numbered them; and there were found to be one hundred and fifty-three thousand six hundred.","Sôlômôn chih jô̆ đĭ-đăng lu bơngai tơmoi oei lăm char Isơrael ki thoi kơ Đawit, 'bă sư đei chih jô̆ boih, đei minh-hrĕng pơđăm-jĭt pêng-rơbâu tơdrâu-hrĕng 'nu"
"And he made seventy thousand of them bearers of burdens, eighty thousand stonecutters in the mountain, and three thousand six hundred overseers to make the people work.","Lăm noh đei jao ăn kơ tơpơh-jĭt rơbâu 'nu bơngai tung tôi 'long, tơhngam-jĭt rơbâu 'nu blah teh tơmo tơ kơpal kông păng đei pêng-rơbâu tơdrâu-hrĕng 'nu bơngai wei wơh kon pơlei jang."
"Now Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where the LORD had appeared to his father David, at the place that David had prepared on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.","Sôlômôn pơtơm pơm hnam akŭm kơ Kră Yang lăm pơlei Jêrusalem, kơpal kông Môria, anih mă Kră Yang đei jur tơ'bôh kơ Đawit, 'bă sư, tơ anih mă Đawit đei rơ̆ng hơmet, 'bơ̆t anih pơjuă 'ba Arauna, bơngai Jêbus."
"And he began to build on the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign.","Sôlômôn pơtơm pơm hnam akŭm năr mă 'bar khei 'bar, sơnăm mă puăn lăm chăl sư pơgơ̆r."
"This is the foundation which Solomon laid for building the house of God: The length was sixty cubits (by cubits according to the former measure) and the width twenty cubits.","'Nâu hơnă mă Sôlômôn đei man wă pơm hnam Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei: Să, kiơ̆ kơ hơgăt sơ̆, tor Sư tơdrâu-jĭt hơgăt; wơ̆l 'bar-jĭt hơgăt."
"And the vestibule that was in front of the sanctuary was twenty cubits long across the width of the house, and the height was one hundred and twenty. He overlaid the inside with pure gold.","Kơdeng gah anăp, tor să 'bar-jĭt hơgăt, hơtŏ kơ wơ̆l hnam akŭm; kơjung 'bar-jĭt hơgăt. Sư lom klơ̆p hăm maih se tơ lăm."
"The larger room he paneled with cypress which he overlaid with fine gold, and he carved palm trees and chainwork on it.","Tơnăr hnam akŭm, đe pĕng păng tơ̆r 'long hơngo lom hăm maih se, chhơ̆ rup 'long gol păng chhơ̆ rup glang tơ noh."
"And he decorated the house with precious stones for beauty, and the gold was gold from Parvaim.","Đe pơgong hăm tơmo rang gĭt wă pơhrôp sư; maih noh maih đơ̆ng char Parwai"
"He also overlaid the house—the beams and doorposts, its walls and doors—with gold; and he carved cherubim on the walls.","Hnam akŭm sư lom hăm maih, tơ̆r roh hơdrông, không 'măng, tơnăr păng 'măng hnam akŭm, 'bơ̆t tơnăr đe chhơ̆ rup chêrubim."
"And he made the Most Holy Place. Its length was according to the width of the house, twenty cubits, and its width twenty cubits. He overlaid it with six hundred talents of fine gold.","Sư kư̆m man anih Rơgoh 'lơ̆ng Hloh tor sư 'bar-jĭt hơgăt wơ̆l sư 'bar-jĭt hơgăt, pơtao lom klơ̆p anih noh hăm maih se; maih noh kŏng đei 21tân."
"The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold; and he overlaid the upper area with gold.","Lu kơđĭnh maih kŏng trăp đei 1kĭ 1gram 5; sư kư̆m lom maih tơ anih kơpal."
"In the Most Holy Place he made two cherubim, fashioned by carving, and overlaid them with gold.","Tơ lăm anih 'lơ̆ng Rơgoh Hloh, sư 'bok pơm kơtă 'bar tŏ chêrubim, lom hăm maih."
"The wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits in overall length: one wing of the one cherub was five cubits, touching the wall of the room, and the other wing was five cubits, touching the wing of the other cherub","Pơnăr chêrubim să 'bar-jĭt hơgăt; minh hlak pơnăr kơ minh pôm chêrubim gah 'ma kơjung pơđăm hơgăt, hơtŭt kơ tơnăr hnam akŭm; pơnăr minh pah kư̆m kơjung pơđăm hơgăt păng hơtŭt kơ pơnăr gah 'ngiĕo chêrubim mă 'bar."
"one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, touching the wall of the room, and the other wing also was five cubits, touching the wing of the other cherub.","Minh pah pơnăr chêrubim mă 'bar kư̆m pơđăm hơgăt kơjung, hơtŭt kơ tơnăr hnam akŭm gah to; pơnăr minh pah dơ̆ng kư̆m kơjung pơđăm hơgăt, tơ'bưh hơtŭt kơ pơnăr chêrubim mă mônh."
"The wings of these cherubim spanned twenty cubits overall. They stood on their feet, and they faced inward.","Pơnăr 'bar tŏ chêrubim bơyar ngăl kơjung sư đei 'bar-jĭt hơgăt; 'bar tŏ chêrubim dang dơ̆ng tơwih măt tơ gah tơnăr Anih 'lơ̆ng Rơgoh."
"And he made the veil of blue, purple, crimson, and fine linen, and wove cherubim into it.","Sư kư̆m pơm che pĕng iŏk brai jơk 'brê hơhĭm, 'brê gôh, tơ kơpal che 'bui se noh sĭt dônh pơm rup chêrubim."
"Also he made in front of the temple two pillars thirty-five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.","Gah anăp hnam akŭm, sư man 'bar tŏ jrăng, kơjung pêng-jĭt pơđăm hơgăt, kơ̆l jrăng pơđăm hơgăt minh pôm jrăng."
"He made wreaths of chainwork, as in the inner sanctuary, and put them on top of the pillars; and he made one hundred pomegranates, and put them on the wreaths of chainwork.","Sư kư̆m pơm glang thoi rơbưn, đăng tơ kơpal kơ̆l jrăng păng pơm minh-hrĕng tŏ plei gărnăt man klep tơ glang noh."
"Then he set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand and the other on the left; he called the name of the one on the right hand Jachin, and the name of the one on the left Boaz.","Sư pơdơ̆ng jrăng noh 'bơ̆t anăp Hnam akŭm, minh pôm jrăng gah gơal, minh pôm jrăng gah yă-nơ̆m; anăn jrăng gah gơal noh Jakin păng jrăng gah yă-nơ̆m noh krao anăn Bôas."
"Moreover he made a bronze altar: twenty cubits was its length, twenty cubits its width, and ten cubits its height.","Sư pơm chơnang soi hăm kong, tor kơjung 'bar-jĭt hơgăt, wơ̆l 'bar-jĭt hơgăt, kơjung mơjĭt hơgăt."
"Then he made the Sea of cast bronze, ten cubits from one brim to the other; it was completely round. Its height was five cubits, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference.","Sư hling minh pôm Bơng hăm kong, wĭl hơpôm dang ăi đơ̆ng âu truh tơ to mơjĭt hơgăt, jrŭ sư pơđăm hơgăt; sư pơtŏ tăp dăr pêng-jĭt hơgăt."
"And under it was the likeness of oxen encircling it all around, ten to a cubit, all the way around the Sea. The oxen were cast in two rows, when it was cast.","Ala gơnăp bơng đei rup rơmo tơno, rim kơ minh hơgăt đei rup rơmo mơjĭt tŏ hling 'bar trong, hling kơtă hơdai bơng"
"It stood on twelve oxen: three looking toward the north, three looking toward the west, three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; the Sea was set upon them, and all their back parts pointed inward.","Bơng dan kơpal mơjĭt-'bar tŏ rup rơmo, pêng tŏ tơwih muh măt tơ gah yă-nơ̆m, pêng tŏ tơwih muh măt tơ gah bơmơ̆t, pêng tŏ tơwih muh măt tơ gah gơal păng pêng tŏ rup rơmo noh tơwih muh măt tơ gah hơlĕch rŏng tơwih tơ lăm."

"He also made ten lavers, and put five on the right side and five on the left, to wash in them; such things as they offered for the burnt offering they would wash in them, but the Sea was for the priests to wash in.","Sư kư̆m đei pơm mơjĭt tŏ bơng iĕ, wă ôp hơrao dan pơđăm tŏ gah gơal, pơđăm tŏ gah yă-nơ̆m, wă ôp dôm lu tơmam soi 'buh; bơng tih wă lê̆ kơ lu 'bok soi ôp hơrao tơ noh"
"And he made ten lampstands of gold according to their design, and set them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left.","Sư pơm mơjĭt tŏ jơ̆ng kơđeng hăm maih kiơ̆ kơ đei pơkă; na tah sư tơ lăm hnam akŭm, pơđăm tŏ gah gơal, pơđăm tŏ gah yă-nơ̆m."
"He also made ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left. And he made one hundred bowls of gold.","Sư kư̆m pơm mơjĭt tŏ gơ'bang, tah lăm hnam akŭm, pơđăm tŏ gah gơal, pơđăm tŏ gah yă-nơ̆m, kư̆m đei pơm minh-hrĕng tŏ kơlăm păng maih wă mong pham."
"Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court and doors for the court; and he overlaid these doors with bronze.","Sư kư̆m đei man cham ăn kơ 'bok soi păng cham să, lu 'măng kơ cham să na lôm hăm kong rim kơ 'măng noh."
"He set the Sea on the right side, toward the southeast.","Sư lê̆ bơng tih gah gơal 'bơ̆t mum gah tơklă hơlĕch gơal."
"Then Huram made the pots and the shovels and the bowls. So Huram finished doing the work that he was to do for King Solomon for the house of God","Huram kư̆m man gŏ tah ngar, gơ'bênh păng pơnhan tô. Huram pơm keh tôm dôm tơdrong mă đơ̆ng pơtao Sôlômôn jao ăn kơ sư lăm hnam Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei"

"So all the work that Solomon had done for the house of the LORD was finished; and Solomon brought in the things which his father David had dedicated: the silver and the gold and all the furnishings.

"indeed it came to pass, when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD, and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised the LORD, saying: “For He is good, For His mercy endures forever,” that the house, the house of the LORD, was filled with a cloud","Lu bơngai hlôm keng hăm lu bơngai hơri hơdai minh pôm nơ̆r tơ'nguơ̆ hrơ̆p hrơ̆p, na hơri bơnê ư-ang kơ Kră Yang, lu sư hơri hơdai hăm re keng, ot preh chhar reh brŏ dung hăm lu brŏ nai hơri ư-ang kơ Kră Yang khan: “Sư 'lơ̆ng 'mêm mơnat iơ̆m dim Sư oei oei ling-lang,” Kơplah noh hnam Kră Yang đei hơmơ̆l gom"

The priests sounded trumpets opposite them, while all Israel stood.","Lu 'bok soi dơ̆ng kơtă 'bơ̆t anih kơdih; lu bơngai Lêwi chĕp brŏ hơri bơnê kơ Kră Yang, mă đơ̆ng Đawit pơm sơ̆ wă kơkuh bơnê kơ Kră Yang păng hơri ư-ang kơ Sư: “Tơpă tơdrong Sư 'mêm mơnat oei oei ling-lang.” Lu 'bok soi hlôm keng dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp bơngai Lêwi păng đĭ-đăng kon pơlei bơngai Isơrael iung dang dơ̆ng."
"Furthermore Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that was in front of the house of the LORD; for there he offered burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the fat.","Sôlômôn 'măn lê̆ minh anih tŏk-bŏk cham 'bơ̆t anăp hnam akŭm Kră Yang; tơ noh boih mă sư pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'buh păng rơmă pơm tơmam soi kơ tơdrong hiôk-hian, yua kơ lu chơnang soi păng kong mă đêl Sôlômôn pơm noh ưh kơ mah wă dan đĭ lu tơmam soi 'buh, tơmam soi phe 'ba păng rơmă."
"At that time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly from the entrance of Hamath to the Brook of Egypt.","Kơplah noh Sôlômôn păng đĭ-đăng kon pơlei Isơrael, lu sư minh tơpôl lơ tơpă năm đơ̆ng tơring Lêbô Hamat truh tơ thong Êyiptơ, pơm giĕng lăm tơpơh năr."
"And on the eighth day they held a sacred assembly, for they observed the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.","Truh năr mă tơhngam, lu sư akŭm tih dêh, yua kơ lu sư pơm giĕng pơyơ̆r chơnang soi lăm tơpơh năr păng pơm giĕng hmă kư̆m tơpơh năr."
"On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the good that the LORD had done for David, for Solomon, and for His people Israel.","Năr 'bar-jĭt pêng khei tơpơh, sư ăn kơ kon pơlei wih brŏk tơ anih kơdih, jơhngơ̆m lu sư chơt hiôk păng 'nă hal, yua kơ Kră Yang đei ăn boih tơdrong 'lơ̆ng kơ Đawit, kơ Sôlômôn păng ăn kơ kon pơlei pơla Isơrael Sư."
"Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD and the king’s house; and Solomon successfully accomplished all that came into his heart to make in the house of the LORD and in his own house.","Lăp Sôlômôn pơm keh hnam Kră Yang păng hnam pơtao; mă tôm tơdrong jang kiơ Sôlômôn hơmet wă pơm lăm hnam Kră Yang păng lăm hnam pơtao sư, sư pơm keh đang đĭ boih."
"Then the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him: “I have heard your prayer, and have chosen this place for Myself as a house of sacrifice.","Lăm măng noh Kră Yang pơdah Sư kơ Sôlômôn păng khan: “Inh kơtơ̆ng boih nơ̆r ih krao khan păng Inh kư̆m rơih boih anih 'nâu wă pơm hnam pơyơ̆r tơmam soi kơ Inh."
"When I shut up heaven and there is no rain, or command the locusts to devour the land, or send pestilence among My people","Mưh Inh tang đĭ plĕnh ti, ưh kơ ăn 'mi jur, dah ăn kơ lep 'ba truh kăp sa lu hơnik hơnan păng dah ăn tơdrong lôch hơbuh truh tơ kon pơlei Inh"
"if My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land.","Tơdah kon pơlei pơla Inh, đe krao lu sư kon Inh, drap bon kơkuh, krao khan, chơchă Inh păng tơbral achăng lê̆ trong kơnê̆ lei Inh oei kơpal plĕnh ti gô mơ̆ng, mơnat ăn huay pă jô̆ yoch lu sư păng ăn teh lu sư thoi đêl."
"Now My eyes will be open and My ears attentive to prayer made in this place.","Măt Inh gô lăng păng đon Inh gô pơgling mơ̆ng nơ̆r krao khan đơ̆ng anih 'nâu."
"For now I have chosen and sanctified this house, that My name may be there forever; and My eyes and My heart will be there perpetually.","Inh rơih iŏk boih păng ăn kơ hnam âu jing rơgoh ăn kơ anăn Inh oei ling-lang; măt păng jơhngơ̆m đon Inh kư̆m gô oei mơ̆ng lăng tơ noh khŏm khŏm."
"As for you, if you walk before Me as your father David walked, and do according to all that I have commanded you, and if you keep My statutes and My judgments","Bĕ ih, tơdah ih yak năm 'bơ̆t anăp Inh rok thoi 'bă ih, Đawit đei pơm, pơm kiơ̆ dôm tơdrong Inh athei pơkă kơ sư, wei răk khôi juăt păng nơ̆r Inh tơtă"
"then I will establish the throne of your kingdom, as I covenanted with David your father, saying, ‘You shall not fail to have a man as ruler in Israel.’","na Inh gô ăn kơ dêh char pơtao Ih pran kơjăp thoi nơ̆r Inh pơkă pơgơ̆p hăm 'bă ih, Đawit thoi âu: Lăm adrĕch Isơrael ưh kơ'bah bơngai pơgơ̆r Isơrael."
"“But if you turn away and forsake My statutes and My commandments which I have set before you, and go and serve other gods, and worship them","“Mă-lei tơdah iĕm weh trong plơ̆ng, achăng lê̆ tơdrong juăt păng nơ̆r Inh tơtă mă đei ăn kơ lu iĕm, na jang păng kơkuh kơ yang kơnê̆"
"then I will uproot them from My land which I have given them; and this house which I have sanctified for My name I will cast out of My sight, and will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples.","lei Inh gô buch hŭt lê̆ lu iĕm đơ̆ng lăm teh đak mă Inh đei ăn kơ lu iĕm; Inh gô achăng lê̆ hnam akŭm âu đơ̆ng anăp Inh, hnam mă Inh 'măn lê̆ 'lơ̆ng rơgoh kơ Anăn Inh boih, Inh gô ăn kơ sư jing nơ̆r đe pơđơ̆k pơjăm pơjuă lăm kon pơlei nai."
"“And as for this house, which is exalted, everyone who passes by it will be astonished and say, ‘Why has the LORD done thus to this land and this house?’","Hnam 'nâu mă khan kơjung rŏ dang yơ, dah đei bu yak rok noh 'bôh hlĭch na jet! “Yua kơ kiơ Kră Yang pơm kơ char 'nâu păng hnam 'nâu thoi noh?”"
"Then they will answer, ‘Because they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and embraced other gods, and worshiped them and served them; therefore He has brought all this calamity on them.’ ”","Na đe tơl thoi âu: ‘Yua kơ lu sư achăng lê̆ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei 'bok yă lu sư, Tơ'ngla mă chông tơlĕch lu sư đơ̆ng dêh char Êyiptơ păng yua kơ lu sư kiơ̆ yang nai, kơkuh păng jang ăn kơ lu yang noh, lei na Kră Yang ăn tơdrong truh răm 'nâu tơ lu sư.’ ”"
"It came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the house of the LORD and his own house","Kơtĕch kơ 'bar-jĭt sơnăm đơ̆ng rŏng kơ Sôlômôn pơm man hnam Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei păng hnam pơtao sư kơdih keh đang boih"
"that the cities which Hiram had given to Solomon, Solomon built them; and he settled the children of Israel there.","na Sôlômôn kư̆m pơdơ̆ng ming lu pơlei mă Hiram pơtao đe Tirơ đei asong ăn boih kơ sư păng sư ăn kơ lu kon pơlei Isơrael oei pơm pơlei tơ noh."
"And Solomon went to Hamath Zobah and seized it.","Sôlômôn năm blah pơlei Hamat Sôba jei sư."
"He also built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the storage cities which he built in Hamath.","Sư pơm pơlei Tatmôr lăm char glă păng pơm pơjing lu pơlei wă pơm anih mong tah tơmam lăm Hamat."
"He built Upper Beth Horon and Lower Beth Horon, fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars","Sư kư̆m pơm pơjing ming pơlei Bêt Hôron Kơpơ̆ng păng Bêt Hôrôn Ala, Pơm kơđông đei dur man kơjăp đei 'măng jang păng đei chơkăl"

"All the people who were left of the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who were not of Israel","Đĭ-đăng bơngai mă oei arih răi lăm lu kon pơlei Hêtit, Amôrit, Pêrisit, Hêwit păng Jêbus, ưh kơ trŏ kơ adrĕch Isơrael"
"that is, their descendants who were left in the land after them, whom the children of Israel did not destroy—from these Solomon raised forced labor, as it is to this day.","lu adrĕch adrung lu đe âu lu sư oei arih răi lăm char mă lu bơngai Isơrael tim mă pơlôch đĭ, na Sôlômôn rôp lu sư pơm đĭch dĭng truh dang ei."
"But Solomon did not make the children of Israel servants for his work. Some were men of war, captains of his officers, captains of his chariots, and his cavalry.","Mă-lei lu bơngai Isơrael, Sôlômôn ưh kơ đei rôp bu pơm đĭch, lu sư pơm linh, pơm yŏng pơgơ̆r, wei-lăng gre aseh păng lu linh hao aseh."
"And others were chiefs of the officials of King Solomon: two hundred and fifty, who ruled over the people.","Pơtao Sôlômôn kư̆m đei minh-hrĕng pơđăm-jĭt 'nu bơngai bơ̆jang, wei-lăng pơgơ̆r lu kon pơlei jang"
"Now Solomon brought the daughter of Pharaoh up from the City of David to the house he had built for her, for he said, “My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places to which the ark of the LORD has come are holy.”","Sôlômôn ba kon adruh pơtao Pharaôn đơ̆ng pơlei Đawit năm oei tơ hnam pơtao mă sư đei pơm ăn boih; yua kơ sư khan: Akăn inh ưh kơ oei lăm hnam pơtao Đawit, pơtao đe Isơrael yua kơ tơ anih ayơ Hom Kră Yang truh jing anih 'lơ̆ng rơgoh."
"Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of the LORD which he had built before the vestibule","Sôlômôn pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'buh ăn kơ Kră Yang tơ kơpal chơnang soi Kră Yang mă sư đei pơm 'bơ̆t kơdeng anăp 'măng hnam akŭm."
"according to the daily rate, offering according to the commandment of Moses, for the Sabbaths, the New Moons, and the three appointed yearly feasts—the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles.","Sư pơyơ̆r rim năr kiơ̆ kơ Môis pơkă boih pơyơ̆r lăm năr giĕng Sa'bat, năr khei tơ'bang păng pêng kơ̆m giĕng lăm sơnăm noh lu năr giĕng sa 'bĕng ưh kơ đei 'Buih pông, kơ̆m giĕng phĕ kĕch, năr giĕng Bơsŭn."
"And, according to the order of David his father, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their service, the Levites for their duties (to praise and serve before the priests) as the duty of each day required, and the gatekeepers by their divisions at each gate; for so David the man of God had commanded.","Kiơ̆ thoi Đawit 'bă sư, tơtă, sư asong tơdrong jang ăn kơ lu 'bok soi kiơ̆ kơ tơdrong jang khŭl lu sư, jao kơ khŭl bơngai Lêwi hat hơri ư-ang păng bơ̆jang tơgŭm lu 'bok soi, jang kiơ̆ tơdrong jang rim năr; tơ rim kơ 'măng jang Sư kư̆m đei ăn kơ khŭl bơngai gak 'măng jang, yua kơ 'nâu nơ̆r Đawit tơtă, bơngai Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei."
"They did not depart from the command of the king to the priests and Levites concerning any matter or concerning the treasuries.","Nơ̆r pơtao đei tơtă kơ lu 'bok soi bơngai Lêwi gah tôm tơdrong jang mă khan tơ hnam mong mŭk tơmam athei jang mă 'lơ̆ng."
"Now all the work of Solomon was well-ordered from the day of the foundation of the house of the LORD until it was finished. So the house of the LORD was completed.","Thoi noh đĭ-đăng tơdrong jang Sôlômôn đei pơm boih, đơ̆ng pơm tơiung hnam Kră Yang dĭng keh đang; pơm hnam Kră Yang keh đang boih."
"Then Solomon went to Ezion Geber and Elath on the seacoast, in the land of Edom.","Na Sôlômôn năm tơ pơlei Êsiôn Gêber păng pơlei Êlat tơ cheng đak dơsĭ, lăm dêh char Eđôm."
"And Hiram sent him ships by the hand of his servants, and servants who knew the sea. They went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and acquired four hundred and fifty talents of gold from there, and brought it to King Solomon.","Hiram gơih ăn bơngai jang sư chĕp ba duk hăm bơngai juăt kơ wơ̆r duk lăm đak dơsĭ; lu sư năm hơdai bơngai jang Sôlômôn năm tơ Ôphir, đơ̆ng noh lu sư chĕp ba ăn kơ Sôlômôn mơjĭt-tơdrâu tâna maih."
"Now when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to Jerusalem to test Solomon with hard questions, having a very great retinue, camels that bore spices, gold in abundance, and precious stones; and when she came to Solomon, she spoke with him about all that was in her heart.","Wă pơtao drŏ-kăn dêh char Seba kơtơ̆ng đe ư-ang kơ Sôlômôn, na sư năm truh tơ Jêrusalem, wă pơpơn pơlong lăng Sôlômôn; yă pơtao chông lu đĭch đam bơngai awih awăn lơlap, đei lu lăk-đa chơ pơgang 'bâu phu, đei maih lơ păng tơno gĭt; sư năm tơ Sôlômôn, roi tôm dôm tơdrong mă sư đei tơchĕng lăm kơ̆l sư kơdih."
"So Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing so difficult for Solomon that he could not explain it to her.","Sôlômôn tơl tơwih đĭ dôm tơdrong yă pơtao jet, ưh kơ đei nơ̆r jet ayơ mă hlơp tơnat mă ưh kơ gơh tơl kơ yă."
"And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built","Yă pơtao Seba 'bôh tơdrong hơgei Sôlômôn, lăng hnam sư đei pơm boih"
"the food on his table, the seating of his servants, the service of his waiters and their apparel, his cupbearers and their apparel, and his entryway by which he went up to the house of the LORD, there was no more spirit in her.","lu tơmam sa tơ gơ'bang, tang-dŏ lu yŏng pơgơ̆r sư hơ-oei, lu bơngai awih awăn sư hơbĕn ao lu sư hrŭk, lu bơngai awih awăn ăn đak nhă hơbĕn ao tai lu sư hrŭk păng dôm lu tơmam soi 'buh pơyơ̆r lăm hnam Kră Yang, na yă pơtao Seba lăng hlĭch ưh pă băt pơma liơ."
"Then she said to the king: “It was a true report which I heard in my own land about your words and your wisdom.","Yă pơtao khan kơ pơtao: Tơdrong inh kơtơ̆ng đe roi gah ih lăm char nhôn tơdrong nơ̆r ih pơma hơgei păng tơdrong jang ih hơgei tơpă."
"However I did not believe their words until I came and saw with my own eyes; and indeed the half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me. You exceed the fame of which I heard.","Mă-lei adrol kơ inh tam mă truh tơ âu tam mă 'bôh tơm măt dôm tơdrong 'nâu, lei inh ưh kơ lui ôh kơ nơ̆r lu sư roi noh; lei na, 'nâu đe roi kơ inh băt ưh tam mă đei minh puăt ôh tơdrong ih hơgei; sĭt tơpă tơdrong hơgei ih tih hloh kơ inh kơtơ̆ng."
"Happy are your men and happy are these your servants, who stand continually before you and hear your wisdom!","Pŭn hiôk dêh kơ lu bơngai pơgơ̆r oei hăm ih, lu đam ih, rim năr jang 'bơ̆t anăp ih, mơ̆ng nơ̆r 'bơ̆r đon hơgei ih"
"Blessed be the LORD your God, who delighted in you, setting you on His throne to be king for the LORD your God! Because your God has loved Israel, to establish them forever, therefore He made you king over them, to do justice and righteousness.”","Trŏ bơnê ư-ang tơpă kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ih, Sư lăp đon kơ ih, ăn kơ ih pơm pơtao hơ-oei 'bơ̆t tang-dŏ pơtao Sư wă pơm pơtao ăn kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ih!

"And she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, spices in great abundance, and precious stones; there never were any spices such as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.","Đơ̆ng noh sư ăn kơ pơtao minh-hrĕng 'bar-jĭt talâng maih, tơmam 'bâu phu lơ tơpă păng tơmo gĭt, tam biơh đei tơmam 'bâu phu thoi noh đơ̆ng sơ̆ thoi tơmam 'bâu phu đơ̆ng thoi yă pơtao char Seba ăn kơ pơtao Sôlômôn."
"Also, the servants of Hiram and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, brought algum wood and precious stones.","Lu bơngai đơ̆ng Hiram păng lu bơngai đơ̆ng Sôlômôn wơh kư̆m đei chơ 'long kơte păng chơ tơmo gĭt đơ̆ng char Ôphir."
"And the king made walkways of the algum wood for the house of the LORD and for the king’s house, also harps and stringed instruments for singers; and there were none such as these seen before in the land of Judah.","Pơtao yua 'long kơte noh pơm kung lăm hnam akŭm Kră Yang păng lăm hnam pơtao, hăm pơm brŏ dung, tĭng-nĭng reh ăn kơ khŭl hơri; đơ̆ng sơ̆ đe ưh tam 'bôh ôh tơ lăm dêh char Juđa đei thoi noh."
"Now King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all she desired, whatever she asked, much more than she had brought to the king. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.","Pơtao Sôlômôn ăn kơ yă pơtao char Seba tơmam kiơ̆ thoi sư apinh hơpơi wă, lơ hloh kơ tơmam sư đei pơyơ̆r ăn kơ pơtao Sôlômôn, đơ̆ng noh yă pơtao păng lu đĭch đam sư wih brŏk tơ dêh char sư kơdih."
"The weight of gold that came to Solomon yearly was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold","Maih mă pơtao Sôlômôn đei iŏk lăm rim sơnăm tơdrâu-hrĕng tơdrâu-jĭt tơdrâu talâng."
"besides what the traveling merchants and traders brought. And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.","Ưh kơ jô̆ lu maih mă đơ̆ng lu mơdro pơyơ̆r, mă hu maih đơ̆ng pơtao Arâp dah đơ̆ng lu yŏng pơgơ̆r char năm ba ăn kơ pơtao Sôlômôn."
"And King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred shekels of hammered gold went into each shield.","Pơtao Sôlômôn tơtang maih noh pơm 'bar-hrĕng hlak khêl tih, minh hlak khêl trăp tơdrâu-hrĕng beka maih."
"He also made three hundred shields of hammered gold; three hundred shekels of gold went into each shield. The king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.","Păng pêng-hrĕng tŏ khêl iĕ hăm maih, minh hlak khêl trăp pêng-hrĕng beka maih; na pơtao 'măn khêl noh tơ lăm hnam Bri kơdrơ̆ng char Liban."
"Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.","Pơtao kư̆m pơm minh pôm tang-dŏ tih hăm bơla đơ̆ng noh bah hăm maih rơgoh."
"The throne had six steps, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne; there were armrests on either side of the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the armrests.","Tang-dŏ noh đei tơdrâu kơnao păng jơ̆ng juă tơklep hăm tang-dŏ; kư̆m đei anih hơgơn ti pah âu pah to kơ anih hơ-oei, cheng noh đei man 'bar tŏ rup dăm-brang."
"Twelve lions stood there, one on each side of the six steps; nothing like this had been made for any other kingdom.","Kŭm đei man mơjĭt-'bar tŏ dăm-brang 'bơ̆t tơdrâu kơnao gah 'ma păng gah 'ngiĕo; ưh kơ đei dêh char ayơ mă pơm tang-dŏ thoi noh."
"All King Solomon’s drinking vessels were gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Not one was silver, for this was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon.","Lu kơchŏk pơnhan yua wă huch nhă tă kơ pơm hăm maih ngăl păng đĭ lu tơmam yua lăm hnam pơtao Bri kơdrơ̆ng char Liban kư̆m pơm hăm maih rơgoh; lăm chăl Sôlômôn, đe ưh kơ gĭt ôh hu"
"For the king’s ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Hiram. Once every three years the merchant ships came, bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and monkeys.","yua kơ pơtao đei khŭl duk tŏk tơ Tarêsis, hơdai hăm đĭch đam Hiram; păng pêng sơnăm minh wơ̆t duk juăt kơ chơ ba hu maih, bơla, kuĕnh păng 'bok bul."
"So King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.","Thoi noh boih na pơtao Sôlômôn đe ang hloh kơ lu pơtao kơpal teh âu kơ tơdrong sư mơdrŏng păng tơdrong sư hơgei."
"And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.","Đĭ-đăng lu pơtao lăm teh 'maih tơ'bơ̆p pơtao Sôlômôn, wă mơ̆ng đon gơh hơgei đei đơ̆ng Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ăn lăm kơ̆l đon tơchĕng sư."
"Each man brought his present: articles of silver and gold, garments, armor, spices, horses, and mules, at a set rate year by year.","Lăm rim sơnăm, lu sư năm tơ'bơ̆p chĕp ba tơmam pơyơ̆r, tơmam đe pơm păng hu maih, hơbĕn ao, tơmam tơblah tơmam 'bâu phu, aseh păng aseh iĕ."
"Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king at Jerusalem.","Pơtao Sôlômôn đei puăn-rơbâu tŏ hơdrong aseh păng hnam tah gre aseh, kư̆m đei mơjĭt-'bar rơbâu aseh, tơ lăm lu pơlei tah gre aseh păng tah hơdai hăm sư tơ lăm pơlei tih Jêrusalem."
"So he reigned over all the kings from the River to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt.","Sư pơgơ̆r lu pơtao, iŏk đơ̆ng đak Krong Ơphrat truh tơ char Philistin păng dĭng truh tơ hơdral hăm char Êyiptơ."
"The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedar trees as abundant as the sycamores which are in the lowland.","Lăm pơlei Jêrusalem pơtao lăng kơ hu thoi tơmo hơga păng 'long hơngo hla iĕ lơ thoi 'long kơphŏk chăt lăm groi Sephela."
"And they brought horses to Solomon from Egypt and from all lands.","Pơtao Sôlômôn răt aseh đơ̆ng dêh Êyiptơ păng đơ̆ng dêh char nai."
"Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?","Đĭ-đăng tơdrong jang Sôlômôn pơm pơjing đơ̆ng blŭng truh tơ tôch đei chih tơ lăm sơ̆p hla bơar hơ'mon Nathan bơngai khan lê̆ adrol, lăm hla bơar Ahija bơngai khan lê̆ adrol, bơngai Silô, chih lăm sơ̆p hla bơar Iđô, 'bok mă đei khan lê̆ adrol gah tơdrong Jêrôbôam, kon drŏ-nglo Nêbat."
"Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.","Sôlômôn pơgơ̆r đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael lăm pơlei tih Jêrusalem lăm puăn-jĭt sơnăm."
"Then Solomon rested with his fathers, and was buried in the City of David his father. And Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.","Sôlômôn lôch oei hơdai hăm lu 'bok sư, đe 'bŭ lăm pơlei Đawit, 'bă sư; Rêhôbôam, kon drŏ-nglo sư iung pơm pơtao pơgơ̆r pơtrơp sư."
"And Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had gone to Shechem to make him king.","Rêhôbôam năm tơ pơlei Sichem, yua kơ đĭ-đăng lu bơngai Isơrael truh boih tơ Pơlei Sichem wă pôk sư pơm pơtao."
"So it happened, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard it (he was in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of King Solomon), that Jeroboam returned from Egypt.","Lăp Jêrôbôam, kon drŏ-nglo Nêbat kơtơ̆ng tơdrong noh, sư oei oei lăm dêh char Êyiptơ yua kơ sư kơdâu ôn kơ Sôlômôn, na sư wih brŏk đơ̆ng char Êyiptơ."
"Then they sent for him and called him. And Jeroboam and all Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying","Đe wơh bơngai năm krao sư; na Jêrôbôam păng lu bơngai Isơrael năm khan kơ Rêhôbôam."
"“Your father made our yoke heavy; now therefore, lighten the burdensome service of your father and his heavy yoke which he put on us, and we will serve you.”","“'Bă ih tơpŭ ăn kơ lu nhôn tơdrong jang 'long ăt trăp dêh, dang ei ăn kơ lu nhôn pŭ 'long ăt phiơl 'biơ̆ bĕ, na lu nhôn gô bơ̆jang kơ ih.”"
"So he said to them, “Come back to me after three days.” And the people departed.","Sư tơl đe noh khan: “Pă pêng năr, lu iĕm năm hơlơ̆k tơ inh dơ̆ng.” Lu kon pơlei wih brŏk."
"Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who stood before his father Solomon while he still lived, saying, “How do you advise me to answer these people?”","Pơtao Rêhôbôam khan pơđâu hăm lu kră bơngai mă juăt kơ jang hăm 'bă sư Sôlômôn kơplah oei arih: “Lu iĕm tơchĕng inh athei pơma păng drơ̆ng lu kon pơlei âu thoi yơ?”"
"And they spoke to him, saying, “If you are kind to these people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be your servants forever.”","Lu kră bơngai wei-lăng kon pơlei khan kơ pơtao thoi âu: “Tơdah ih pơm hiôk kơ kon pơlei pơla, oei sa 'lơ̆ng hơiă hăm lu sư, đei jơhngơ̆m hiôk pơma drơ̆ng rơngơp hăm lu sư, lei lu kon pơlei pơla âu bơ̆jang awih awăn kơ ih ling-lang.”"
"But he rejected the advice which the elders had given him, and consulted the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him.","Mă-lei Rêhôbôam ưh kơ kiơ̆ ôh nơ̆r lu kră đei pơđâu, na chă đon pơđâu hăm lu bơngai kră mơlôh 'lŏ sư pơhnŏng kơchŏng sư bơhnơr, mă oei bơ̆jang kơ sư."
"And he said to them, “What advice do you give? How should we answer this people who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Lighten the yoke which your father put on us’?”","Pơtao jet: “Lu kon pơlei âu apinh ăn kơ lu nhôn tôi 'long ăt phiơl 'biơ̆ đơ̆ng 'bă inh ăn kơ lu nhôn trăp dêh; lei na iĕm tơchĕng lăng ăn kơ inh wă pơm liơ tơl hăm lu sư?”"
"Then the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, “Thus you should speak to the people who have spoken to you, saying, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you make it lighter on us’—thus you shall say to them: ‘My little finger shall be thicker than my father’s waist!","Lu kră mơlôh, 'lơ̆p 'lŏ sư hơdai tơl sư: “Ih athei tơl lu kon pơlei lu bơngai mă apinh ih khan: “'Bă ih ăn kơ lu nhôn jang thoi tôi 'long ăt trăp dêh, apinh Ih ăn kơ lu nhôn tôi phiơl 'biơ̆; ih tơl lu sư. Hơnglâu dĕng inh tih hloh kơ kơiĕng 'bă inh."
"And now, whereas my father put a heavy yoke on you, I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scourges!’ ”","Na, 'bă inh ăn kơ lu iĕm tôi 'long ăt trăp dang noh boih, na inh gô ăn kơ iĕm tôi trăp hloh kơ noh dơ̆ng; 'bă inh đei teh phak lu iĕm hăm sơnguĕt, inh gô phak lu iĕm hăm hơguăt."
"So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had directed, saying, “Come back to me the third day.”","Pêng năr đơ̆ng rŏng, Jêrôbôam păng đĭ kon pơlei năm dơ̆ng tơ Rêhôbôam kiơ̆ thoi pơtao đei pơkă pă pêng năr athei năm hơlơ̆k tơ inh âu dơ̆ng."
"Then the king answered them roughly. King Rehoboam rejected the advice of the elders","Pơtao Rêhôbôam tơl kon pơlei hăm nơ̆r arăng, ưh pă wă kiơ̆ boih kơ nơ̆r lu kră pơđâu"
"and he spoke to them according to the advice of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scourges!”","Kiơ̆ kơ nơ̆r lu kră mơlôh pơđâu, na pơtao khan kơ lu kon pơlei: 'Bă inh ăn kơ lu iĕm tôi 'long ăt trăp dang noh, inh gô ăn kơ lu iĕm tôi 'long ăt trăp hloh kơ noh dơ̆ng, 'bă inh teh phak lu iĕm hăm sơnguĕt, inh gô teh phak iĕm hăm hơguăt.”"
"So the king did not listen to the people; for the turn of events was from God, that the LORD might fulfill His word, which He had spoken by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.","Thoi noh, pơtao ưh kơ wă mơ̆ng kiơ̆ kon pơlei, yua kơ tơdrong noh trŏ thoi Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei khan wă kơ pơsĭt kơ nơ̆r Kră Yang đei khan kơ Ahija bơngai pơlei Silô khan kơ Jêrôbôam kon drŏ-nglo Nêbat."
"Now when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, saying: “What share have we in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. Every man to your tents, O Israel! Now see to your own house, O David!” So all Israel departed to their tents.","Wă đĭ-đăng kon pơlei Isơrael 'bôh pơtao Rêhôbôam ưh pă iŏk nơ̆r lu sư boih, lu sư tơl pơtao. “Lu nhôn hăm đei kiơ lăm Đawit?

"But Rehoboam reigned over the children of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah.","Mă-lei kon pơlei Isơrael mă oei lăm lu pơlei Juđa, Rêhôbôam oei pơgơ̆r lu sư."
"Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was in charge of revenue; but the children of Israel stoned him with stones, and he died. Therefore King Rehoboam mounted his chariot in haste to flee to Jerusalem.","Pơtao Rêhôbôam wơh Adôniram, bơngai wei-lăng pơgŏ lu bơngai jang trăp, năm tơ kon pơlei Isơrael.

"So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.","Lei na adrĕch Isơrael areh blah hăm adrĕch Đawit dĭng truh tơ dang ei."
"Now when Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled from the house of Judah and Benjamin one hundred and eighty thousand chosen men who were warriors, to fight against Israel, that he might restore the kingdom to Rehoboam.","Rêhôbôam wih brŏk tơ Jêrusalem, akŭm pơđĭ lu linh bơngai Juđa păng Bênjamin, đei minh-hrĕng tơhngam-jĭt rơbâu 'nu wă tơblah hăm lu bơngai Isơrael, wă kơ pơdrâu iŏk dêh char ăn kơ Rêhôbôam dơ̆ng."
"But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying","Mă-lei đei nơ̆r Kră Yang khan kơ Sêmaia, bơngai Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei."
"“Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying","“Khan bĕ kơ Rêhôbôam kon drŏ-nglo Sôlômôn pơtao đe Juđa păng đĭ-đăng lu bơngai Isơrael oei lăm dêh char Juđa hăm Bênjamin."
"‘Thus says the LORD: “You shall not go up or fight against your brethren! Let every man return to his house, for this thing is from Me.” ’ ” Therefore they obeyed the words of the LORD, and turned back from attacking Jeroboam.","Kră Yang khan thoi âu: Lu iĕm lê̆ kơ năm tơblah hăm lu 'nhŏng oh iĕm ôh, wih brŏk tơ hnam iĕm bĕ, yua kơ tơdrong 'nâu lĕch đơ̆ng Inh.” Thoi noh lu sư chu kơ nơ̆r Kră Yang khan, wih brŏk kơdih ưh kơ đei năm tơblah hăm Jêrôbôam ôh."
"So Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah.","Rêhôbôam oei lăm pơlei Jêrusalem pơdơ̆ng pơjing pơlei tih kơjăp lăm char Juđa."
"And he built Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa","Sư man pơdơ̆ng pơlei Betlehem, Êtam, Têkôa"
"Beth Zur, Sochoh, Adullam","pơlei Bêt Sur, Sôkô, Ađulam"
"Gath, Mareshah, Ziph","pơlei Gat Marêsa, pơlei Sip"
"Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah","pơlei Adôraim, Lakis, Asêka"
"Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and Benjamin, fortified cities.","Pơlei Sôra, Aijalôn păng pơlei Hêbrôn. Lu pơlei mă đei kơđông linh kơjăp lăm char Juđa păng lăm char Bênjamin."
"And he fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and stores of food, oil, and wine.","Sư pơm kơđông rai kơjăp tơ noh, ăn kơ lu yŏng linh oei lăm noh, tah mong tơmam sa phe 'ba, đak rơmă ôliwơ păng đak sik plei hơmu"
"Also in every city he put shields and spears, and made them very strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.","Tơ lăm rim pơlei sư đei tah đao hơlă, khêl wă pơm ăn kơ pơlei noh kơjăp tơpă, lei sư wei pơgơ̆r char Juđa hăm char Bênjamin."
"And from all their territories the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel took their stand with him.","Lu 'bok soi hăm lu bơngai Lêwi đơ̆ng jơ̆p-jang lăm char Isơrael, wih brŏk kiơ̆ Rêhôbôam"
"For the Levites left their common-lands and their possessions and came to Judah and Jerusalem, for Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them from serving as priests to the LORD.","Lu bơngai Lêwi mă achăng lê̆ pơlei hăm teh jang sa lu sư năm oei tơ char Juđa păng pơlei tih Jêrusalem, yua kơ Jêrôbôam hăm lu kon drŏ-nglo sư pơpuh lu sư, ưh pă ăn kơ lu sư pơm 'bok soi jang kơ Kră Yang dơ̆ng."
"Then he appointed for himself priests for the high places, for the demons, and the calf idols which he had made.","Jêrôbôam chă pôk pơjing lu 'bok soi sư kơdih tơ lu anih kơjung, kơ lu rup yang sư man noh bơbe tơno păng kon rơmo"
"And after the Levites left, those from all the tribes of Israel, such as set their heart to seek the LORD God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to the LORD God of their fathers.","Lăm adrĕch bơngai Isơrael, bu đei jơhngơ̆m chă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael, lu sư kiơ̆ lu bơngai Lêwi, năm tơ Jêrusalem wă pơyơ̆r tơmam soi ăn kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu 'bok sư."
"So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong for three years, because they walked in the way of David and Solomon for three years.","Lăm pêng sơnăm sư bơwei char Juđa kơjăp tơgŭm Rêhôbôam, kon drŏ-nglo Sôlômôn, jing pran kơtang; tơpă lăm pêng sơnăm noh lu sư kiơ̆ trong Đawit păng Sôlômôn."
"Then Rehoboam took for himself as wife Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, and of Abihail the daughter of Eliah the son of Jesse.","Rêhôbôam oei kơ Mahalat kon adruh Jêrimôt, sâu Đawit; sư kư̆m oei dơ̆ng kơ Abihai, kon adruh Êliap, sâu Jese."
"And she bore him children: Jeush, Shamariah, and Zaham.","Akăn sư tơpŭ ăn kơ sư lu kon drŏ-nglo, Jêrus, Sêmaria păng Saham."
"After her he took Maachah the granddaughter of Absalom; and she bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith.","Đơ̆ng rŏng, sư kư̆m rôp oei dơ̆ng Maaka kon adruh Apsalôm, akăn sư tơpŭ ăn kơ sư lu kon drŏ-nglo noh Abija, Attai, Sisa păng Sêlômit."
"Now Rehoboam loved Maachah the granddaughter of Absalom more than all his wives and his concubines; for he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and begot twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.","Rêhôbôam 'mêm kơ Maaka kon adruh Apsalôm hloh kơ lu akăn sư nai; sư đei mơjĭt-tơhngam 'nu akăn tơm păng tơdrâu-jĭt 'nu akăn kơnhŏng, Sư đei 'bar-jĭt tơhngam 'nu kon drŏ-nglo păng tơdrâu-jĭt 'nu kon drŏ-kăn."
"And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maachah as chief, to be leader among his brothers; for he intended to make him king.","Rêhôbôam pôk ăn Abija kon drŏ-nglo Maaka pơm yŏng kơdră kơ lu 'nhŏng oh sư, rơih wă ăn Abija pơtrơp pơm pơtao."
"He dealt wisely, and dispersed some of his sons throughout all the territories of Judah and Benjamin, to every fortified city; and he gave them provisions in abundance. He also sought many wives for them.","Rêhôbôam sư hơgei klah song ăn kơ lu kon drŏ-nglo sư oei tơ jơ̆p-jang kơ char Juđa păng char Bênjamin, tơ lăm lu pơlei kơjăp, asong ăn kơ lu sư tơmam sa rơkah rơkai; chă ăn kơ lu sư akăn lơ."
"Now it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom and had strengthened himself, that he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel along with him.","Wă Rêhôbôam pơgơ̆r dêh char sư pran kơjăp boih, na sư păng lu bơngai Isơrael kiơ̆ Sư achăng lê̆ ưh pă kiơ̆ khôi juăt Kră Yang."
"And it happened in the fifth year of King Rehoboam that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD","Lăm sơnăm mă pơđăm lăm chăl pơtao Rêhôbôam, yua kơ lu sư đei pơm yoch hăm Kră Yang, na Sisăk, pơtao đe Êyiptơ, tŏk blah Jêrusalem"
"with twelve hundred chariots, sixty thousand horsemen, and people without number who came with him out of Egypt—the Lubim and the Sukkiim and the Ethiopians.","chĕp ba minh-rơbâu 'bar-hrĕng gre aseh păng tơdrâu-jĭt rơbâu 'nu linh hao aseh; kư̆m đei lu linh đơ̆ng char Libia, Sukki păng char Êthiôpi tŏk hơdai đơ̆ng Êyiptơ, lơ tơpă."
"And he took the fortified cities of Judah and came to Jerusalem.","Sisăk đei blah iŏk lu pơlei tih kơjăp lăm char Juđa dĭng truh tơ pơlei tih Jêrusalem."
"Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the leaders of Judah, who were gathered together in Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, “Thus says the LORD: ‘You have forsaken Me, and therefore I also have left you in the hand of Shishak.’ ”","Sêmaia 'bok khan lê̆ adrol năm tơ Rêhôbôam păng lu bơngai pơgơ̆r char Juđa oei akŭm lăm pơlei Jêrusalem wă kơdâu ôn hli kơ Sisăk păng khan: Kră Yang khan thoi âu: “Lu iĕm achăng lê̆ Inh, lei na Inh kư̆m achăng lê̆ lu iĕm lăm ti Sisăk,”"
"So the leaders of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, “The LORD is righteous.”","Kră pơgơ̆r bơngai Isơrael păng pơtao lu sư tơjur akâu tơbral păng khan: “Kră Yang 'lơ̆ng tơpăt.”"
"Now when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, “They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance. My wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.","Wă Kră Yang 'bôh lu sư tơbral đei hloi nơ̆r Kră Yang khan kơ Samaia thoi âu: “Yua kơ lu sư tơjur akâu tơbral boih, Inh ưh pă pơlôch lu sư; mă-lei wă jah tơgŭm dŏng lu sư Inh ưh pă yua ti Sisăk tuh tơdrong Inh hil tơ pơlei Jêrusalem dơ̆ng."
"Nevertheless they will be his servants, that they may distinguish My service from the service of the kingdoms of the nations.”","Ăn kơ lu sư chu Sisăk, wă kơ lu Sư băt chu yom kơ Inh pha kơ chu kơ lu pơtao kơpal teh âu."
"So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king’s house; he took everything. He also carried away the gold shields which Solomon had made.","Sisăk pơtao đe Êyiptơ, tŏk blah Jêrusalem, iŏk đĭ tơmam gĭt đơ̆ng lăm hnam Kră Yang păng đơ̆ng lăm hnam pơtao; kư̆m iŏk lu khêl maih đơ̆ng Sôlômôn pơm."
"Then King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who guarded the doorway of the king’s house.","Pơtao Rêhôbôam pơm dơ̆ng khêl hăm kong păng pơjao ăn kơ lu yŏng pơgơ̆r gak wei-lăng 'măng jang hnam pơtao."
"And whenever the king entered the house of the LORD, the guard would go and bring them out; then they would take them back into the guardroom.","Rim wơ̆t mưh pơtao wă mơ̆t lăm hnam Kră Yang, na lu linh gah 'măng năm sơng chĕp khêl noh, đang boih tah pơdrâu lê̆ khêl noh tơ anih lu bơngai gak 'măng."
"When he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him, so as not to destroy him completely; and things also went well in Judah.","Đơ̆ng pơtao băt tơjur akâu tơbral, na Kră Yang, ưh pă hil ưh kơ đei pơrăm đĭ; tơpă kư̆m đei tơdrong 'lơ̆ng mơ̆n lăm char Juđa."
"Thus King Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem and reigned. Now Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king; and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put His name there. His mother’s name was Naamah, an Ammonitess.","Thoi noh pơtao Rêhôbôam pơm kơ sư kơdih kơjăp oei lăm pơlei Jêrusalem, Rêhôbôam 'nao puăn-jĭt mônh sơnăm kơplah sư pơm pơtao, sư pơgơ̆r lăm mơjĭt-tơpơh sơnăm lăm pơlei Jêrusalem, pơlei mă Kră Yang đei rơih iŏk đơ̆ng lăm adrĕch Isơrael, wă 'măn anăn Sư tơ noh; mĕ Rêhôbôam anăn Naama, bơngai Ammôn."
"And he did evil, because he did not prepare his heart to seek the LORD.","Rêhôbôam pơm kơnê̆, yua kơ sư ưh kơ chơchă Kră Yang ôh lăm jơhngơ̆m sư."
"The acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.","Dôm tơdrong jang Rêhôbôam pơm đơ̆ng blŭng-a truh tơ tôch đei chih lăm sơ̆p hla bơar Sêmaia bơngai khan lê̆ adrol păng Iđô bơngai roi lê̆ adrol chih, gah adrĕch 'bok sư Rêhôbôam păng Jêrôbôam tơblah băl hơnơ̆ng đĭ chăl bre sư pơgơ̆r."
"So Rehoboam rested with his fathers, and was buried in the City of David. Then Abijah his son reigned in his place.","Rêhôbôam lôch pơdơh hăm lu 'bok yă sư, 'bŭ lăm pơlei Đawit; Abija kon drŏ-nglo sư pơm pơtao pơgơ̆r pơtrơp đơ̆ng sư."
"In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah became king over Judah.","Lăm sơnăm mă mơjĭt-tơhngam chăl pơtao Jêrôbôam, Abija pơm pơtao char Juđa."
"He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.","Sư pơgơ̆r pêng sơnăm lăm pơlei tih Jêrusalem. Mĕ sư anăn Maaka kon drŏ-kăn Uriel đơ̆ng pơlei Gibêah. Đei tơdrong tơblah Abija hăm Jêrôbôam."
"Abijah set the battle in order with an army of valiant warriors, four hundred thousand choice men. Jeroboam also drew up in battle formation against him with eight hundred thousand choice men, mighty men of valor.","Abija năm tơblah chĕp ba linh, puăn-hrĕng rơbâu linh nuih pran kơtang; gah Jêrôbôam năm tơblah hăm sư chĕp ba tơhngam-hrĕng rơbâu linh, 'nâu lu linh nuih pran kơtang"
"Then Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim, which is in the mountains of Ephraim, and said, “Hear me, Jeroboam and all Israel","Abija sư dơ̆ng tơ kơpal Kông Sêmaraim lăm tơring kông groi Êphraim, na khan: “Ơ Jêrôbôam păng đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael mơ̆ng bĕ!"
"Should you not know that the LORD God of Israel gave the dominion over Israel to David forever, to him and his sons, by a covenant of salt?","Đơ̆ng tơdrong pơgơ̆p 'boh, Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael đei jao boih dêh char Isơrael kơ Đawit păng lu kon drŏ-nglo sư ling-lang hlŏng hloi boih, lu iĕm ưh kơ băt hă?"
"Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up and rebelled against his lord.","Mă-lei Jêrôbôam kon drŏ-nglo Nêbat bơngai jang kơ Sôlômôn, kon drŏ-nglo Đawit, iung tơblah hăm yŏng tơ'ngla sư kơdih"
"Then worthless rogues gathered to him, and strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and inexperienced and could not withstand them.","Lu bơngai kơnê̆ kư̆ kă năm kiơ̆ ih; tơblah hăm Rêhôbôam, kon drŏ-nglo Sôlômôn; Rêhôbôam; sư oei mơlôh, ưh kơ kĕ tơblah hăm ih."
"And now you think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD, which is in the hand of the sons of David; and you are a great multitude, and with you are the gold calves which Jeroboam made for you as gods.","Na dang ei lu iĕm tơchĕng khan kĕ mơ̆n hă tơblah hăm char mă Kră Yang đei jao ăn boih kơ lu kon Đawit?

"Have you not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made for yourselves priests, like the peoples of other lands, so that whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams may be a priest of things that are not gods?","Hăm trŏ lu iĕm pơpuh boih lu 'bok soi Kră Yang, kon sâu Arôn păng lu bơngai Lêwi?

"But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken Him; and the priests who minister to the LORD are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites attend to their duties.","Gah lu nhôn, Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu bơ̆n, lu nhôn ưh kơ đei achăng lê̆ Sư; lu 'bok soi bơ̆jang kơ Kră Yang tă kơ kon sâu Arôn păng lu bơngai Lêwi bơ̆jang tơdrong jang lu sư."
"And they burn to the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense; they also set the showbread in order on the pure gold table, and the lampstand of gold with its lamps to burn every evening; for we keep the command of the LORD our God, but you have forsaken Him.","Rim pơgê hrôih păng kơsơ̆ lu sư soh pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'buh păng pơgang 'bâu phu ăn kơ Kră Yang; lu sư kư̆m dan 'bĕng 'lơ̆ng rơgoh kơpal gơ'bang rơgoh păng kư̆m tơ̆k ŭnh kơđeng tơ rim jơ̆ng kơđeng maih wă kơ sư khơ̆ng kiơ̆ kơmăng.

"Now look, God Himself is with us as our head, and His priests with sounding trumpets to sound the alarm against you.

"But Jeroboam caused an ambush to go around behind them; so they were in front of Judah, and the ambush was behind them.","Jêrôbôam ăn boih linh sư răp wă blah tơ gah rŏng; thoi noh lu sư dơ̆ng gah anăp lu linh Juđa, mơ'nah răp blah tơ gah rŏng lu linh Juđa."
"And when Judah looked around, to their surprise the battle line was at both front and rear; and they cried out to the LORD, and the priests sounded the trumpets.","Wă lu linh Juđa 'bôh đei lu linh ayăt tơ gah anăp păng tơ gah rŏng, na lu sư ôr krao Kră Yang. Lu 'bok soi hlôm keng."
"Then the men of Judah gave a shout; and as the men of Judah shouted, it happened that God struck Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.","Lu bơngai Juđa jreo năm tơ anăp tơblah.

"And the children of Israel fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hand.","Kon pơlei Isơrael kơdâu kơ kon pơlei Juđa păng Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei jao lu kon pơlei Isơrael lăm ti lu kon pơlei Juđa."
"Then Abijah and his people struck them with a great slaughter; so five hundred thousand choice men of Israel fell slain.","Abija păng lu linh sư blah pơrăm đĭ lu bơngai Isơrael tih dêh đei pơđăm-hrĕng rơbâu linh nuih kơtang Isơrael lôch"
"Thus the children of Israel were subdued at that time; and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied on the LORD God of their fathers.","Thoi noh, kơplah noh, lu linh Isơrael thuơ răm, jei lu linh păng kon pơlei Juđa, yua kơ lu sư gơnang kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yă 'bok lu sư."
"And Abijah pursued Jeroboam and took cities from him: Bethel with its villages, Jeshanah with its villages, and Ephrain with its villages.","Abija druh blah Jêrôbôam păng blah iŏk lu pơlei tih Bethel păng lu pơlei iĕ sư pơlei Jesana păng lu pơlei iĕ sư, pơlei tih Êphrôn păng lu pơlei iĕ sư."
"So Jeroboam did not recover strength again in the days of Abijah; and the LORD struck him, and he died.","Kơplah chăl Abija oei arih, Jêrôbôam ưh pă đei pran dơ̆ng boih; Kră Yang pơrăm sư, na sư lôch."
"But Abijah grew mighty, married fourteen wives, and begot twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.","Gah Abija rai pran kơtang ling-lang, sư oei kơ mơjĭt-puăn 'nu akăn, tơpŭ kơ sư đei 'bar-jĭt 'bar 'nu kon drŏ-nglo păng mơjĭt-tơdrâu 'nu kon drŏ-kăn."
"Now the rest of the acts of Abijah, his ways, and his sayings are written in the annals of the prophet Iddo.","Lu tơdrong jang nai mă Abija jang, lu tơdrong sư pơm păng nơ̆r sư pơma, đei chih răk lăm sơ̆p hla bơar hơ'mon Iđô bơngai khan lê̆ adrol."
"So Abijah rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the City of David. Then Asa his son reigned in his place. In his days the land was quiet for ten years.","Abija lôch pơdơh oei hơdai hăm lu 'bok yă sư đe 'bŭ sư lăm pơlei Đawit, Asa kon drŏ-nglo sư iung pơgơ̆r pơtrơp sư.

"Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God","Asa oei arih 'lơ̆ng păng pơm tơpăt 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei sư"
"for he removed the altars of the foreign gods and the high places, and broke down the sacred pillars and cut down the wooden images.","Sư yuih hŭt lê̆ đĭ chơnang soi kơkuh kơ lu yang bơngai tơmoi păng tơ lăm anih kơjung, sư teh pơchah đĭ lu jrăng gơ̆ng soi păng kăl tơlơ̆ lê̆ rup yang drŏ-kăn Asêra."
"He commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to observe the law and the commandment.","Sư athei bơngai Juđa chă bĕ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei 'bok yă lu sư, kư̆m athei pơm kiơ̆ khôi juăt păng nơ̆r Kră Yang tơtă."
"He also removed the high places and the incense altars from all the cities of Judah, and the kingdom was quiet under him.","Sư kư̆m hŭt lê̆ đĭ lu jrăng gơ̆ng soi kơkuh kơ yang tơ anih kơjung păng chơnang soi đơ̆ng rim pơlei lăm char Juđa; dêh char sư pơgơ̆r đei hiôk-hian."
"And he built fortified cities in Judah, for the land had rest; he had no war in those years, because the LORD had given him rest.","Sư đei man pơjing lu pơlei kơjăp lăm char Juđa, yua kơ lăm dôm sơnăm sư pơgơ̆r dêh char sư đei hiôk-hian ưh kơ đei tơblah, Kră Yang ăn hiôk-hian kơ sư."
"Therefore he said to Judah, “Let us build these cities and make walls around them, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us, because we have sought the LORD our God; we have sought Him, and He has given us rest on every side.” So they built and prospered.","Sư khan kơ kon pơlei Juđa: “Bĕ bơ̆n pơdơ̆ng tơiung pơlei tih kơjăp, man dur tăp dăr, pơm hnam thôt gak, pơm 'măng jang, 'long chơkăl; char 'nâu oei dêh char bơ̆n, yua kơ lu bơ̆n chă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu bơ̆n; lu bơ̆n chă boih Sư, na Sư ăn kơ bơ̆n đei hiôk-hian tăp dăr.” Lu sư tơiung pơdơ̆ng pơlei keh păng arih sa jơnap."
"And Asa had an army of three hundred thousand from Judah who carried shields and spears, and from Benjamin two hundred and eighty thousand men who carried shields and drew bows; all these were mighty men of valor.","Asa đei pêng-hrĕng rơbâu linh đơ̆ng bơngai Juđa đei khêl tih păng tơju; đei 'bar-rơbâu 'nu linh đơ̆ng bơngai Bênjamin chĕp khêl iĕ păng hră; đĭ-đăng lu sư tă kơ linh nuih kơtang ngăl."
"Then Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million men and three hundred chariots, and he came to Mareshah.","Sêra, bơngai Êthiôpi năm blah bơngai Juđa chông ba minh-rơbâu rơbâu linh păng pêng-hrĕng tŏ gre aseh, lu sư năm truh tơ pơlei Marêsa."
"So Asa went out against him, and they set the troops in battle array in the Valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.","Asa năm sơng tơ'bơ̆p sư, săp linh năm tơblah tơ lăm thŭng Sêphatha jê̆ pơlei Marêsa."
"And Asa cried out to the LORD his God, and said, “LORD, it is nothing for You to help, whether with many or with those who have no power; help us, O LORD our God, for we rest on You, and in Your name we go against this multitude. O LORD, You are our God; do not let man prevail against You!”","Asa krao apinh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei sư khan: “Ơ Kră Yang, ưh kơ đei bu thoi Ih tơgŭm lu bơngai tơrăn kĕ jei đơ̆ng bơngai pran; Ơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei nhôn, apinh Ih dŏng tơgŭm lu nhôn, lu nhôn gơnang kơ Ih; nhôn yua hăm anăn Ih na năm blah lu bơngai linh lơ âu.

"So the LORD struck the Ethiopians before Asa and Judah, and the Ethiopians fled.","Kră Yang blah pơrăm kon pơlei Êthiôpi 'bơ̆t anăp kon pơlei Juđa păng pơtao Asa; khŭl linh Êthiôpi kơdâu đĭ."
"And Asa and the people who were with him pursued them to Gerar. So the Ethiopians were overthrown, and they could not recover, for they were broken before the LORD and His army. And they carried away very much spoil.","Asa păng lu linh kiơ̆ sư, druh lu linh Êthiôpi truh tơ Gêrar; linh Êthiôpi lôch lơ tơpă, ưh pă đei bu arih, lu sư thuơ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang hăm lu linh Sư.

"Then they defeated all the cities around Gerar, for the fear of the LORD came upon them; and they plundered all the cities, for there was exceedingly much spoil in them.","Linh Juđa kư̆m đei blah lu pơlei tăp dăr kơ pơlei tih Gêrar, yua kơ đei tơdrong hli krưp dêh đơ̆ng Kră Yang pơm kơ lu pơlei tih noh; păng lu linh Asa blah iŏk đĭ mŭk tơmam đơ̆ng pơlei noh, yua kơ tơ lăm pơlei noh đei mŭk tơmam lơ dêh."
"They also attacked the livestock enclosures, and carried off sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.","Kŭm đei blah tơgar iŏk lu anih wei sem dơrong, rôp ba triu păng lăk-đa lơ tơpă, đơ̆ng noh lu sư wih brŏk tơ pơlei Jêrusalem."
"Now the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded.","Yang Bơhngol đơ̆ng Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei tơbăt ăn kơ Asaria, kon drŏ-nglo Ôđet"
"And he went out to meet Asa, and said to him: “Hear me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin. The LORD is with you while you are with Him. If you seek Him, He will be found by you; but if you forsake Him, He will forsake you.","Sư năm tơ'bơ̆p Asa păng khan: “Ơ Asa, păng đĭ bơngai Juđa hăm bơngai Bênjamin, mơ̆ng bĕ nơ̆r inh; lu iĕm oei hơdai hăm Kră Yang dang yơ, Kră Yang oei hơdai iĕm dang noh.

"For a long time Israel has been without the true God, without a teaching priest, and without law","Đunh boih lu bơngai Isơrael ưh kơ đei Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei sĭt tơpă. Ưh pă đei 'bok soi bơtho tơ'bôh, kư̆m ưh pă đei khôi juăt"
"but when in their trouble they turned to the LORD God of Israel, and sought Him, He was found by them.","Mă-lei mưh đei tơdrong gleh pơmat-tat truh lu sư wih tơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael păng krao chă Kră Yang na Sư ăn tơ'bơ̆p tơpă."
"And in those times there was no peace to the one who went out, nor to the one who came in, but great turmoil was on all the inhabitants of the lands.","Kơplah noh kon pơlei Isơrael ưh kơ đei rơnŭk ôh, chă nơnăm mơ̆t lĕch, yua kơ đĭ-đăng bơngai đei tơdrong rŭng răng tih tơpă."
"So nation was destroyed by nation, and city by city, for God troubled them with every adversity.","Dêh char 'nâu blah pơjuă dêh char nai, pơlei âu blah pơlei to yua kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ăn đei lơ tơdrong gleh pơmat wă pơrŭng lu sư."
"But you, be strong and do not let your hands be weak, for your work shall be rewarded!”","Mă-lei lu iĕm athei đei jơhngơ̆m nuih pran, ti lu iĕm 'nĕ pă rơdu achăng, yua kơ dôm tơdrong jang iĕm pơm gô đei yua.”"
"And when Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and removed the abominable idols from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities which he had taken in the mountains of Ephraim; and he restored the altar of the LORD that was before the vestibule of the LORD.","Wă Asa kơtơ̆ng boih nơ̆r 'nâu păng nơ̆r khan lê̆ adrol đơ̆ng Asaria kon drŏ-nglo Ôdet, jơhngơ̆m sư hiôk na sư nuih pơ̆n pơrăm lê̆ đĭ lu rup yang kơnê̆ đơ̆ng lăm jơ̆p kơ Juđa păng Bênjamin, hăm đơ̆ng lăm lu pơlei mă đêl lu sư 'nao blah iŏk tơ kơpal kông groi Êphraim; sư pơdơ̆ng hơmet chơnang soi Kră Yang 'bơ̆t anăp kơdeng hnam Kră Yang."
"Then he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those who dwelt with them from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon, for they came over to him in great numbers from Israel when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.","Sư akŭm đĭ bơngai Juđa, lu bơngai Bênjamin păng lu bơngai lăm Êphraim, Manase păng adrĕch Simêôn, mă oei oei hơdai lu sư; đei lơ bơngai Isơrael năm mơ̆t oei tơ gah sư, yua kơ 'bôh đei Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei tơgŭm păng oei hơdai Asa."
"So they gathered together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.","Lăm khei pêng sơnăm mơjĭt-pơđăm lăm chăl Asa, lu sư akŭm lăm pơlei Jêrusalem"
"And they offered to the LORD at that time seven hundred bulls and seven thousand sheep from the spoil they had brought.","Lăm năr noh lu sư iŏk tơpơh-hrĕng tŏ rơmo tơno păng tơpơh-rơbâu tŏ triu hăm bơbe, lu kon sem dơrong mă đơ̆ng lu sư blah iŏk, pơyơ̆r pơm tơmam soi bơnê kơ Kră Yang."
"Then they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul","Lu sư pơgơ̆p pơkă băl rim 'nu athei chă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei 'bok yă lu sư hăm đĭ jơhngơ̆m klơm klak."
"and whoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel was to be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.","Bu mă ưh kơ chă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael gô pơlôch, mă 'lơ̆p mă jŏ, drŏ-nglo dah drŏ-kăn."
"Then they took an oath before the LORD with a loud voice, with shouting and trumpets and rams’ horns.","Lu sư ôr jreo re pơkă pơkăm hăm Kră Yang, chơt hiôk tơkĕch, jreo, hlôm keng, hlôm tơgiĕp."
"And all Judah rejoiced at the oath, for they had sworn with all their heart and sought Him with all their soul; and He was found by them, and the LORD gave them rest all around.","Đĭ kơ bơngai Juđa chơt hiôk dêh kơ nơ̆r pơkă pơkăm noh, yua kơ lu sư đĭ jơhngơ̆m pơkă păng đĭ jơhngơ̆m krao chă Kră Yang na Sư ăn tơ'bơ̆p păng ăn kơ lu sư rơnŭk rơnua hiôk-hian rim pah."
"Also he removed Maachah, the mother of Asa the king, from being queen mother, because she had made an obscene image of Asherah; and Asa cut down her obscene image, then crushed and burned it by the Brook Kidron.","Pơtao Asa ưh pă ăn kơ yă sư Maaka jang dơ̆ng yua kơ sư pơm gơ̆ng kơkuh kơ rup yang Asêra. Pơtao Asa teh pơrăm lê̆ gơ̆ng rup yang noh teh pơchah hĕch hoch đĭ păng soh lê̆ tơ thŭng Kidrôn."
"But the high places were not removed from Israel. Nevertheless the heart of Asa was loyal all his days.","Mă lu anih tơ kơpal kơjung lu bơngai Isơrael sư ưh kơ đei pơrăm ôh; lei ră, jơhngơ̆m Asa oei arih 'lơ̆ng hăm Kră Yang lăm đĭ chăl arih sư."
"He also brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated and that he himself had dedicated: silver and gold and utensils.","Sư tah tơmam rơgoh lăm hnam Kră Yang tơmam noh đơ̆ng 'bă sư păng tơmam đơ̆ng sư kơdih mă đei klah 'măn lê̆ pha 'lơ̆ng rơgoh, maih, hu păng dôm pơnhan kơchŏk."
"And there was no war until the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa.","Ưh pă đei tơblah boih dĭng truh tơ sơnăm mă pêng-jĭt pơđăm lăm chăl sư pơgơ̆r."
"In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah and built Ramah, that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.","Lăm sơnăm mă pêng-jĭt tơdrâu chăl Asa pơgơ̆r, Baasa pơtao Isơrael, năm blah lu bơngai Juđa păng pơjing pơlei Rama kơjăp, wă găn ưh kơ ăn bu mơ̆t lĕch ôh tơ lăm teh đak Asa pơtao đe Juđa."
"Then Asa brought silver and gold from the treasuries of the house of the LORD and of the king’s house, and sent to Ben-Hadad king of Syria, who dwelt in Damascus, saying","Asa iŏk hu maih đơ̆ng lăm hnam mong tơmam hnam Kră Yang păng đơ̆ng lăm hnam mong tơmam pơtao, gơih ăn kơ Ben Hadat, pơtao Siri, oei lăm pơlei Đamas păng khan"
"“Let there be a treaty between you and me, as there was between my father and your father. See, I have sent you silver and gold; come, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, so that he will withdraw from me.”","“Bĕ ba pơgơ̆p hơdai ih hăm inh thoi bre 'bă ih hăm 'bă inh sơ̆. 'Nâu, inh gơih ăn kơ ih hu, maih. Apinh ih 'nĕ pă pơgơ̆p hăm Baasa pơtao Isơrael dơ̆ng, wă kơ sư weh đơ̆ng char inh.”"
"So Ben-Hadad heeded King Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel. They attacked Ijon, Dan, Abel Maim, and all the storage cities of Naphtali.","Ben Hadat mơ̆ng kiơ̆ pơtao Asa na wơh lu yŏng linh năm blah iŏk lu pơlei tih bơngai Isơrael; lu sư blah iŏk lu pơlei Ijôn, pơlei Đan, pơlei Abel Maim păng lu pơlei đei hnam mong tơmam char Naptali."
"Now it happened, when Baasha heard it, that he stopped building Ramah and ceased his work.","Wă Baasa kơtơ̆ng tơdrong noh, sư pơdơh ưh pă pơm pơjing pơlei Rama."
"Then King Asa took all Judah, and they carried away the stones and timber of Ramah, which Baasha had used for building; and with them he built Geba and Mizpah.","Pơtao Asa akŭm đĭ bơngai Juđa; lu sư năm iŏk đĭ lu tơmo, tơ̆r 'long mă đêl Baasa đei pơm pơjing pơlei Rama; na Asa iŏk dôm lu tơmam noh pơdơ̆ng pơjing pơlei Gêba păng pơlei Mispa."
"And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him: “Because you have relied on the king of Syria, and have not relied on the LORD your God, therefore the army of the king of Syria has escaped from your hand.","Kơplah noh Hanani bơngai khan lê̆ adrol năm tơ Asa pơtao đe Juđa na khan kơ sư: “Yua kơ ih gơnang dêh kơ pơtao Siri, ưh kơ gơnang kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ih ôh, na lu linh pơtao Siri kơdâu klaih boih đơ̆ng ti ih."
"Were the Ethiopians and the Lubim not a huge army with very many chariots and horsemen? Yet, because you relied on the LORD, He delivered them into your hand.","Lu linh Êthiôpi păng linh Libyan hăm trŏ nuih kơtang đei gre aseh păng lu linh hao aseh lơ dêh? Lei ră, pơtao gơnang kơ Kră Yang boih, na Sư jao lu linh noh lăm ti ih."
"For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show Himself strong on behalf of those whose heart is loyal to Him. In this you have done foolishly; therefore from now on you shall have wars.”","Măt Kră Yang lăng jơ̆p kơ teh đak, wă tơgŭm jơhngơ̆m pran kơ lu đe bu mă đei jơhngơ̆m gơnang kơ Sư.

"Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in prison, for he was enraged at him because of this. And Asa oppressed some of the people at that time.","Asa sư hil kơ bơngai khan lê̆ adrol noh dêh na rôp phak. Kơplah noh Asa kư̆m pơm kơnê̆ kơ lu kon pơlei hai."
"Note that the acts of Asa, first and last, are indeed written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.","Tơdrong jang Asa iŏk đơ̆ng blŭng-a truh tơ tôch đei chih răk lê̆ tơ lăm sơ̆p hla bơar lu pơtao đe Juđa păng bơngai Isơrael."
"And in the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa became diseased in his feet, and his malady was severe; yet in his disease he did not seek the LORD, but the physicians.","Lăm sơnăm mă pêng-jĭt tơsĭn chăl Asa pơgơ̆r, Asa sư đei jĭ jơ̆ng sư jĭ krưp dêh; kơplah sư jĭ jơ̆ng 'nâu sư ưh kơ chơchă Kră Yang, mă-lei sư chă 'bok pơgang wă ming mang."
"So Asa rested with his fathers; he died in the forty-first year of his reign.","Asa lôch năm kiơ̆ 'bok sư, sư lôch sơnăm mă puăn-jĭt mônh lăm chăl sư pơgơ̆r."
"They buried him in his own tomb, which he had made for himself in the City of David; and they laid him in the bed which was filled with spices and various ingredients prepared in a mixture of ointments. They made a very great burning for him.","Đe 'bŭ sư lăm bơsat mă anih sư đei sir boih kơ sư kơdih lăm pơlei Đawit, đe tơ'bĭch lăm bong mă đe đei tah 'bĕnh kơ pơgang 'bâu phu, đe đei hơmet boih kiơ̆ kơ juăt pơm soh, đe soh 'long pơgang 'bâu phu tih dêh lăm năr grong noh."
"Then Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place, and strengthened himself against Israel.","Jêhôsaphat kon drŏ-nglo Asa iung pơm pơtao pơgơ̆r pơtrơp kơ 'bă sư, sư pơgơ̆r dêh char sư kơjăp wă tơblah hăm bơngai Isơrael."
"And he placed troops in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim which Asa his father had taken.","Sư chă dan lê̆ lu linh tơ lăm rim pơlei mă đei pơm kơjăp lăm char Juđa, pơm kơđông kơjăp lăm char Juđa păng lăm pơlei char Êphraim mă pơtao Asa 'bă sư đei blah iŏk."
"Now the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the former ways of his father David; he did not seek the Baals","Kră Yang oei hơdai hăm Jêhôsaphat, yua kơ sư yak kiơ̆ trong 'bok Đawit, ưh kơ kiơ̆ yang Baal ôh"
"but sought the God of his father, and walked in His commandments and not according to the acts of Israel.","mă-lei chơchă Kră Yang 'bă sư pơm kiơ̆ wei răk nơ̆r Kră Yang tơtă, ưh kơ pơm kiơ̆ ôh thoi lu bơngai Isơrael pơm."
"Therefore the LORD established the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah gave presents to Jehoshaphat, and he had riches and honor in abundance.","Thoi ei na Kră Yang ăn kơ dêh char sư kơjăp lăm ti sư; đĭ-đăng bơngai Juđa ra pơyơ̆r ăn kơ Jêhôsaphat tơmam, sư mơdrŏng tih tơpă păng đe ư-ang."
"And his heart took delight in the ways of the LORD; moreover he removed the high places and wooden images from Judah.","Sư đei jơhngơ̆m hiôk kơjăp kiơ̆ trong Kră Yang; kư̆m oei đei pơrăm lê̆ lu anih kơjung păng lu rup yang Asêra lăm char Juđa."
"Also in the third year of his reign he sent his leaders, Ben-Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.","Sơnăm mă pêng lăm chăl Jêhôsaphat pơgơ̆r, sư wơh lu yŏng kơiĕng sư Bênhail, Ôbadia, Sachari, Nêthanel păng Mikaia lu sư năm chă bơtho tơ'bôh tơ jơ̆p pơlei lăm char Juđa"
"And with them he sent Levites: Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah—the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests.","Kŭm đei lu bơngai Lêwi kiơ̆ lu sư noh.

"So they taught in Judah, and had the Book of the Law of the LORD with them; they went throughout all the cities of Judah and taught the people.","Lu sư năm chĕp hla bơar khôi juăt Kră Yang năm tơ jơ̆p lu pơlei bơtho tơbăt ăn kơ kon pơlei pơla lăm char Juđa"
"And the fear of the LORD fell on all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah, so that they did not make war against Jehoshaphat.","Kră Yang ăn kơ đĭ-đăng dêh char tăp dăr kơ dêh char Juđa hli kơ Kră Yang, pơm kơ lu sư ưh kơ pơ̆n tơblah hăm Jêhôsaphat."
"Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents and silver as tribute; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand seven hundred rams and seven thousand seven hundred male goats.","Lu bơngai Philistin chĕp jên hu tơmam năm ba pơyơ̆r ăn kơ Jêhôsaphat, lu bơngai Arâp kư̆m lei-lăi năm ba pơyơ̆r ăn tơpơh-rơbâu tơpơh-hrĕng tŏ triu tơno păng tơpơh-rơbâu tơpơh-hrĕng tŏ bơbe tơno."
"So Jehoshaphat became increasingly powerful, and he built fortresses and storage cities in Judah.","Jêhôsaphat jing rai tih rai pran tŏk ling-lang, sư pơm anih kơđông linh kơjăp păng đei lu hnam mong tơmam tơ lu pơlei lăm char Juđa."
"He had much property in the cities of Judah; and the men of war, mighty men of valor, were in Jerusalem.","Sư đei mong mŭk tơmam lơ lăm char Juđa, sư đei lu linh nuih pran kơtang lăm pơlei tih Jêrusalem."
"These are their numbers, according to their fathers’ houses. Of Judah, the captains of thousands: Adnah the captain, and with him three hundred thousand mighty men of valor","'Nâu đe chih jô̆ kiơ̆ kơ hnam dơnŏ 'bă sư: Đơ̆ng adrĕch Juđa, lu yŏng pơgơ̆r rơbâu rơbâu 'nu linh: Noh đei Atnah yŏng pơgơ̆r kơ pêng-hrĕng rơbâu 'nu linh nuih pran kơtang hơdai hăm sư"

"After some years he went down to visit Ahab in Samaria; and Ahab killed sheep and oxen in abundance for him and the people who were with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramoth Gilead.","Dang 'bar pêng năr đơ̆ng rŏng sư jur năm ngôi tơ Ahap tơ pơlei Samari, Ahap đei 'bet sa lơ triu rơmo et sa hăm Jêhôsaphat hăm lu bơngai kiơ̆ sư, na pơthơr sư tŏk blah lu kon pơlei Ramôt Gileat."
"So Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, “Will you go with me against Ramoth Gilead?” And he answered him, “I am as you are, and my people as your people; we will be with you in the war.”","Ahap pơtao đe Isơrael khan kơ Jêhôsaphat pơtao đe Juđa: “Ih hăm wă năm hăm inh tŏk blah pơlei Ramôt Gileat ưh?” Sư drơ̆ng: “Inh kư̆m thoi ih; kon pơlei inh kư̆m thoi kon pơlei ih; nhôn gô năm hơdai ih tŏk blah.”"
"Also Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “Please inquire for the word of the LORD today.”","Jêhôsaphat kư̆m đei khan hăm pơtao Isơrael: “Mă-lei athei krao apinh Kră Yang adrol 'mơ̆i.”"
"Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said to them, “Shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?” So they said, “Go up, for God will deliver it into the king’s hand.”","Pơtao Isơrael krao akŭm lu 'bok khan lê̆ adrol, đei puăn-hrĕng 'nu, na jet lu sư: “Lu bơ̆n hăm gơh năm blah pơlei Ramôt tơ Gileat dah ưh?” Lu sư tơl: “Năm tŏk blah bĕ; Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei gô pơjao pơlei noh lăm ti ih, pơtao.”"

"So the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is still one man by whom we may inquire of the LORD; but I hate him, because he never prophesies good concerning me, but always evil.

"The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah, clothed in their robes, sat each on his throne; and they sat at a threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.","Kơplah noh pơtao Isơrael păng Jêhôsaphat pơtao Juđa, bre sư hrŭk hơbĕn ao pơtao sư, hơ-oei 'bơ̆t anih tang-dŏ pơtao sư, tơ anih đe pơjuă 'bơ̆t 'măng dur pơlei Samari; lu 'bok khan lê̆ adrol oei pơma khan lê̆ adrol đĭ 'bơ̆t anăp bre pơtao."

"Then the messenger who had gone to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, “Now listen, the words of the prophets with one accord encourage the king.

"And the LORD said, ‘Who will persuade Ahab king of Israel to go up, that he may fall at Ramoth Gilead?’ So one spoke in this manner, and another spoke in that manner.","Kră Yang jet: ‘Bu gô năm pơhlŭ Ahap, pơtao Isơrael, năm tŏk blah Ramôt tơ Gileat na gô lôch tơ noh?’ Đei mơ'nah pơma thoi âu mơ'nah khan thoi noh."

"Therefore look! The LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these prophets of yours, and the LORD has declared disaster against you.”","“Thoi noh Kră Yang ăn yang hơlĕnh pơma lăm 'bơ̆r lu bơngai khan lê̆ adrol pơtao păng Kră Yang kư̆m đei pơkă wă ăn tơdrong răm truh kơ pơtao.”"
"Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, “Which way did the spirit from the LORD go from me to speak to you?”","Sêdêkia, kon drŏ-nglo Kênaana, năm jê̆ tap tơ'bŏk Mikaia păng jet: “Trong ayơ Yang Bơhngol Kră Yang lĕch đơ̆ng inh năm roi kơ ih?”"

"But Micaiah said, “If you ever return in peace, the LORD has not spoken by me.” And he said, “Take heed, all you people!”","Mikaia khan: “Tơdah pơtao wih brŏk hiôk-hian, lei Kră Yang ưh kơ đei wă yua inh khan.” Sư khan dơ̆ng: “Ơ kon pơlei, đĭ-đăng iĕm mơ̆ng nơ̆r inh.”"
"So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.","Na pơtao Isơrael păng Jêhôsaphat pơtao Juđa tŏk năm tơ pơlei Ramôt Gileat."
"And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into battle; but you put on your robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into battle.","Pơtao Isơrael khan kơ Jêhôsaphat: “Inh gô hrŭk ao pha pơm thoi bơngai hmă na năm tŏk blah; gah ih athei hrŭk ao pơtao ih.” Pơtao Isơrael hrŭk hơbĕn ao hmă, dơ̆ng noh na bre sư năm tơblah."
"Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots who were with him, saying, “Fight with no one small or great, but only with the king of Israel.”","Pơtao Siri pơkă tơtă kơ lu yŏng linh hao gre aseh sư: “'Nĕ kơ blah bu hŏ mă 'lơ̆p, dah 'lŏ, mă-lei blah rĕng kơ minh 'nu pơtao Isơrael đĕch.”"
"So it was, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, “It is the king of Israel!” Therefore they surrounded him to attack; but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him, and God diverted them from him.","Wă lu yŏng linh hao gre aseh 'bôh Jêhôsaphat, na khan: “Noh boih pơtao Isơrael.” Na lu sư dăr wă blah sư.

"For so it was, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.","Wă lu yŏng linh hao gre aseh 'bôh boih noh ưh kơ trŏ kơ pơtao Isơrael, na lu sư kơdŭn tơ rŏng ưh pă druh blah dơ̆ng."
"Now a certain man drew a bow at random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of his armor. So he said to the driver of his chariot, “Turn around and take me out of the battle, for I am wounded.”","Mă-lei đei minh 'nu iŏk hră chă prah kư̆ kă tă kơ 'bơm pơtao Isơrael 'bơ̆t kơtơh sơlam ao bơsei; Ahap khan kơ linh chĕp ba gre aseh sư: “Wih bơkuĕch tơ rŏng năm chơ ba inh lĕch đơ̆ng anih tơblah âu, inh 'bơm 'brơ̆m boih."
"The battle increased that day, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot facing the Syrians until evening; and about the time of sunset he died.","Lăm năr noh tơdrong tơblah rai dêh; na pơtao Isơrael oei lăm gre aseh sư muh măt sư tơwih tơ khŭl linh Siri dĭng truh kơsơ̆ măng; sư lôch 'bơ̆t 'năr mơ̆t boih."
"Then Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned safely to his house in Jerusalem.","Jêhôsaphat, pơtao Juđa wih brŏk hiôk-hian tơ hnam pơtao sư tơ pơlei Jêrusalem."
"And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to King Jehoshaphat, “Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the LORD? Therefore the wrath of the LORD is upon you.","Jêhu kon drŏ-nglo Hanani, bơngai 'bôh adrol, lĕch năm sơng pơtao Jêhôsaphat păng khan: “Ih tơgŭm kơ lu bơngai pơm kơnê̆ păng 'mêm kơ lu bơngai areh kơ Kră Yang hă?

"Nevertheless good things are found in you, in that you have removed the wooden images from the land, and have prepared your heart to seek God.”","Mă-lei lăm ih kư̆m đei tơdrong 'lơ̆ng, ih đei pơrăm lê̆ boih lu gơ̆ng rup yang Asêra đơ̆ng lăm char ih păng ih kư̆m đei pơkă wă chă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei!”"
"So Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem; and he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the mountains of Ephraim, and brought them back to the LORD God of their fathers.","Jêhôsaphat oei tơ pơlei Jêrusalem, đơ̆ng noh sư năm chă dăr lăng lu kon pơlei đơ̆ng pơlei Bêrsêba truh tơ tơring kông groi Êphraim chông ba lu sư wih brŏk tơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei 'bok lu sư."
"Then he set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city","Sư pôk lu 'bok sek tơlang lăm rim pơlei kơjăp lăm dêh char Juđa."
"and said to the judges, “Take heed to what you are doing, for you do not judge for man but for the LORD, who is with you in the judgment.","Sư khan kơ lu 'bok sek tơlang: “Iĕm athei bơ̆jang mă pơ'lơ̆ng, yua kơ iĕm sek tơlang ưh kơ sĭ kơ sek kơ kon bơngai ôh, mă-lei kơ Kră Yang; Sư gô oei hơdai lu iĕm tơ rim wơ̆t wă sek tơlang."
"Now therefore, let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take care and do it, for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God, no partiality, nor taking of bribes.”","Thoi noh, na hli yom bĕ kơ Kră Yang athei sek tơlang mă 'lơ̆ng, yua kơ Kră Yang lu bơ̆n Sư tơpăt, ưh kơ mơ̆t minh pah, ưh kơ đei pơdê bu kư̆m ưh kơ đei iŏk jên đe răt.”"
"Moreover in Jerusalem, for the judgment of the LORD and for controversies, Jehoshaphat appointed some of the Levites and priests, and some of the chief fathers of Israel, when they returned to Jerusalem.","Lăm pơlei tih Jêrusalem Jêhôsaphat kư̆m chă rơih iŏk đơ̆ng lăm lu bơngai Lêwi, lu 'bok soi păng yŏng kơdră Isơrael wă kơ sek tơlang lu tơdrong pơjah pơjăng băl kiơ̆ tơdrong juăt Kră Yang.

"Whatever case comes to you from your brethren who dwell in their cities, whether of bloodshed or offenses against law or commandment, against statutes or ordinances, you shall warn them, lest they trespass against the LORD and wrath come upon you and your brethren. Do this, and you will not be guilty.","Tơdah đei lu 'nhŏng oh kon pơlei pơla đơ̆ng lăm pơlei nai năm tơkan tơ iĕm đei tơdrong truh, pơlôch bơngai dah pơm glăi kơ khôi juăt, nơ̆r tơtă, tơdrong juăt, nơ̆r tơbăt lu iĕm athei bơtho khan kơ lu sư 'nĕ kơ pơm yoch hăm Kră Yang, kơnh Kră Yang hil mĭl phak lu iĕm păng lu 'nhŏng oh iĕm: Pơm thoi ei na lu iĕm huay kơ đei yoch.”"
"And take notice: Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king’s matters; also the Levites will be officials before you. Behave courageously, and the LORD will be with the good.”","Pơtao pôk ăn Amaria 'bok soi tơm pơm yŏng sek tơlang kơ tơdrong pơm glăi hăm khôi juăt Kră Yang păng Sêbadia kon drŏ-nglo Ismael, pơm yŏng kơdră bơngai Juđa, Sư pơm yŏng sek tơlang tơdrong glăi hăm teh đak pơtao păng kư̆m iŏk lu bơngai Lêwi pơm 'bok sek tơlang tơgŭm.” Pơtao kư̆m đei pơkă dơ̆ng: “Lu iĕm athei mă nuih na bơ̆jang!

"And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem bowed before the LORD, worshiping the LORD.","Jêhôsaphat kŭp kơ̆l drap tơ teh; đĭ-đăng bơngai Juđa păng bơngai oei lăm pơlei Jêrusalem kư̆m kŭp kơ̆l drap tơ teh 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang păng kơkuh kơ Kră Yang."
"Then the Levites of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel with voices loud and high.","Lu bơngai Lêwi gah adrĕch Kôhat păng lu adrĕch Kôra lu sư iung dơ̆ng pơma 'bơ̆r re păng khan bơnê kơkuh kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael."
"So they rose early in the morning and went out into the Wilderness of Tekoa; and as they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Hear me, O Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem: Believe in the LORD your God, and you shall be established; believe His prophets, and you shall prosper.”","Truh pơgê đơ̆ng rŏng, lu sư iung đơ̆ng hrôih lĕch năm tơ tơmăn glă Têkôa; kơplah lu sư oei yak, Jêhôsaphat dơ̆ng tơ noh, khan: “Ơ lu bơngai Juđa păng kon pơlei oei lăm pơlei Jêrusalem mơ̆ng bĕ inh: Lui gơnang bĕ kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu iĕm, na lu iĕm pran kơjăp; lui bĕ kơ 'bok khan lê̆ adrol Kră Yang, lei na lu iĕm kĕ jei,”"
"And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed those who should sing to the LORD, and who should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army and were saying: “Praise the LORD, For His mercy endures forever.”","Đang kơ sư đei pơma pơđâu hăm kon pơlei pơla boih, na sư rơih iŏk đei khŭl hơri wă ư-ang kơ Kră Yang rang rŏ hơri bơnê ư-ang Kră Yang 'lơ̆ng rơgoh rang rŏ, lu sư yak adrol kơ khŭl linh, ôr khan: “Bơnê bĕ kơ Kră Yang. Tơdrong Sư 'mêm mơnat oei oei ling-lang.”"
"Now when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushes against the people of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah; and they were defeated.","Kơplah lu sư oei hơri kơkuh bơnê, Kră Yang hơmet minh khŭl răp blah bơngai Ammôn, bơngai Môap păng lu bơngai oei 'bơ̆t Kông Sêir oei năm blah bơngai Juđa ră na păng lu sư thuơ đĭ."
"For the people of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir to utterly kill and destroy them. And when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, they helped to destroy one another.","Kon pơlei Ammôn păng kon pơlei Môap năm blah kon pơlei oei 'bơ̆t Kông Sêir, wă pơlôch pơrăm đĭ lê̆ lu sư; dang kơ lu sư blah pơlôch kon pơlei oei 'bơ̆t Kông Sêir boih, na lu sư wih tơblah pơlôch băl tơduă."
"So when Judah came to a place overlooking the wilderness, they looked toward the multitude; and there were their dead bodies, fallen on the earth. No one had escaped.","Wă kon pơlei Juđa truh tơ anih kơjung, tơmang 'bôh lăm thŭng glă đei khŭl tơpôl linh lơlang lơlap, na kư̆m 'bôh lu akâu bơngai lôch sơ̆k glơch glach kơpal teh ưh kơ đei bu arih."
"When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away their spoil, they found among them an abundance of valuables on the dead bodies, and precious jewelry, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away; and they were three days gathering the spoil because there was so much.","Jêhôsaphat păng lu kon pơlei sư năm wă iŏk tơmam, 'bôh đei tơmam păng akâu bơngai lôch lơ tơpă păng đei tơmam gĭt lơ tơpă dônh iŏk mah pă kĕ đĭ; lu sư dônh mah pêng năr, yua kơ tơmam lơ tơpă."
"And on the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Berachah, for there they blessed the LORD; therefore the name of that place was called The Valley of Berachah until this day.","Truh năr mă puăn lu sư akŭm băl tơ lăm Thŭng Bêraka, tơ noh lu sư hơri kơkuh ư-ang kơ Kră Yang; yua kơ thoi noh na đe krao anih noh thŭng Bêraka truh tơ dang ei."
"Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, with Jehoshaphat in front of them, to go back to Jerusalem with joy, for the LORD had made them rejoice over their enemies.","Đơ̆ng noh pơtao Jêhôsaphat yak adrol kơ đĭ-đăng bơngai Juđa păng lu bơngai oei lăm pơlei Jêrusalem chơt hiôk wih tơ pơlei Jêrusalem; Kră Yang ăn kơ lu sư chơt hiôk, yua kơ Kră Yang blah pơrăm đĭ boih linh ayăt."
"So they came to Jerusalem, with stringed instruments and harps and trumpets, to the house of the LORD.","Lu sư brŏk truh mơ̆t lăm pơlei Jêrusalem, năm truh tơ hnam akŭm tơm Kră Yang reh brŏ dung, tĭng-nĭng păng hlôm keng."
"And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries when they heard that the LORD had fought against the enemies of Israel.","Wă lu kon pơlei pơla kơtơ̆ng kơ tơdrong Kră Yang blah pơrăm lu ayăt kơ bơngai Isơrael, na lu sư hli tơpă kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei."
"Then the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet, for his God gave him rest all around.","Thoi noh, dêh char pơtao Jêhôsaphat hiôk-hian rơnŭk rơnua, yua kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ăn kơ sư pơdơh hiôk-hian puăn pah."
"So Jehoshaphat was king over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.","Thoi noh Jêhôsaphat pơm pơtao pơgơ̆r dêh char Juđa iŏk đơ̆ng sư 'nao pêng-jĭt pơđăm sơnăm pơgơ̆r oei lăm pơlei tih Jêrusalem 'bar-jĭt pơđăm sơnăm mĕ sư anăn Asuba kon drŏ-kăn Silhi."
"And he walked in the way of his father Asa, and did not turn aside from it, doing what was right in the sight of the LORD.","Sư yak pơm kiơ̆ trong 'bă sư Asa, sư ưh kơ weh yak trong nai ôh; sư pơm 'lơ̆ng trŏ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang."
"Nevertheless the high places were not taken away, for as yet the people had not directed their hearts to the God of their fathers.","Mă-lei sư ưh tam mă pơrăm ôh anih kơjung păng kon pơlei ưh tam mă jao jơhngơ̆m kơ Kră Yang 'bok lu sư."
"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, indeed they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.","Dôm tơdrong jang nai Jêhôsaphat pơm đơ̆ng blŭng-a truh tơ tôch đei chih răk lăm sơ̆p hla bơar hơ'mon Jêhu, kon drŏ-nglo Hanani, tơdrong hơ'mon noh đei chih răk boih lăm sơ̆p hla bơar lu pơtao Isơrael."
"After this Jehoshaphat king of Judah allied himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, who acted very wickedly.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ noh Jêhôsaphat pơtao Juđa pơgơ̆p hăm Ahasia pơtao Isơrael, bơngai mă pơm kơnê̆."
"And he allied himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish, and they made the ships in Ezion Geber.","Bre sư pơgơ̆p băl pơm duk tơ Êsiôn Gêber wă năm tơ pơlei Tarsis."
"But Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, “Because you have allied yourself with Ahaziah, the LORD has destroyed your works.” Then the ships were wrecked, so that they were not able to go to Tarshish.","Kơplah noh Êliêser kon drŏ-nglo Dôdawahu đơ̆ng pơlei Marêsa khan lê̆ adrol gah Jêhôsaphat khan; “Yua kơ ih đei pơgơ̆p boih hăm Ahasia, Kră Yang gô pơrăm lê̆ tơdrong jang mă ih đei pơm boih.” Duk mă lu sư pơm noh pơchah, lei na duk noh ưh kơ gơh năm truh tơ Tarsis ôh."
"And Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David. Then Jehoram his son reigned in his place.","Jêhôsaphat lôch năm oei hơdai hăm lu 'bok sư, đe 'bŭ sư hơdai hăm lu 'bok sư lăm Pơlei Đawit; Jêhôram kon drŏ-nglo sư iung pơgơ̆r pơtrơp sư."
"He had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azaryahu, Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.","Sư đei lu oh sư, kon drŏ-nglo Jêhôsaphat noh Asaria, Jêhiêl, Secharia, Asariahu, Michael păng Sêphatia; đĭ-đăng lu đe noh kon drŏ-nglo Jêhôsaphat pơtao Isơrael."
"Their father gave them great gifts of silver and gold and precious things, with fortified cities in Judah; but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram, because he was the firstborn.","'Bă sư pơtao đei ăn boih kơ lu sư lơ mŭk tơmam, hu maih, lu mŭk tơmam gĭt păng jao ăn lu pơlei kơjăp lăm char Juđa; mă-lei jao ăn kơ Jêhôram pơm pơtao, yua kơ sư kon kơdră."
"Now when Jehoram was established over the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself and killed all his brothers with the sword, and also others of the princes of Israel.","Kơplah Jêhôram tŏk pơm pơtao pơtrơp đơ̆ng 'bă sư, wă sư pran kơjăp boih sư iŏk đao gưm pơlôch đĭ lu oh sư hăm lu yŏng pơgơ̆r Isơrael."
"Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.","Jêhôram 'nao pêng-jĭt 'bar sơnăm kơplah sư tŏk pơm pơtao păng sư pơgơ̆r đei tơhngam sơnăm lăm pơlei tih Jêrusalem."
"And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done, for he had the daughter of Ahab as a wife; and he did evil in the sight of the LORD.","Sư yak kiơ̆ trong lu pơtao Isơrael, kiơ̆ thoi Ahap đei pơm boih, yua kơ sư iŏk oei kơ kon adruh Ahap pơm akăn; sư pơm tơdrong kơnê̆ dêh 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang."
"Yet the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that He had made with David, and since He had promised to give a lamp to him and to his sons forever.","Lei ră Kră Yang ưh kơ wă pơlôch Sư adrĕch pơm pơtao, yua kơ Sư đei pơgơ̆p boih hăm Đawit, Sư đei pơkă boih wă ăn minh pôm ŭnh kơđeng kơ adrĕch Đawit kon sâu sư ling-lang, hlŏng hloi."
"In his days Edom revolted against Judah’s authority, and made a king over themselves.","Lăm chăl Jêhôram pơgơ̆r, char Eđôm iung blah lu bơngai Juđa păng pôk pơtao kơdih lu sư."
"So Jehoram went out with his officers, and all his chariots with him. And he rose by night and attacked the Edomites who had surrounded him and the captains of the chariots.","Jêhôram hăm lu yŏng pơgơ̆r linh păng lu gre aseh sư, năm blah Eđôm mă-lei linh Eđôm đĭ wang tăp kơ sư păng lu linh hao gre aseh sư mă-lei lu sư iung kơdâu lĕch hlôi kơmăng."
"Thus Edom has been in revolt against Judah’s authority to this day. At that time Libnah revolted against his rule, because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers.","Lei na bơngai Eđôm iung blah Juđa dĭng truh dang ei. Kŭm lăm kơplah noh kon pơlei Lipna kư̆m iung blah Jêhôram dơ̆ng, yua kơ sư achăng lê̆ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu 'bok sư."
"Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit harlotry, and led Judah astray.","Sư kư̆m pơm ming lu anih kơjung tơ kơpal groi char Juđa, pơhlŭ pơtơm kon pơlei mă oei lăm pơlei tih Jêrusalem pơm kơnê̆ oei sa kư̆ kă pơm kơ Juđa wơ̆l jrok."
"And a letter came to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus says the LORD God of your father David: Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father, or in the ways of Asa king of Judah","Êli bơngai khan lê̆ adrol chih hla bơar ăn kơ Jêhôram, khan: “Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Đawit, 'bok ih, khan: ‘Yua kơ ih ưh kơ yak kiơ̆ kơ trong Jêhôsaphat 'bă ih păng kư̆m ưh kơ kiơ̆ trong Asa, pơtao Juđa"
"but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and have made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot like the harlotry of the house of Ahab, and also have killed your brothers, those of your father’s household, who were better than yourself","Na đĭ kiơ̆ trong lu pơtao bơngai Isơrael, pơhlŭ pơtơm kon pơlei Juđa păng kon pơlei lăm Jêrusalem ngôi kư̆ kă kơkuh kơ rup Yang thoi adrĕch Ahap đei pơm boih păng kư̆m pơlôch boih lu oh ih đơ̆ng hnam 'bă ih, lu sư arih sa 'lơ̆ng hloh kơ ih"
"behold, the LORD will strike your people with a serious affliction—your children, your wives, and all your possessions","Lăng âu Kră Yang gô ăn tơdrong truh pơmat lu kon pơlei ih, lu kon sâu ih, truh tơ lu akăn ih, kư̆m pơrăm truh lu mŭk tơmam ih."
"and you will become very sick with a disease of your intestines, until your intestines come out by reason of the sickness, day by day.","Gah ih gô jĭ pơmat dêh rim năr rai dêh dĭng mah klơm klak ih ôm lĕch tơ 'nguaih.’ ”"
"Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines and the Arabians who were near the Ethiopians.","Kră Yang kư̆m pơm ăn jơhngơ̆m lu bơngai Philistin păng kon pơlei Arâp mă oei jê̆ kon pơlei Êthiôpi, iung blah Jêhôram."
"And they came up into Judah and invaded it, and carried away all the possessions that were found in the king’s house, and also his sons and his wives, so that there was not a son left to him except Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.","Lu sư wang blah iŏk char Juđa, blah iŏk đĭ hloi mŭk tơmam lăm hnam pơtao, rôp ba pơm bơnă đĭ lu kon drŏ-nglo lu akăn sư, oei lê̆ pă minh 'nu kon hơdruch sư Ahasia."
"After all this the LORD struck him in his intestines with an incurable disease.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ lu tơdrong noh, Kră Yang pơm kơ sư jĭ lăm klak ưh kơ layơ klaih."
"Then it happened in the course of time, after the end of two years, that his intestines came out because of his sickness; so he died in severe pain. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning for his fathers.","Lăm khei 'năr ei, 'bơ̆t wă jê̆ đĭ sơnăm mă 'bar klơm klak sư ôm lĕch tơ 'nguaih, sư lôch pơmat dêh; kon pơlei kư̆m ưh pă đei soh 'long 'bâu phu thoi 'bă sư."
"He was thirty-two years old when he became king. He reigned in Jerusalem eight years and, to no one’s sorrow, departed. However they buried him in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.","Sư pơm pơtao kơplah sư 'nao pêng-jĭt 'bar sơnăm sư pơgơ̆r đei tơhngam sơnăm lăm pơlei tih Jêrusalem; sư lôch ưh kơ đei bu 'mêm kơ sư, đe 'bŭ sư lăm Pơlei Đawit, mă-lei ưh kơ đei 'bŭ hơdai lăm bơsat lu pơtao ôh."
"Then the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his place, for the raiders who came with the Arabians into the camp had killed all the older sons. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, reigned.","Lu kon pơlei oei lăm Jêrusalem pôk Ahasia kon adruch Jêhôram, pơm pơtao đe Juđa pơtrơp 'bă sư yua kơ khŭl linh hơdai hăm linh Arâp mơ̆t blah lăm kơđông linh sư, na pơlôch đĭ lu kon drŏ-nglo 'nhŏng kơ sư, thoi noh Ahasia kon drŏ-nglo hơdruch Jêhôram iung pơm pơtao đe Juđa."
"Ahaziah was forty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athaliah the granddaughter of Omri.","Ahasia 'nao lăp 'bar-jĭt 'bar sơnăm năr sư iung pơm pơtao; sư pơgơ̆r minh sơnăm lăm pơlei tih Jêrusalem; mĕ sư anăn Athalia, Sâu drŏ-kăn Ômri."
"He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother advised him to do wickedly.","Sư kư̆m pơm kiơ̆ trong Ahap; yua kơ mĕ sư pơhlŭ sư pơm tơdrong kơnê̆."
"Therefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD, like the house of Ahab; for they were his counselors after the death of his father, to his destruction.","Sư pơm lơ tơdrong kơnê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, kư̆m thoi adrĕch Ahap đei pơm boih yua kơ đơ̆ng rŏng kơ 'bă sư lôch, Kon Sâu Ahap chă đon hơlĕnh pơhlŭ sư, wă pơm kơ sư răm."
"He also followed their advice, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.","Sư kư̆m hlŭ kiơ̆ kơ đe noh na yak kiơ̆ Jôram kon drŏ-nglo Ahap, pơtao Isơrael, năm blah tơ pơlei Ramôt Gileat, wă tơblah hăm Hasael pơtao Siri; kon pơlei Siri blah Jôram rơka."
"Then he returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds which he had received at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.","Na sư wih brŏk tơ pơlei Jesreel, wă ming rơka sư đơ̆ng tơblah 'bơ̆t pơlei Rama, tơblah hăm Hasael, pơtao Siri, Ahasia kon drŏ-nglo Jêhôram pơtao Juđa jur tơ Jêsreel wă năm lăng Jôram kon drŏ-nglo Ahap."
"His going to Joram was God’s occasion for Ahaziah’s downfall; for when he arrived, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.","Tơdrong Ahasia năm lăng Jôram jĭ rơka noh đơ̆ng Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ăn wă phak sư; wă sư năm truh tơ noh, kiơ̆ Jôram năm tơ'bơ̆p Jêhu kon drŏ-nglo Nimsi, bơngai mă Kră Yang rơih, wă kơ sư năm blah pơrăm adrĕch Ahap."
"And it happened, when Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah’s brothers who served Ahaziah, that he killed them.","Kơplah Jêhu năm blah adrĕch Ahap, tơ'bơ̆p lu yŏng bơngai Juđa, păng lu kon drŏ-nglo lu 'nhŏng oh Ahasia, lu bơngai mă tơgŭm Ahasia, na sư pơlôch đĭ lu sư hloi."
"Then he searched for Ahaziah; and they caught him (he was hiding in Samaria), and brought him to Jehu. When they had killed him, they buried him, “because,” they said, “he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart.” So the house of Ahaziah had no one to assume power over the kingdom.","Sư kư̆m chă Ahasia oei kơdâu ôn lăm pơlei Samari; đe rôp, chông ba sư tơ Jêhu, đơ̆ng noh pơlôch sư.

"Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal heirs of the house of Judah.","Wă Athalia, mĕ Ahasia 'bôh kon drŏ-nglo sư đe pơlôch, na sư iung blah pơrăm adrĕch pơm pơtao Juđa."
"But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king’s sons who were being murdered, and put him and his nurse in a bedroom. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from Athaliah so that she did not kill him.","Mă-lei Jêhôseba, kon adruh pơtao Jêhôram, rôp ôn lê̆ Jôas, kon drŏ-nglo Ahasia đơ̆ng tŏk-bŏk lu kon drŏ-nglo pơtao mă đe wă pơlôch đĭ na ôn lê̆ sư lăm anih tep hơdai hăm drŏ-kăn rong sư.

"And he was hidden with them in the house of God for six years, while Athaliah reigned over the land.","Jôas đe ôn lê̆ sư lăm tơdrâu sơnăm tơ lăm hnam akŭm Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei kơplah yă Athalia pơgơ̆r char noh."
"In the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and made a covenant with the captains of hundreds: Azariah the son of Jeroham, Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, Azariah the son of Obed, Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri.","Lăm sơnăm mă tơpơh, Jêhôiada iung đei jơhngơ̆m nuih pran, pơgơ̆p hơdai hăm lu yŏng pơgơ̆r minh-hrĕng 'nu linh, noh Asaria kon drŏ-nglo Jêrôham, Ismael kon drŏ-nglo Jêhôhanan, Asaria kon drŏ-nglo Ôbet, Maaseia kon drŏ-nglo Ađaia păng Êlisaphat kon drŏ-nglo Sikri."
"And they went throughout Judah and gathered the Levites from all the cities of Judah, and the chief fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.","Lu sư chă năm jơ̆p kơ dêh char Juđa lu sư akŭm lu bơngai Lêwi păng lu yŏng kơdră adrĕch bơngai Isơrael đơ̆ng jơ̆p pơlei lăm char Jut; na lu sư năm tơ pơlei Jêrusalem."
"Then all the assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said to them, “Behold, the king’s son shall reign, as the LORD has said of the sons of David.","Đĭ khŭl akŭm lu sư pơm tơdrong pơgơ̆p hăm pơtao lăm hnam Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei.

"This is what you shall do: One-third of you entering on the Sabbath, of the priests and the Levites, shall be keeping watch over the doors","'Nâu tơdrong lu iĕm athei pơm: Minh lăm pêng 'nu lu iĕm, lu 'bok soi păng lu bơngai Lêwi, bơ̆jang lăm năr Sa'bat, athei lu wei 'măng jang"
"one-third shall be at the king’s house; and one-third at the Gate of the Foundation. All the people shall be in the courts of the house of the LORD.","minh lăm pêng lu iĕm gô gak lăm hnam pơtao păng minh lăm pêng dơ̆ng gô dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t 'Măng Jang Hơnă; păng đĭ-đăng lu kon pơlei gô dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t cham hnam Kră Yang."
"But let no one come into the house of the LORD except the priests and those of the Levites who serve. They may go in, for they are holy; but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD.","'Nĕ ăn kơ minh 'nu bu mơ̆t lăm hnam Kră Yang ôh 'nguaih kơ lu 'bok soi păng lu bơngai Lêwi mă awih awăn; lu sư gô mơ̆t, yua kơ lu sư 'lơ̆ng rơgoh; đĭ-đăng kon pơlei athei wei răk nơ̆r Kră Yang tơtă."
"And the Levites shall surround the king on all sides, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whoever comes into the house, let him be put to death. You are to be with the king when he comes in and when he goes out.”","Lu bơngai Lêwi dơ̆ng tăp dăr kơ pơtao, rim 'nu chĕp khêl đao; bơngai bu mơ̆t lăm hnam Kră Yang gô pơlôch; lu iĕm athei bơwei pơtao mă sư mơ̆t dah sư lĕch.”"
"So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. And each man took his men who were to be on duty on the Sabbath, with those who were going off duty on the Sabbath; for Jehoiada the priest had not dismissed the divisions.","Lu bơngai Lêwi păng đĭ-đăng lu kon pơlei bơngai Juđa pơm kiơ̆ nơ̆r Jêhôiada 'bok soi đei athei tơtă; rim 'nu lu sư athei pơkeh rim tơdrong jang năr Sa'bat hơdai hăm lu bơngai mă oei wă mơ̆t jang lăm năr Sa'bat, yua kơ Jêhôiada 'bok soi ưh kơ ăn kơ minh 'nu bu pơdơh."
"And Jehoiada the priest gave to the captains of hundreds the spears and the large and small shields which had belonged to King David, that were in the temple of God.","Jêhôiada 'bok soi đei asong ăn kơ lu yŏng pơgơ̆r minh-hrĕng 'nu linh chĕp tơju, khêl tih iĕ đơ̆ng Đawit tah lê̆ lăm hnam Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei."
"Then he set all the people, every man with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and by the temple, all around the king.","Sư ăn kơ lu linh noh chĕp khêl đao dơ̆ng tăp dăr kơ pơtao, iŏk đơ̆ng gah yă-nơ̆m kơ hnam akŭm truh tơ gah gơal kơ hnam akŭm jê̆ chơnang soi."
"And they brought out the king’s son, put the crown on him, gave him the Testimony, and made him king. Then Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, “Long live the king!”","Jêhôiada hăm lu kon drŏ-nglo Sư chông kon pơtao lĕch, pơyơ̆l ăn kơ sư môk pơtao păng ăn kơ sư sơ̆p hla bơar khôi juăt, na pôk sư pơm pơtao; sư tuh đak rơmă tơ kơ̆l Jôas păng khan: “Pơtao arih ling-lang!”"
"Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people in the temple of the LORD.","Wă Athalia kơtơ̆ng jơwa kon pơlei kơdâu, ôr kơkuh ư-ang kơ pơtao, sư năm tơ kon pơlei tơ hnam Kră Yang."
"When she looked, there was the king standing by his pillar at the entrance; and the leaders and the trumpeters were by the king. All the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets, also the singers with musical instruments, and those who led in praise. So Athaliah tore her clothes and said, “Treason! Treason!”","Sư 'bôh pơtao dơ̆ng jê̆ jrăng 'bơ̆t trong wă mơ̆t; lu yŏng linh păng lu bơngai hlôm keng dơ̆ng jê̆ pơtao; đĭ-đăng kon pơlei oei lăm char chơt hiôk 'nă hal hlôm keng, kư̆m đei lu bơngai hơri pơtơm pôk pơư reh brŏ, na kơkuh bơnê ư-ang kơ pơtao.

"And Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds who were set over the army, and said to them, “Take her outside under guard, and slay with the sword whoever follows her.” For the priest had said, “Do not kill her in the house of the LORD.”","'Bok soi Jêhôiada athei lu yŏng pơgơ̆r minh-hrĕng linh păng khan kơ lu sư: “Chông tơlĕch yă âu tơ 'nguaih bĕ, bơngai bu kiơ̆ sư gô pơlôch hăm đao gưm.” 'Bok soi đei khan boih: “'Nĕ kơ pơlôch sư tơ lăm hnam Kră Yang ôh.”"
"So they seized her; and she went by way of the entrance of the Horse Gate into the king’s house, and they killed her there.","Na đe rôp yă ei 'bơ̆t 'Măng Jang Aseh, na đe pơlôch hloi sư tơ noh."
"Then Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, the people, and the king, that they should be the LORD’s people.","Jêhôiada pơgơ̆p hăm lu kon pơlei păng pơtao, wă kơ lu sư jing kon pơlei pơla Kră Yang."
"And all the people went to the temple of Baal, and tore it down. They broke in pieces its altars and images, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.","Đĭ-đăng lu kon pơlei năm tơ hnam yang Baal, pơrăm lê̆ lu chơnang soi păng rup man sư păng pơlôch Matan 'bok soi kơ yang Baal 'bơ̆t anăp chơnang soi."
"Also Jehoiada appointed the oversight of the house of the LORD to the hand of the priests, the Levites, whom David had assigned in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the Law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was established by David.","Jêhôiada jao kơ lu 'bok soi bơngai Lêwi wei-lăng hnam akŭm Kră Yang, wă pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'buh kơ Kră Yang, rok thoi lăm sơ̆p hla bơar Khôi Juăt Môis đei chih boih, hơdai hăm hơri ư-ang chơt hiôk kiơ̆ kơ Đawit đei pơkă boih."
"And he set the gatekeepers at the gates of the house of the LORD, so that no one who was in any way unclean should enter.","Sư kư̆m pơjao ăn kơ lu bơngai gak wei-lăng lu 'măng jang hnam Kră Yang, wă ưh kơ đei bơngai bu 'mê̆-'mach kơnê̆ mơ̆t tơ noh."
"Then he took the captains of hundreds, the nobles, the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought the king down from the house of the LORD; and they went through the Upper Gate to the king’s house, and set the king on the throne of the kingdom.","Sư pơtơm lu yŏng pơgơ̆r minh-hrĕng linh, lu kră mă đe pơyom păng lu yŏng pơgơ̆r kon pơlei, hăm kon pơlei lăm tơring char, năm ba pơtao lĕch đơ̆ng lăm hnam Kră Yang jur năm tơ hnam pơtao mơ̆t rok trong 'Măng Jang Kơpal, wă ăn kơ sư hơ-oei 'bơ̆t tang-dŏ pơtao pơgơ̆r dêh char."
"So all the people of the land rejoiced; and the city was quiet, for they had slain Athaliah with the sword.","Thoi noh đĭ-đăng kon pơlei oei lăm char ei chơt hiôk chhôk 'nă hal păng lăm pơlei tih Jêrusalem hiôk-hian, đang kơ pơlôch lê̆ Athalia hăm đao gưm."
"Joash was seven years old when he became king, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zibiah of Beersheba.","Jôas 'nao tơpơh sơnăm năr sư pơm pơtao; sư pơgơ̆r puăn-jĭt sơnăm lăm pơlei tih Jêrusalem; mĕ sư anăn Sibia đơ̆ng pơlei Bêrsêba"
"Joash did what was right in the sight of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest.","Jôas pơm tơdrong 'lơ̆ng tơpăt 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang lăm đĭ sơnăm Jêhôiada pơm 'bok soi."
"And Jehoiada took two wives for him, and he had sons and daughters.","Jêhôiada chă ăn kơ Jôas 'bar 'nu akăn, sư đei kon hơ'lơ̆p drŏ-nglo drŏ-kăn."
"Now it happened after this that Joash set his heart on repairing the house of the LORD.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ noh, Jôas wă pơdơ̆ng ming Hnam Kră Yang."
"Then he gathered the priests and the Levites, and said to them, “Go out to the cities of Judah, and gather from all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that you do it quickly.” However the Levites did not do it quickly.","Sư krao akŭm lu 'bok soi păng lu bơngai Lêwi, na khan: “Năm tơ jơ̆p-jang kơ pơlei Juđa bĕ, ra pơpôi jên kăk đơ̆ng lu bơngai Isơrael 'măn rim sơnăm wă hơmet ming Hnam Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu iĕm; pơm bĕ tơdrong 'nâu mă kuăng.” Mă-lei lu bơngai Lêwi pơhiơ̆ dêh."
"So the king called Jehoiada the chief priest, and said to him, “Why have you not required the Levites to bring in from Judah and from Jerusalem the collection, according to the commandment of Moses the servant of the LORD and of the assembly of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?”","Pơtao krao Jêhôiada 'bok soi tơm păng khan: “Yua kơ kiơ ih ưh kơ pơkă kơ lu bơngai Lêwi chĕp ba jên lu bơngai Juđa păng lu bơngai oei lăm pơlei Jêrusalem ra ăn kiơ̆ kơ Môis đĭch đam Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei mă đei pơkă boih hăm lu kon pơlei Isơrael athei pơyơ̆r ăn kơ Bơsŭn Roi Tơbăt?”"
"For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken into the house of God, and had also presented all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD to the Baals.","Đơ̆ng lu kon drŏ-nglo Athalia yă pơm kơnê̆ dêh noh, teh 'măng mơ̆t tơtông lăm hnam Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu sư kư̆m iŏk đĭ tơmam rơgoh đơ̆ng Hnam Kră Yang pơyơ̆r ăn kơ yang Baal."
"Then at the king’s command they made a chest, and set it outside at the gate of the house of the LORD.","Thoi noh pơtao athei đe pơ̆ng minh pôm hom, lê̆ 'bơ̆t 'măng jang Hnam Kră Yang."
"And they made a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to bring to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God had imposed on Israel in the wilderness.","Đơ̆ng noh năm roi tơbăt tơ jơ̆p lăm char Juđa păng pơlei Jêrusalem rim 'nu athei năm pơyơ̆r jên ăn kơ Kră Yang kiơ̆ thoi Môis đĭch đam Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei đei pơkă ăn boih kơ lu bơngai Isơrael tơ lăm tơmăn glă."
"Then all the leaders and all the people rejoiced, brought their contributions, and put them into the chest until all had given.","Đĭ-đăng lu yŏng pơgơ̆r păng lu kon pơlei chơt hiôk năm pơyơ̆r ba jên tah lăm hom noh mah 'bĕnh."
"So it was, at that time, when the chest was brought to the king’s official by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, that the king’s scribe and the high priest’s officer came and emptied the chest, and took it and returned it to its place. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.","Rim wơ̆t lu bơngai Lêwi tung tơmơ̆t hom, na năm ba ăn kơ lu bơngai yŏng bơ̆jang kơ pơtao, lu Sư 'bôh jên 'bĕnh, bơngai chih hla bơar lăm hnam pơtao păng lu bơngai bơ̆jang kơ 'bok soi tơm năm tuh jên đơ̆ng lăm hom noh, đơ̆ng noh năm dan 'măn lê̆ 'bơ̆t anih đêl dơ̆ng. Rim năr lu sư pơm thoi noh, na đei ra pơpôi jên lơ tơpă."
"The king and Jehoiada gave it to those who did the work of the service of the house of the LORD; and they hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also those who worked in iron and bronze to restore the house of the LORD.","Pơtao păng Jêhôiada jao jên noh ăn kơ lu bơngai wei-lăng bơ̆jang lăm Hnam Kră Yang; lu sư apah lu bơngai jang man păng lu bơngai ot 'long, wă pơdơ̆ng ming Hnam Kră Yang; păng wă apah lu bơngai hơjơ̆m bơsei păng kong wă hơmet ming Hnam Kră Yang."
"So the workmen labored, and the work was completed by them; they restored the house of God to its original condition and reinforced it.","Lu bơngai wei-lăng bơ̆jang, pơtơm bơ̆jang, Tơdrong jang rai 'lơ̆ng đơ̆ng lu sư pơm hơmet. Lu Sư hơmet ming hnam Kră Yang kiơ̆ thoi so păng pơm ming kơjăp hloh."
"When they had finished, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada; they made from it articles for the house of the LORD, articles for serving and offering, spoons and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of Jehoiada.","Đang kơ lu sư pơm keh boih lu sư năm ba lu jên mă rơkah noh kơ pơtao păng Jêhôiada; lu sư yua lu jên noh pơm tơmam wă yua lăm Hnam Kră Yang, thoi wă pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'buh, lu pơnhan chhĕr păng lu tơmam đe pơm păng hu maih.

"But Jehoiada grew old and was full of days, and he died; he was one hundred and thirty years old when he died.","Jêhôiada đĭ kră sơnăm đĭ lơ, sư arih đei minh-hrĕng pêng-jĭt sơnăm na Sư lôch."
"And they buried him in the City of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God and His house.","Đe 'bŭ sư hơdai hăm lu pơtao lăm Pơlei Đawit, yua kơ sư jang 'lơ̆ng tơgŭm lu bơngai Isơrael, bơ̆jang kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei păng đei pơdơ̆ng hơmet ming hnam akŭm Tơm Sư."
"Now after the death of Jehoiada the leaders of Judah came and bowed down to the king. And the king listened to them.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ Jêhôiada lôch boih, lu yŏng pơgơ̆r bơngai Juđa năm kơkuh pơtơm pơtao. Na pơtao lui kiơ̆ nơ̆r lu sư pơhlŭ."
"Therefore they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served wooden images and idols; and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem because of their trespass.","Lu sư achăng lê̆ Hnam Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei 'bok lu sư, na kơkuh kơ yang Asêra păng kơkuh kơ lu rup man; đơ̆ng tơdrong yoch 'nâu, na đei Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei hil mĭl kơ lu bơngai Juđa păng kon pơlei Jêrusalem."
"Yet He sent prophets to them, to bring them back to the LORD; and they testified against them, but they would not listen.","Kră Yang wơh lu 'bok khan lê̆ adrol năm tơ lu sư, wă dui lu sư wih brŏk tơ Kră Yang; mă-lei lu sư ưh kơ wă mơ̆ng."
"Then the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, who stood above the people, and said to them, “Thus says God: ‘Why do you transgress the commandments of the LORD, so that you cannot prosper? Because you have forsaken the LORD, He also has forsaken you.’ ”","Yang Bơhngol 'lơ̆ng đơ̆ng Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei pơdrŭt Sachari, kon drŏ-nglo Jêhôiada 'bok soi, sư iung dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp lu kon pơlei na khan: “Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei khan thoi âu: ‘Yua kơ kiơ lu iĕm ưh kơ kiơ̆ nơ̆r Kră Yang tơtă?

"So they conspired against him, and at the command of the king they stoned him with stones in the court of the house of the LORD.","Lu sư hil plơ̆ kơ Sachari, kiơ̆ đơ̆ng pơtao athei klơ̆m pơlôch hăm tơmo 'bơ̆t cham Hnam Kră Yang."
"Thus Joash the king did not remember the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but killed his son; and as he died, he said, “The LORD look on it, and repay!”","Thoi noh, pơtao Jôas đĭ hiơt boih kơ Jêhôiada 'bă Sachari đei pơm 'lơ̆ng kơ sư, mă-lei sư pơlôch lê̆ kon Jêhôiada. 'Bơ̆t Sachari wă jê̆ lôch sư khan. “Hơpơi apinh Kră Yang lăng păng iung kơting.”"
"So it happened in the spring of the year that the army of Syria came up against him; and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the leaders of the people from among the people, and sent all their spoil to the king of Damascus.","Lăp sơnăm noh wă jê̆ tôch, đei lu linh char Siri iung blah Jôas; lu bơngai năm blah truh tơ char Juđa păng pơlei Jêrusalem, pơlôch đĭ lu yŏng pơgơ̆r lăm kon pơlei păng chơ ba dôm tơmam mă đêl lu sư blah iŏk ăn kơ pơtao lu sư tơ Đamas."
"For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men; but the LORD delivered a very great army into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash.","Khŭl linh Siri năm blah lăp tŏ sĕt đĕch ră, mă-lei Kră Yang jao boih lu linh lơ noh lăm ti lu sư, yua kơ lu bơngai Juđa achăng lê̆ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei 'bok lu sư. Na lu sư rôp sek tơlang Jôas."
"And when they had withdrawn from him (for they left him severely wounded), his own servants conspired against him because of the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and killed him on his bed. So he died. And they buried him in the City of David, but they did not bury him in the tombs of the kings.","Wă lu linh Siri weh tơ nai boih, lê̆ Jôas đei rơka jrŭ dêh.

"These are the ones who conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess.","Lu đe mă iung blah sư noh: Sabat kon drŏ-nglo yă Simêa bơngai Ammôn, Jêhôsabat, kon drŏ-nglo yă Simrit bơngai Môap."
"Now concerning his sons, and the many oracles about him, and the repairing of the house of God, indeed they are written in the annals of the book of the kings. Then Amaziah his son reigned in his place.","Roi tơdrong lu kon drŏ-nglo sư, đei nơ̆r khan lê̆ adrol gah sư păng roi kơ tơdrong wă kơ pơm hơmet ming hnam Kră Yang, đei chih răk lăm sơ̆p hla bơar hơ'mon lu pơtao. Amasia kon drŏ-nglo sư pơgơ̆r pơtrơp đơ̆ng sư."
"Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.","Amasia pơm pơtao sư 'nao lăp 'bar-jĭt pơđăm sơnăm, sư pơgơ̆r 'bar-jĭt tơsĭn sơnăm lăm pơlei Jêrusalem; mĕ sư anăn Jêhôadin, pơlei Jêrusalem."
"And he did what was right in the sight of the LORD, but not with a loyal heart.","Sư bơngai pơm 'lơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, mă-lei ưh kơ đĭ jơhngơ̆m."
"Now it happened, as soon as the kingdom was established for him, that he executed his servants who had murdered his father the king.","Wă sư pơgơ̆r dêh char sư kơjăp, sư pơlôch đĭ lu bơngai yŏng mă đêl pơlôch 'bă sư."
"However he did not execute their children, but did as it is written in the Law in the Book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, “The fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor shall the children be put to death for their fathers; but a person shall die for his own sin.”","Mă-lei sư ưh kơ pơlôch ôh kon drŏ-nglo đe noh, kiơ̆ thoi đei chih lăm sơ̆p hla bơar khôi juăt Môis.

"Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together and set over them captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, according to their fathers’ houses, throughout all Judah and Benjamin; and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them to be three hundred thousand choice men, able to go to war, who could handle spear and shield.","Amasia krao akŭm đĭ lu bơngai Juđa kiơ̆ kơ adrĕch adrung 'bok sư lăm Juđa păng Bênjamin, na pơjao ăn pơm yŏng pơgơ̆r kơ minh-rơbâu 'nu, minh-hrĕng 'nu; jô̆ iŏk đơ̆ng 'bar-jĭt sơnăm tơ kơpơ̆ng, đei pêng-hrĕng rơbâu 'nu lu bơngai mă gơh năm tơblah, chĕp khêl hơlă."
"He also hired one hundred thousand mighty men of valor from Israel for one hundred talents of silver.","Sư kư̆m mưng minh-hrĕng rơbâu 'nu linh nuih kơtang dơ̆ng đơ̆ng lăm lu bơngai Isơrael, apah minh-hrĕng talâng jên hu."
"But a man of God came to him, saying, “O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for the LORD is not with Israel—not with any of the children of Ephraim.","Mă-lei bơngai Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei yua năm khan kơ sư: “Ơ pơtao 'nĕ ăn kơ lu linh bơngai Isơrael năm hơdai ih, yua kơ Kră Yang ưh kơ oei hơdai hăm lu bơngai Isơrael ôh, kư̆m ưh kơ oei hơdai hăm lu kon sâu Êphraim mơ̆n."
"But if you go, be gone! Be strong in battle! Even so, God shall make you fall before the enemy; for God has power to help and to overthrow.”","Dah ih kiơ̆ trong 'nâu mă tơblah pran kơtang Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei gô ăn kơ ih thuơ 'bơ̆t anăp lu ayăt kơ ih yua kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei gơh tơgŭm kĕ jei, kư̆m gơh ăn thuơ.”"
"Then Amaziah said to the man of God, “But what shall we do about the hundred talents which I have given to the troops of Israel?” And the man of God answered, “The LORD is able to give you much more than this.”","Amasia jet bơngai Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei: “Bĕ gah minh-hrĕng talâng jên inh apah linh Isơrael noh thoi yơ?” Bơngai Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei tơl: “Kră Yang gơh ăn kơ ih đei lơ hloh kơ noh dơ̆ng.”"
"So Amaziah discharged the troops that had come to him from Ephraim, to go back home. Therefore their anger was greatly aroused against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.","Thoi noh Amasia tơbrŏk lê̆ lu linh đơ̆ng khŭl Êphraim mă năm truh tơ sư boih, lu sư hil dêh kơ bơngai Juđa, na wih brŏk tơ hnam jơhngơ̆m blĕk kơŭl."
"Then Amaziah strengthened himself, and leading his people, he went to the Valley of Salt and killed ten thousand of the people of Seir.","Amasia iŏk tơiung pơm jơhngơ̆m nuih, chông ba lu kon pơlei năm truh tơ Thŭng 'Boh, tơblah păng pơlôch mơjĭt-rơbâu 'nu bơngai Sêir."
"Also the children of Judah took captive ten thousand alive, brought them to the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, so that they all were dashed in pieces.","Linh Juđa kư̆m đei rôp arih mơjĭt-rơbâu 'nu ba lu sư tŏk tơ kơpal kông tơmo, na tơlơ̆ lu sư đơ̆ng kơpal kông noh tơ ala, lu sư lôch akâu pơchah hĕch đĭ."
"But as for the soldiers of the army which Amaziah had discharged, so that they would not go with him to battle, they raided the cities of Judah from Samaria to Beth Horon, killed three thousand in them, and took much spoil.","Gah lu linh mă Amasia tơbrŏk, ưh kơ ăn năm tơblah hơdai sư noh, mơ̆t blah lăm lu pơlei Juđa đơ̆ng pơlei Samari truh tơ pơlei Bêt Hôrôn, na pơlôch pêng-rơbâu 'nu kon pơlei tơ noh păng blah tơgar iŏk lơ mŭk tơmam."
"Now it was so, after Amaziah came from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the people of Seir, set them up to be his gods, and bowed down before them and burned incense to them.","Kơplah Amasia brŏk đơ̆ng tơblah bơngai Eđôm, sư chĕp ba rup yang lu bơngai Sêir pơm yang sư kơdih, kơkuh păng pơyơ̆r tơmam soi kơ rup yang noh."
"Therefore the anger of the LORD was aroused against Amaziah, and He sent him a prophet who said to him, “Why have you sought the gods of the people, which could not rescue their own people from your hand?”","Kră Yang hil kơ Amasia na wơh minh 'nu bơngai khan lê̆ adrol năm khan kơ sư: “Yua kơ kiơ ih kơkuh gơnang kơ rup yang mă ưh kơ gơh dŏng pơklaih đơ̆ng ti kon pơlei mă kơkuh gơnang kơ sư?”"
"So it was, as he talked with him, that the king said to him, “Have we made you the king’s counselor? Cease! Why should you be killed?” Then the prophet ceased, and said, “I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not heeded my advice.”","Mă-lei kơplah 'bok khan lê̆ adrol oei pơma, pơtao khan plơ̆: “Nhôn hăm đei pôk ih chă đon kơ inh?

"Now Amaziah king of Judah asked advice and sent to Joash the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come, let us face one another in battle.”","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ Amasia pơtao đe Juđa chă đon, na athei đe năm truh tơ Jêhôasa kon drŏ-nglo Jêhôahas sâu Jêhu, pơtao đe Isơrael khan: “Năm bĕ tơ âu wă kơ bơ̆n tơ'bơ̆p 'bôh băl muh măt.”"
"And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, “The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son as wife’; and a wild beast that was in Lebanon passed by and trampled the thistle.","Jêhôas, pơtao đe Isơrael tơl Amasia pơtao đe Juđa: “'Long jơla oei tơ char Liban đei pơtruh nơ̆r ăn kơ 'long hơngo tơ char Liban khan: ‘Ăn bĕ kơ kon adruh ih oei pơm akăn kơ kon tơdăm inh.’ Na đei sem bri đơ̆ng char Liban rok noh, na pơjuă lê̆ đĭ 'long jơla noh."
"Indeed you say that you have defeated the Edomites, and your heart is lifted up to boast. Stay at home now; why should you meddle with trouble, that you should fall—you and Judah with you?”","Ih khan: Lăm to inh blah iŏk boih char Eđôm na jơhngơ̆m ih pơrŏ pơang pơư kơdih akâu.

"But Amaziah would not heed, for it came from God, that He might give them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought the gods of Edom.","Mă-lei Amasia ưh kơ wă mơ̆ng, yua kơ tơdrong âu đơ̆ng Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei wă pơjao lu sư lăm ti Jêhôas, yua kơ đơ̆ng lu sư chơchă kơkuh kơ yang bơngai Eđôm."
"So Joash king of Israel went out; and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced one another at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah.","Jêhôas pơtao Isơrael tŏk blah sư păng Amasia pơtao Juđa tơblah băl tơ pơlei Bêt Sêmes lăm dêh char Juđa."
"And Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man fled to his tent.","Khŭl linh Isơrael druh blah khŭl linh Juđa, khŭl linh Juđa kơdâu brŏk tơ anih lu sư kơdih kơdih."
"Then Joash the king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth Shemesh; and he brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate—four hundred cubits.","Tơ Bêt Sêmes Jêhôas pơtao Isơrael rôp Amasia pơtao đe Juđa kon drŏ-nglo Jôas, sâu Ahasia, chông ba sư tơ pơlei Jêrusalem; lu sư teh tơlơ̆ pơrăm lê̆ dur pơlei Jêrusalem iŏk đơ̆ng 'Măng Jang Êphraim dĭng truh tơ 'Măng Jang Mum, minh chăl să kơjung 'bar-hrĕng hlok."
"And he took all the gold and silver, all the articles that were found in the house of God with Obed-Edom, the treasures of the king’s house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.","Sư iŏk đĭ hu, maih păng lu tơmam yua lăm hnam Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei, mă Ôbêt Eđôm bơngai wei tơmam noh; kư̆m iŏk dôm lu tơmam gĭt đơ̆ng lăm hnam pơtao hai; kư̆m đei rôp ba wă pơkơ̆ng lu bơngai nai, na lu sư wih brŏk tơ pơlei Samari."
"Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel.","Amasia, kon drŏ-nglo Jôas, pơtao đe Juđa, oei arih mơjĭt-pơđăm sơnăm dơ̆ng đơ̆ng rŏng kơ Jêhôas kon drŏ-nglo Jêhôahas pơtao Isơrael lôch."
"Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, from first to last, indeed are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?","Lu tơdrong jang nai Amasia đei pơm iŏk đơ̆ng blŭng-a truh tơ tôch đe đei chih lăm sơ̆p hla bơar lu pơtao Juđa păng Isơrael?"
"After the time that Amaziah turned away from following the LORD, they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there.","Đơ̆ng chăl Amasia achăng lê̆ Kră Yang, đơ̆ng noh na đei đe pơđâu wă pơm kơnê̆ kơ sư tơ pơlei Jêrusalem, sư kơdâu ôn tơ pơlei Lakis; đe druh sư păng pơlôch hloi sư tơ noh."
"Then they brought him on horses and buried him with his fathers in the City of Judah.","Đe chơ ba akâu sư hăm aseh, 'bŭ sư lăm Pơlei Đawit lăm char Juđa hơdai lu 'bok sư."
"Now all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.","Đĭ-đăng kon pơlei Juđa pôk Usia pơm pơtao pơgơ̆r pơtrơp 'bă sư Amasia, sư 'nao lăp mơjĭt-tơdrâu sơnăm."
"He built Elath and restored it to Judah, after the king rested with his fathers.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ 'bă sư lôch pơdơh wih hơdai lu 'bok sư, sư pơjing ming pơlei Êlat wă tơwih ăn kơ char Juđa."
"Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem.","Usia 'nao lăp mơjĭt-tơdrâu sơnăm 'bơ̆t sư pơm pơtao, sư pơgơ̆r pơđăm-jĭt 'bar sơnăm tơ pơlei Jêrusalem; mĕ sư anăn Jêkôlia đơ̆ng pơlei Jêrusalem."
"And he did what was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.","Sư pơm tơdrong 'lơ̆ng tơpăt 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, rok thoi 'bă sư Amasia đei pơm boih."
"He sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God; and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him prosper.","Sư chă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei đĭ lăm chăl Sachari, bơngai bơtho sư băt hli yom kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei.

"Now he went out and made war against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities around Ashdod and among the Philistines.","Sư iung tơblah hăm lu bơngai Philistin, blah tơlơ̆ dur pơlei Gat, blah pơchah dur Japnê păng dur Asdôt: Sư man pơdơ̆ng ming lơ pơlei lăm tơring Asdôt păng tơ anih nai lăm teh đak Philistin."
"God helped him against the Philistines, against the Arabians who lived in Gur Baal, and against the Meunites.","Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei tơgŭm sư kĕ jei blah lu kon pơlei Philistin, bơngai Arâp oei tơ lăm pơlei Gur Baal, klaih kơ noh lu bơngai Mêunit."
"Also the Ammonites brought tribute to Uzziah. His fame spread as far as the entrance of Egypt, for he became exceedingly strong.","Kon pơlei Ammôn kư̆m athei ra ăn jên kơ Usia; đe pơư kơ sư jơ̆p-jang đe ang kơ sư jơ̆p truh tơ dêh Êyiptơ, yua kơ sư rai pran kơtang tơpă."
"And Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate, and at the corner buttress of the wall; then he fortified them.","Usia kư̆m pơm tơiung lu hnam thôt lăm pơlei Jêrusalem, 'bơ̆t 'Măng Jang Mum, 'Măng Jang Thŭng, 'bơ̆t dur suăn pơm kơjăp hloh."
"Also he built towers in the desert. He dug many wells, for he had much livestock, both in the lowlands and in the plains; he also had farmers and vinedressers in the mountains and in Carmel, for he loved the soil.","Sư kư̆m pơm lơ hnam thôt tơ lăm tơmăn glă păng đei sir sơlŭng đak, yua kơ sư đei sem dơrong tơ kơpal groi tơ lăm thŭng glă; kư̆m đei lơ bơngai pơm mir, pơgar hơmu tơ kơpal kông groi păng tơ teh mơ̆r, pơtao sư 'maih jang mir 'ba."
"Moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting men who went out to war by companies, according to the number on their roll as prepared by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king’s captains.","Usia đei khŭl linh hơmet pơhrăm gơh năm tơblah, asong kơ khŭl năm kiơ̆ thoi bre Jêiêl bơngai chih hla bơar păng Maaseia yŏng jô̆ linh bơ̆jang ala kơ Hanania pơgơ̆r.

"The total number of chief officers of the mighty men of valor was two thousand six hundred.","Jô̆ đĭ-đăng lu yŏng kơdră adrĕch 'bă, wă khan lu bơngai nuih pran đei 'bar-rơbâu tơdrâu-hrĕng 'nu."
"And under their authority was an army of three hundred and seven thousand five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.","Lu sư pơgơ̆r khŭl linh đei pêng-hrĕng tơpơh-rơbâu pơđăm-hrĕng 'nu, lu bơngai nuih ngăl, wă tơgŭm pơtao tơblah hăm lu bơngai ayăt."
"Then Uzziah prepared for them, for the entire army, shields, spears, helmets, body armor, bows, and slings to cast stones.","Usia hơmet pơchĕp ăn kơ khŭl linh, khêl, đao tơju, môk mam, ao lŏ mam, hră păng 'brơ̆m tơmo wă prah."
"And he made devices in Jerusalem, invented by skillful men, to be on the towers and the corners, to shoot arrows and large stones. So his fame spread far and wide, for he was marvelously helped till he became strong.","Lăm pơlei Jêrusalem pơtao athei lu bơngai hơgei hơjơ̆m pơm kơmăi wă prah 'brơ̆m păng prah tơmo tih, tah tơ rim hnam thôt păng tơ rim mum pơlei.

"But when he was strong his heart was lifted up, to his destruction, for he transgressed against the LORD his God by entering the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense.","Wă sư pran kơtang boih jơhngơ̆m sư pơang truh tơ sư pơm yoch, pơm glăi hăm Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei sư kơdih; sư mơ̆t lăm hnam Kră Yang, soh tơmam 'bâu phu 'bơ̆t chơnang 'bok soi juăt kơ soh tơmam 'bâu phu."
"So Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him were eighty priests of the LORD—valiant men.","'Bok soi Asaria hơdai hăm tơhngam-jĭt 'nu 'bok soi Kră Yang bơngai nuih kơtang mơ̆t kiơ̆ Sư."
"And they withstood King Uzziah, and said to him, “It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the LORD, but for the priests, the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense. Get out of the sanctuary, for you have trespassed! You shall have no honor from the LORD God.”","Lu sư găn pơma kơ pơtao Usia: “Ơ pơtao Usia, ih ưh kơ trŏ gơh soh ôh tơmam 'bâu phu ăn kơ Kră Yang, 'nâu tơdrong jang lu 'bok soi pơm, lu kon sâu Arôn, đei 'măn lê̆ lu sư phara rơgoh wă kơ lu sư soh tơmam 'bâu phu.

"Then Uzziah became furious; and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense. And while he was angry with the priests, leprosy broke out on his forehead, before the priests in the house of the LORD, beside the incense altar.","Usia hil, ti sư oei chĕp get wă soh tơmam 'bâu phu; kơplah sư hil dêh kơ lu 'bok soi, đei hloi jĭ chin lĕch 'bơ̆t klĕng sư tơm măt lu 'bok soi, lăm hnam Kră Yang 'bơ̆t jê̆ chơnang soh tơmam 'bâu phu."
"And Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked at him, and there, on his forehead, he was leprous; so they thrust him out of that place. Indeed he also hurried to get out, because the LORD had struck him.","Asaria 'bok soi tơm păng đĭ-đăng lu 'bok soi nai lăng tơ sư, 'bôh sư đei jĭ chin 'bơ̆t klĕng na tơlĕch hloi sư đơ̆ng lăm noh păng kơdih akâu sư kư̆m 'maih lĕch, yua kơ Kră Yang phak sư."
"King Uzziah was a leper until the day of his death. He dwelt in an isolated house, because he was a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD. Then Jotham his son was over the king’s house, judging the people of the land.","Usia jĭ chin dĭng truh tơ sư lôch hloi; mưh jĭ chin athei oei hnam hơdrô̆ pha, ưh pă gơh mơ̆t lăm hnam Kră Yang dơ̆ng boih.

"Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, from first to last, the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz wrote.","Dôm tơdrong jang nai pơtao Usia đơ̆ng blŭng-a truh tơ tôch đei Êsai 'bok khan lê̆ adrol kon drŏ-nglo Amôt chih răk."
"So Uzziah rested with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings, for they said, “He is a leper.” Then Jotham his son reigned in his place.","Pơtao Usia lôch oei hơdai hăm 'bok yă, đe 'bŭ sư tơ bơsat lu pơtao jê̆ lu 'bok yă sư, đe khan; “sư jĭ chin.” Kon tơdăm sư Jôtham pơm pơtao pơtrơp sư."
"Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok.","Jôtham 'nao 'bar-jĭt pơđăm sơnăm sư pơm pơtao, sư pơgơ̆r mơjĭt-tơdrâu sơnăm lăm pơlei Jêrusalem; mĕ sư anăn Jêrusa kon drŏ-kăn Sadok."
"And he did what was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Uzziah had done (although he did not enter the temple of the LORD). But still the people acted corruptly.","Sư đei pơm lơ tơdrong 'lơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang thoi 'bă sư Usia đei pơm boih, mă-lei sư ưh kơ đei mơ̆t lăm hnam Kră Yang lu kon pơlei oei răm kiơ̆ trong kơnê̆."
"He built the Upper Gate of the house of the LORD, and he built extensively on the wall of Ophel.","Sư man ming 'Măng Jang Kơpal hnam Kră Yang păng kư̆m đei man pơdơ̆ng ming dur tơ groi Ôphel."
"Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built fortresses and towers.","Sư kư̆m đei man pơjing lu pơlei lăm tơring groi kông char Juđa păng pơm pơjing lu kơđông linh lu hnam thôt tơ lăm 'long kơdrơ̆ng."
"He also fought with the king of the Ammonites and defeated them. And the people of Ammon gave him in that year one hundred talents of silver, ten thousand kors of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. The people of Ammon paid this to him in the second and third years also.","Sư tơblah hăm pơtao bơngai Ammôn jei sư.

"So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the LORD his God.","Thoi noh Jôtham jing pran kơtang, yua kơ sư năm kiơ̆ trong tơpăt 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei sư."
"Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars and his ways, indeed they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.","Dôm tơdrong jang nai mă Jôtham đei pơm, dôm tơdrong tơblah wang păng trong mă sư yak, chih răk pơđĭ tơ lăm sơ̆p hla bơar lu pơtao Isơrael păng pơtao Juđa."
"He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.","Sư 'nao lăp 'bar-jĭt pơđăm sơnăm 'bơ̆t sư pơm pơtao păng sư pơgơ̆r đei mơjĭt-tơdrâu sơnăm lăm Jêrusalem."
"So Jotham rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the City of David. Then Ahaz his son reigned in his place.","Sư lôch pơdơh hơdai lu 'bok sư, đe 'bŭ sư lăm pơlei Đawit; đơ̆ng noh Ahas kon drŏ-nglo sư iung pơgơ̆r pơm pơtao pơtrơp sư."
"Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and he did not do what was right in the sight of the LORD, as his father David had done.","Ahas sư 'nao 'bar-jĭt sơnăm 'bơ̆t sư pơm pơtao; sư pơgơ̆r mơjĭt-tơdrâu sơnăm lăm pơlei Jêrusalem, sư ưh kơ đei pơm 'lơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang thoi 'bok sư Đawit đei pơm"
"For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made molded images for the Baals.","Sư kiơ̆ lu pơtao Isơrael, na kư̆m pơm tuh man rup yang Baal."
"He burned incense in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, and burned his children in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.","Sư soh pơyơ̆r tơmam 'bâu phu lăm Thŭng Ben Hinôm păng 'buh pơyơ̆r lu kon drŏ-nglo sư kơdih lăm ŭnh pơm tơmam soi, kiơ̆ kơ tơdrong kơnê̆ krưp dêh tơpă lu kon pơlei mă Kră Yang puh tơweh lê̆ lu sư đơ̆ng anăp lu bơngai Isơrael."
"And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.","Lu sư pơyơ̆r tơmam soi păng soh 'long 'bâu phu tơ lu anih kơjung, tơ kơpal groi păng tơ ala tơnơm 'long đei yơ̆p Să."
"Therefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria. They defeated him, and carried away a great multitude of them as captives, and brought them to Damascus. Then he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who defeated him with a great slaughter.","Yua kơ thoi noh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Sư jao sư tơ lăm ti pơtao char Siri; khŭl linh Siri blah rôp lu sư lơ pơm bơnă păng chông ba tơ pơlei Đamas.

"For Pekah the son of Remaliah killed one hundred and twenty thousand in Judah in one day, all valiant men, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.","lăm minh năr Pêka kon drŏ-nglo Rêmalia, đei pơlôch minh-hrĕng 'bar-jĭt rơbâu 'nu linh bơngai Juđa, tă kơ lu linh mă nuih kơtang ngăl, yua kơ lu sư achăng lê̆ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei 'bok lu sư."
"Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king’s son, Azrikam the officer over the house, and Elkanah who was second to the king.","Sikri minh 'nu bơngai nuih kơtang đơ̆ng char Êphraim pơlôch Maaseia, kon drŏ-nglo pơtao, Asrikam Yŏng wei hnam pơtao păng Êlkana, kơiĕng pơtao."
"And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand women, sons, and daughters; and they also took away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.","Khŭl linh Isơrael rôp 'bar-hrĕng rơbâu 'nu lu 'nhŏng oh lu sư pơm bơnă, drŏ-kăn, kon hơ'lơ̆p drŏ-nglo, drŏ-kăn păng kư̆m đei blah iŏk lu mŭk tơmam chĕp ba tơ pơlei Samari."
"But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded; and he went out before the army that came to Samaria, and said to them: “Look, because the LORD God of your fathers was angry with Judah, He has delivered them into your hand; but you have killed them in a rage that reaches up to heaven.","Tơ noh, đei minh 'nu 'bok khan lê̆ adrol Kră Yang anăn sư Ôdet, năm sơng lu linh brŏk tơ pơlei Samari păng khan: “'Nâu yua kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei 'bok lu iĕm hil kơ lu bơngai Juđa, na Sư đei pơjao đe Juđa lăm ti iĕm; mă-lei lu iĕm pơlôch lu sư lăm năr iĕm hil blĕk dêh mah truh tơ plĕnh."
"And now you propose to force the children of Judah and Jerusalem to be your male and female slaves; but are you not also guilty before the LORD your God?","Dang ei iĕm wă 'maih rôp lu bơngai Juđa păng lu bơngai lăm pơlei Jêrusalem pơm đĭch drŏ-nglo pơm đam drŏ-kăn kơ lu iĕm hă?

"Now hear me, therefore, and return the captives, whom you have taken captive from your brethren, for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you.”","Na dang ei mơ̆ng bĕ inh, tơbrŏk đĭ-đăng lu bơnă mă đêl lu iĕm rôp noh lu 'nhŏng oh iĕm kơdih 'mơ̆i. Kră Yang oei hil mĭl kơ lu iĕm.”"
"Then some of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against those who came from the war","Kơplah noh đei lu bơngai yŏng pơgơ̆r đơ̆ng lăm lu bơngai Êphraim, Asaria kon drŏ-nglo Jôhanan, Bêrekia kon drŏ-nglo Mêsilemôt, Jêhiskia kon drŏ-nglo Sallum păng Amasa kon drŏ-nglo Hatlai, iung găn lu bơngai mă 'nao brŏk đơ̆ng tơblah"
"and said to them, “You shall not bring the captives here, for we already have offended the LORD. You intend to add to our sins and to our guilt; for our guilt is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.”","Na lu sư khan: “Iĕm 'nĕ kơ tơmơ̆t lu bơnă tơ âu; Kơnh lu bơ̆n gô pơm yoch hăm Kră Yang, lu iĕm wă pơklăm thim tơdrong yoch lu bơ̆n rai dêh, yua kơ tơdrong yoch bơ̆n tih dêh boih na Kră Yang hil mĭl tơtŏ dêh truh kơ bơngai Isơrael.”"
"So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the leaders and all the assembly.","Thoi noh lu linh achăng lê̆ lu bơnă păng lu tơmam đêl lu sư blah iŏk 'bơ̆t anăp lu yŏng pơgơ̆r păng lu tơpôl kon pơlei oei akŭm."
"Then the men who were designated by name rose up and took the captives, and from the spoil they clothed all who were naked among them, dressed them and gave them sandals, gave them food and drink, and anointed them; and they let all the feeble ones ride on donkeys. So they brought them to their brethren at Jericho, the city of palm trees. Then they returned to Samaria.","Lu bơngai drŏ-nglo mă đei anăn lu sư adrol hei iung chông lu bơnă lĕch păng iŏk hơbĕn ao đơ̆ng blah iŏk noh pơhrŭk ăn kơ lu bơnă yua kơ đei lu mơ'nah akâu hoh păng tơ'bot ăn kơ lu sư chơkhŏ, ăn sŏng sa păng pik ăn pơgang păng chơ ba lu bơngai rơmơ̆n pă kĕ yak hăm aseh iĕ, đơ̆ng noh ba lu sư wih brŏk tơ 'nhŏng oh lu sư tơ pơlei Jêrikô, pơlei 'long gol; đơ̆ng noh lu sư wih brŏk tơ pơlei Samari."
"At the same time King Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria to help him.","Kơplah noh pơtao Ahas wơh bơngai năm apinh pơtao Asiri dŏng tơgŭm"
"For again the Edomites had come, attacked Judah, and carried away captives.","yua kơ kon pơlei Eđôm iung blah kon pơlei Juđa dơ̆ng, đei rôp ba lơ bơngai pơm bơnă."
"The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland and of the South of Judah, and had taken Beth Shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Sochoh with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages; and they dwelt there.","Kon pơlei Philistin kư̆m iung blah lu pơlei lăm tơring kông groi păng tơring tơ gah gơal lăm char Juđa.

"For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel, for he had encouraged moral decline in Judah and had been continually unfaithful to the LORD.","Yua kơ đơ̆ng Ahas, pơtao đe Isơrael,a na Kră Yang tơhuŏng lu bơngai Juđa, yua kơ Ahas pơm kơnê̆ lăm Juđa, ưh kơ chu Kră Yang."
"Also Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria came to him and distressed him, and did not assist him.","Tiglat Philêser pơtao Asiri năm pơgŏ pơđep Ahas, tơplih kơ tơgŭm sư."
"For Ahaz took part of the treasures from the house of the LORD, from the house of the king, and from the leaders, and he gave it to the king of Assyria; but he did not help him.","Ahas iŏk tơmam đơ̆ng lăm hnam akŭm Kră Yang, đơ̆ng lăm hnam pơtao păng kư̆m iŏk đơ̆ng lu yŏng pơgơ̆r ra ăn kơ pơtao Asiri; mă-lei kư̆m ưh kơ đei tơgŭm sư kiơ."
"Now in the time of his distress King Ahaz became increasingly unfaithful to the LORD. This is that King Ahaz.","Lăm kơplah đei tơdrong truh pơmat-tat, Ahas rai pơm yoch hăm Kră Yang"
"For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus which had defeated him, saying, “Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, I will sacrifice to them that they may help me.” But they were the ruin of him and of all Israel.","Sư kơkuh pơyơ̆r tơmam soi ăn kơ lu yang pơlei Đamas, kon pơlei mă blah sư; sư tơchĕng khan: “Yua kơ lu yang pơtao Asiri dŏng tơgŭm lu sư boih, na inh gô soi sơmah kơ lu yang noh, wă kơ lu yang noh kư̆m dŏng tơgŭm inh.” Mă tơpă lu yang noh rai pơrăm sư păng lu bơngai Isơrael."
"So Ahaz gathered the articles of the house of God, cut in pieces the articles of the house of God, shut up the doors of the house of the LORD, and made for himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem.","Ahas iŏk lu tơmam yua lăm hnam Kră Yang, na teh pơchah lê̆ păng tang chĭt lê̆ 'măng hnam Kră Yang; na sư pơdơ̆ng chơnang soi tơ rim mum trong lăm pơlei Jêrusalem."
"And in every single city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathers.","Tơ rim pơlei lăm char Juđa, sư pơjing pơdơ̆ng lu anih kơjung wă soh tơmam 'bâu phu ăn kơ lu yang nai, wă tơblĕk Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei 'bok sư."
"Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, from first to last, indeed they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.","Dôm tơdrong jang sư pơm păng dôm trong sư yak lăm chăl arih sư, iŏk đơ̆ng blŭng-a truh tơ tôch, đe đei chih lăm sơ̆p hla bơar lu pơtao Juđa păng Isơrael."
"So Ahaz rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem; but they did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel. Then Hezekiah his son reigned in his place.","Ahas lôch oei hơdai pơdơh hăm lu 'bok sư păng đe 'bŭ sư lăm pơlei Jêrusalem; mă-lei ưh kơ đei 'bŭ tah hơdai hăm bơsat lu pơtao Isơrael. Hesekia kon drŏ-nglo sư pơm pơtao pơgơ̆r pơtrơp sư."
"Hezekiah became king when he was twenty-five years old, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Abijah the daughter of Zechariah.","Hesekia 'nao lăp 'bar-jĭt pơđăm sơnăm kơplah sư pơm pơtao; sư pơgơ̆r oei lăm pơlei Jêrusalem 'bar-jĭt tơsĭn sơnăm; mĕ sư anăn Abija kon drŏ-kăn Sachari."
"And he did what was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father David had done.","Sư pơm tơdrong 'lơ̆ng tơpăt 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang thoi Đawit 'bok sư đei pơm boih."
"In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of the LORD and repaired them.","Khei mônh sơnăm blŭng-a sư pơgơ̆r sư pơih 'măng hnam akŭm Kră Yang păng hơmet ming."
"Then he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them in the East Square","Sư krao lu 'bok soi păng bơngai Lêwi, akŭm lu sư tơ anih cham gah hơlĕch."
"and said to them: “Hear me, Levites! Now sanctify yourselves, sanctify the house of the LORD God of your fathers, and carry out the rubbish from the holy place.","Sư khan: “Ơ bơngai Lêwi, mơ̆ng inh bĕ!

"For our fathers have trespassed and done evil in the eyes of the LORD our God; they have forsaken Him, have turned their faces away from the dwelling place of the LORD, and turned their backs on Him.","Lu 'bok bơ̆n sơ̆ pơm glăi, pơm tơdrong kơnê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu bơ̆n; lu sư achăng hŭt lê̆ Kră Yang boih, đê̆ ưh pă 'maih lăng boih Anih Kră Yang oei păng tơwih rŏng kơ Sư."
"They have also shut up the doors of the vestibule, put out the lamps, and have not burned incense or offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel.","Lu sư kư̆m chĭt lê̆ 'măng kơdeng, tơpăt lê̆ ŭnh kơđeng, ưh pă soh tơmam 'bâu phu păng ưh pă pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'buh tơ anih rơgoh Kră Yang Isơrael."
"Therefore the wrath of the LORD fell upon Judah and Jerusalem, and He has given them up to trouble, to desolation, and to jeering, as you see with your eyes.","Thoi ei na Kră Yang hil mĭl kơ lu bơngai Juđa păng kon pơlei Jêrusalem, Sư pơm ăn kơ đe hli tơrơ păng ăn kơ đe hiĕk ăr, thoi lu iĕm đei 'bôh tơm măt boih."
"For indeed, because of this our fathers have fallen by the sword; and our sons, our daughters, and our wives are in captivity.","Yua kơ thoi noh na 'bă 'bok bơ̆n lôch răm kơ đao gưm, lu kon drŏ-nglo drŏ-kăn akăn bơ̆n đe rôp ba pơm bơnă."
"“Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel, that His fierce wrath may turn away from us.","Dang ei jơhngơ̆m inh wă pơm tơdrong pơgơ̆p hăm Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael, wă kơ tơdrong hil mĭl Sư ngach."
"My sons, do not be negligent now, for the LORD has chosen you to stand before Him, to serve Him, and that you should minister to Him and burn incense.”","Ơ lu đe kon inh 'nĕ pă pơhiơ̆, yua kơ Kră Yang đei rơih iŏk boih lu iĕm jing đĭch đam Sư, wă kơ dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp Sư, bơ̆jang kơ Sư soh tơmam 'bâu phu kơ Sư.”"
"Then these Levites arose: Mahath the son of Amasai and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah and Eden the son of Joah","'Nâu lu bơngai Lêwi iung jang: Đơ̆ng adrĕch Kôhat, đei Mahat kon drŏ-nglo Amasai, Jôel kon drŏ-nglo Asaria; đơ̆ng adrĕch Mêrari, đei Kis kon drŏ-nglo Apđi; Asaria kon drŏ-nglo Jêhalêlel; đơ̆ng adrĕch Gersôn, đei Jôa kon drŏ-nglo Simma, Êđen kon drŏ-nglo Jôa"
"of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeiel; of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah","đơ̆ng adrĕch Êlisaphan đei: Simri păng Jêuel, đơ̆ng adrĕch Asap đei: Sachari păng Matania."
"of the sons of Heman, Jehiel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.","Đơ̆ng adrĕch Hêman đei: Jêhiel păng Simei; đơ̆ng adrĕch Jêđuthun đei: Sêmaia păng Usiel."
"And they gathered their brethren, sanctified themselves, and went according to the commandment of the king, at the words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD.","Lu sư akŭm lu 'nhŏng oh lu sư păng hơmet kơdih akâu rơgoh, na pơm kiơ̆ thoi pơtao đei bơtho khan kiơ̆ kơ nơ̆r Kră Yang hơmet rơgoh hnam Kră Yang."
"Then the priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD to cleanse it, and brought out all the debris that they found in the temple of the LORD to the court of the house of the LORD. And the Levites took it out and carried it to the Brook Kidron.","Lu 'bok soi mơ̆t lăm hnam Kră Yang wă hơmet rơgoh; dôm tơmam kơnê̆ 'mê̆-'mach 'bôh lăm hnam Kră Yang, lu sư iŏk tơlĕch lê̆ tơ đaih 'bơ̆t cham hnam Kră Yang; đơ̆ng noh lu bơngai Lêwi dônh iŏk, na năm tung klơ̆m hŭt lê̆ tơ thong Kidrôn."
"Now they began to sanctify on the first day of the first month, and on the eighth day of the month they came to the vestibule of the LORD. So they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days, and on the sixteenth day of the first month they finished.","Năr mônh lăm khei mônh, lu sư pơtơm hơmet hnam Kră Yang rơgoh, truh năr tơhngam lăm khei noh lu sư hơmet rơgoh cham truh tơ kơđeng hnam Kră Yang.

"Then they went in to King Hezekiah and said, “We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, the altar of burnt offerings with all its articles, and the table of the showbread with all its articles.","Lu sư mơ̆t lăm hnam pơtao Hesekia păng khan: “Lu nhôn đei hơmet rơgoh đĭ boih hnam Kră Yang, chơnang soi pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'buh păng đĭ tơmam yua, gô 'bang dan 'bĕng păng đĭ tơmam yua sư."
"Moreover all the articles which King Ahaz in his reign had cast aside in his transgression we have prepared and sanctified; and there they are, before the altar of the LORD.”","Đĭ-đăng lu tơmam mă đơ̆ng pơtao Ahas iŏk lê̆ 'bơ̆t Sư ưh kơchu Kră Yang lăm chăl sư pơgơ̆r, na lu nhôn dan hơmet păng pơm rơgoh; to, đĭ-đăng lu tơmam noh dan 'bơ̆t anăp chơnang soi Kră Yang.”"
"Then King Hezekiah rose early, gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the LORD.","Pơtao Hesekia iung đơ̆ng hrôih krao akŭm lu yŏng pơgơ̆r lăm pơlei, năm tŏk tơ hnam Kră Yang"
"And they brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats for a sin offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, and for Judah. Then he commanded the priests, the sons of Aaron, to offer them on the altar of the LORD.","lu Sư chĕp ba tơpơh tŏ rơmo tơno, tơpơh tŏ triu tơno, tơpơh tŏ triu kon păng tơpơh tŏ bơbe tơno wă pơm tơmam soi pơyơ̆r huai đơ̆ng yoch kơ char sư, kơ hnam rơgoh păng kơ kon pơlei Juđa.

"So they killed the bulls, and the priests received the blood and sprinkled it on the altar. Likewise they killed the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar. They also killed the lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar.","Lu sư 'bet rơmo tơno, 'bok soi mong iŏk pham sư na tơtreh tơ chơnang soi, 'bet triu tơno, mong pham tơtreh tơ kơpal chơnang; lu sư kư̆m pơlôch lu triu kon, kư̆m tơtreh pham tơ kơpal chơnang soi."
"Then they brought out the male goats for the sin offering before the king and the assembly, and they laid their hands on them.","Lu sư kư̆m rôp iŏk bơbe tơno wă pơm tơmam soi huai đơ̆ng yoch năm tơ anăp pơtao păng lu kon pơlei akŭm, dan ti lu sư kơpal lu kon sem soi pơyơ̆r noh"
"And the priests killed them; and they presented their blood on the altar as a sin offering to make an atonement for all Israel, for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering be made for all Israel.","na 'bok soi pơlôch lu bơbe tơno noh păng mong pham tơtreh tơ kơpal chơnang soi noh wă pơm tơmam soi huai đơ̆ng yoch kơ đĭ-đăng kơ lu kon pơlei Isơrael, yua kơ pơtao đei athei khan pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'buh wă huai đơ̆ng yoch kơ đĭ kon pơlei Isơrael."
"And he stationed the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with stringed instruments, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, of Gad the king’s seer, and of Nathan the prophet; for thus was the commandment of the LORD by His prophets.","Pơtao sư dan 'măn lê̆ lu bơngai Lêwi lăm Hnam Kră Yang chĕp chhar, brŏ dung, tĭng-nĭng kiơ̆ kơ Đawit, Gat 'bok 'bôh adrol, jang kơ pơtao păng Nathan 'bok khan lê̆ adrol, pơkă noh đơ̆ng Kră Yang ăn kơ lu 'bok khan lê̆ adrol tơbăt."
"The Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.","Lu bơngai Lêwi chĕp brŏ đơ̆ng Đawit, lu 'bok soi chĕp keng"
"Then Hezekiah commanded them to offer the burnt offering on the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD also began, with the trumpets and with the instruments of David king of Israel.","Hesekia athei đe pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'buh, kơplah đe oei pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'buh; kư̆m đei hơri bơnê kơ Kră Yang, hlôm keng reh brŏ đơ̆ng Đawit pơtao đe Isơrael, hơdai."
"So all the assembly worshiped, the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded; all this continued until the burnt offering was finished.","Đĭ-đăng kon pơlei drap kơkuh kơplah lu bơngai oei hơri, oei hlôm keng truh tơ pơyơ̆r tơmam soi keh đang."
"And when they had finished offering, the king and all who were present with him bowed and worshiped.","Wă đang kơ pơyơ̆r tơmam soi boih, pơtao păng đĭ-đăng lu bơngai oei hơdai pơtao kŭp kơ̆l drap kơkuh bơnê."
"Moreover King Hezekiah and the leaders commanded the Levites to sing praise to the LORD with the words of David and of Asaph the seer. So they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshiped.","Pơtao Hesekia păng lu yŏng pơgơ̆r athei bơngai Lêwi hat hơri bơnê kơ Kră Yang hăm nơ̆r hơri đơ̆ng Đawit păng Asap pơm, Asap, 'bok mă juăt kơ 'bôh adrol; lu sư hat hơri chơt hiôk kŭp kơ̆l kơkuh."
"Then Hezekiah answered and said, “Now that you have consecrated yourselves to the LORD, come near, and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD.” So the assembly brought in sacrifices and thank offerings, and as many as were of a willing heart brought burnt offerings.","Hesekia khan: “Dang ei lu iĕm đei hơmet akâu kơdih rơgoh ăn kơ Kră Yang boih; lei na năm tơ âu, chĕp ba tơmam soi pơyơ̆r bơnê mơ̆t tơ lăm Hnam Kră Yang.

"And the number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bulls, one hundred rams, and two hundred lambs; all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD.","Dôm lu sem tơmam soi 'buh pơyơ̆r đơ̆ng lu bơngai tơpôl akŭm pơyơ̆r chĕp ba đei tơpơh-jĭt tŏ rơmo tơno, minh-hrĕng tŏ triu tơno păng đei 'bar-hrĕng tŏ triu kon; lu sư yua sem dơrong noh pơyơ̆r wă pơm tơmam soi 'buh ăn kơ Kră Yang."
"The consecrated things were six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep.","Jô̆ tơmam soi rơgoh tơdrâu-hrĕng tŏ rơmo tơno păng pêng-rơbâu tŏ triu hăm bơbe."
"But the priests were too few, so that they could not skin all the burnt offerings; therefore their brethren the Levites helped them until the work was ended and until the other priests had sanctified themselves, for the Levites were more diligent in sanctifying themselves than the priests.","Mă-lei lu 'bok soi lu sư tŏ sĕt dêh ưh kơ kĕ kơ tam lŏng đĭ akar kon sem tơmam soi 'buh ôh; na đei lu 'nhŏng oh sư bơngai Lêwi hơmet akâu lu sư rơgoh kư̆m wang tơgŭm tơdrong jang noh dĭng truh keh, yua kơ lu bơngai Lêwi đĭ jơhngơ̆m pơyơ̆r akâu lu Sư hloh kơ lu 'bok soi."
"Also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings and with the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order.","Kŭm đei lơ tơmam soi 'buh hăm rơmă đơ̆ng tơmam soi 'blŏk bơnê păng tơmam soi huch hơdai hăm tơmam soi 'buh.

"Then Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced that God had prepared the people, since the events took place so suddenly.","Hesekia păng đĭ-đăng kon pơlei lu sư chơt hiôk kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei đei asong ăn kơ lu kon pơlei Sư na tơdrong jang âu tĕnh jah keh đang."
"And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the Passover to the LORD God of Israel.","Hesekia đei gơih nơ̆r sư kơ đĭ-đăng bơngai Isơrael păng lu bơngai Juđa, sư kư̆m chih hla bơar gơih ăn kơ bơngai Êphraim păng lu adrĕch Manase, wă kơ lu sư năm tơ Hnam Kră Yang tơ pơlei Jêrusalem, wă wang pơm giĕng Năm Brih 'blŏk hơdơ̆r kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael."
"For the king and his leaders and all the assembly in Jerusalem had agreed to keep the Passover in the second month.","Pơtao păng lu yŏng pơgơ̆r hăm đĭ-đăng lu kon pơlei akŭm lăm pơlei Jêrusalem pơđâu băl, pơkă wă năm pơm giĕng Năm brih lăm khei mă 'bar"
"For they could not keep it at the regular time, because a sufficient number of priests had not consecrated themselves, nor had the people gathered together at Jerusalem.","Lu sư ưh kơ gơh năm pơm giĕng Năm Brih kơplah noh, yua kơ lu 'bok soi hơmet akâu kơdih rơgoh ưh tam mă tôm mah păng lu kon pơlei kư̆m tam tôm akŭm băl tơ pơlei Jêrusalem."
"And the matter pleased the king and all the assembly.","Pơtao păng đĭ-đăng lu kon pơlei lăng tơdă akŭm noh trŏ boih."
"So they resolved to make a proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, that they should come to keep the Passover to the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem, since they had not done it for a long time in the prescribed manner.","Lu sư tơtă pơkă wă chă roi tơbăt jơ̆p-jang kơ char Isơrael, iŏk đơ̆ng pơlei Bêrsêba truh tơ pơlei Đan, wă kơ kon pơlei năm pơm giĕng Năm Brih 'blŏk hơdơ̆r Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael tơ pơlei Jêrusalem; yua kơ lu sư ưh tam mă biơh năm pơm giĕng năm brih wă kơ 'blŏk hơdơ̆r kiơ̆ kơ tơdrong juăt đei pơkă sơ̆."
"Then the runners went throughout all Israel and Judah with the letters from the king and his leaders, and spoke according to the command of the king: “Children of Israel, return to the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel; then He will return to the remnant of you who have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria.","Thoi noh lu bơngai năm tơbăt tơ jơ̆p kơ dêh char Isơrael păng char Juđa năm ba hla bơar pơtao păng lu yŏng pơgơ̆r sư, kiơ̆ thoi pơtao đei pơkă khan: “Ơ kon sâu adrĕch Isơrael, wih brŏk bĕ tơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Abraham, Isăk păng Isơrael, wă kơ Sư kư̆m wih tơ lu iĕm bơngai mă oei hlot klaih đơ̆ng ti lu pơtao Asiri."
"And do not be like your fathers and your brethren, who trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, so that He gave them up to desolation, as you see.","'Nĕ pă pơm thoi 'bok păng 'nhŏng oh lu iĕm đei pơm yoch hăm Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei 'bok lu sư, na Kră Yang pơrăm lu sư krưp tơpă thoi lu iĕm 'bôh."
"Now do not be stiff-necked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves to the LORD; and enter His sanctuary, which He has sanctified forever, and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of His wrath may turn away from you.","'Nĕ pă arăng kơ̆l thoi lu 'bok iĕm; chu bĕ Kră Yang, năm tơ anih rơgoh Sư mă 'măn lê̆ pha rơgoh ling-lang.

"For if you return to the LORD, your brethren and your children will be treated with compassion by those who lead them captive, so that they may come back to this land; for the LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn His face from you if you return to Him.”","Tơdah lu iĕm wih brŏk tơ Kră Yang na 'nhŏng oh păng lu kon sâu iĕm gô đei mơnat 'bơ̆t anăp lu bơngai mă rôp lu sư pơm bơnă, lei na gô tơwih lu Sư brŏk tơ dêh char 'nâu, yua kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu iĕm Tơ'ngla găt băt 'mêm mơnat, huay pă tơwih rŏng kơ iĕm tơdah lu iĕm wih brŏk tơ Sư.”"
"So the runners passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, as far as Zebulun; but they laughed at them and mocked them.","Lu bơngai mă năm ba hla bơar năm tơ jơ̆p-jang đơ̆ng pơlei âu truh tơ pơlei nai lăm teh đak Êphraim, Manase păng truh tơ teh đak Sabulôn, đei bơngai hiĕk ăr che bơle kơ lu sư."
"Nevertheless some from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.","Mă-lei đei lu mơ'nah đơ̆ng lăm teh đak Aser, Manase, hăm teh đak Sabulôn chu tơjur akâu păng năm truh tơ pơlei Jêrusalem."
"Also the hand of God was on Judah to give them singleness of heart to obey the command of the king and the leaders, at the word of the LORD.","Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei kư̆m tơgŭm lu bơngai Juđa pơm ăn kơ lu sư lăp đon 'maih wă pơm kiơ̆ nơ̆r pơtao păng yŏng pơgơ̆r đei tơtă, kiơ̆ thoi nơ̆r Kră Yang."
"Now many people, a very great assembly, gathered at Jerusalem to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month.","Lăm khei 'bar đei lơ bơngai năm akŭm tơ pơlei Jêrusalem, đei minh khŭl akŭm tih tơpă đei lơlang lơlap kon bơngai wă pơm giĕng 'Bĕng ưh kơ đei 'Buih Pông."
"They arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and they took away all the incense altars and cast them into the Brook Kidron.","Lu sư iung iŏk hŭt lê̆ chơnang đe soi kơ yang nai lăm pơlei Jêrusalem păng chơnang soh 'long 'bâu phu, klơ̆m hŭt lê̆ đĭ tơ lăm thŭng Kidrôn."
"Then they slaughtered the Passover lambs on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought the burnt offerings to the house of the LORD.","Lăm năr mơjĭt-puăn khei 'bar, đe 'bet triu pơm giĕng Năm Brih; gah lu 'bok soi păng bơngai Lêwi 'bôh mơlâu, na hơmet akâu kơdih rơgoh păng chĕp lu kon sem pơm tơmam soi 'buh tơ Hnam Kră Yang."
"They stood in their place according to their custom, according to the Law of Moses the man of God; the priests sprinkled the blood received from the hand of the Levites.","Lu sư oei đơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anih lu sư kơdih, kiơ̆ thoi khôi juăt Môis bơngai Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei tơtă 'bok soi iŏk pham đơ̆ng bơngai Lêwi na tơtreh."
"For there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves; therefore the Levites had charge of the slaughter of the Passover lambs for everyone who was not clean, to sanctify them to the LORD.","Lăm khŭl akŭm đei lu mơ'nah tam mă hơmet akâu kơdih rơgoh, na bơngai Lêwi athei 'bet kon sem tơmam soi pơm giĕng Năm Brih ăn kơ lu sư, wă kơ lu Sư pơyơ̆r rơgoh ăn kơ Kră Yang."
"For a multitude of the people, many from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the Passover contrary to what was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, “May the good LORD provide atonement for everyone","Mă khan đei lơ mơ'nah đơ̆ng adrĕch Êphraim, Manase, Isakar păng Sabulôn tam mă hơmet akâu rơgoh kư̆m sa 'nhĕm giĕng Năm brih, ưh kơ kiơ̆ tơdrong juăt mă đei chih răk; mă-lei Hesekia krao khan ăn kơ lu sư"
"who prepares his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though he is not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary.”","“Hơpơi apinh Kră Yang Tơ'ngla dim, 'nĕ kơ jô̆ yo kơ lu bơngai mă đĭ jơhngơ̆m chă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu 'bok sư, mă khan lu sư tam kiơ̆ hơmet akâu kơdih rơgoh kiơ̆ thoi tơdrong juăt hnam akŭm rơgoh.”"
"And the LORD listened to Hezekiah and healed the people.","Kră Yang kơtơ̆ng bơih nơ̆r Hesekia krao khan, na pơklaih kon pơlei."
"So the children of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing to the LORD, accompanied by loud instruments.","Lu bơngai Isơrael oei tơ lăm pơlei Jêrusalem chơt hiôk pơm giĕng sa 'bĕng ưh kơ đei 'Buih Pông lăm tơpơh năr.

"And Hezekiah gave encouragement to all the Levites who taught the good knowledge of the LORD; and they ate throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.","Hesekia pơma pơhiôk jơhngơ̆m lu bơngai Lêwi đei đon hlôh wao bơ̆jang kơ Kră Yang.

"For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep, and the leaders gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep; and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.","Hesekia pơtao Juđa, đei asong ăn kơ tơpôl akŭm noh minh-rơbâu tŏ rơmo tơno păng tơpơh-rơbâu tŏ triu bơbe; lu yŏng pơgơ̆r kư̆m asong ăn kơ tơpôl akŭm minh-rơbâu tŏ rơmo tơno păng mơjĭt-rơbâu tŏ triu, bơbe.

"So there was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the time of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem.","Lăm pơlei Jêrusalem đei tơdrong chơt hiôk tih; đơ̆ng chăl Sôlômôn kon drŏ-nglo Đawit pơtao Isơrael, lăm pơlei Jêrusalem ưh tam biơh đei tơdrong chơt hiôk thoi noh."
"Then the priests, the Levites, arose and blessed the people, and their voice was heard; and their prayer came up to His holy dwelling place, to heaven.","Lu 'bok soi păng lu bơngai Lêwi iung sơkat pŭn hiôk ăn kơ kon pơlei; nơ̆r sơkat nơ̆r lu sư krao khan kơtơ̆ng truh tơ anih rơgoh Kră Yang, truh tơ plĕnh na Kră Yang tơl tơwih ăn pŭn hiôk."
"Now when all this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah and broke the sacred pillars in pieces, cut down the wooden images, and threw down the high places and the altars—from all Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh—until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned to their own cities, every man to his possession.","Wă đĭ-đăng tơdrong noh đang boih, lu bơngai Isơrael mă oei tơ noh lu sư năm tơ lu pơlei lăm char Juđa teh pơchah lê̆ lu jrăng gơ̆ng, teh pơhĕch lê̆ lu rup yang Asêria, pơrăm đĭ lu anih kơjung păng lu chơnang soi tơ lăm jơ̆p char Juđa, Bênjamin, Êphraim păng Manase dĭng pơrăm đi boih.

"And Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and the Levites according to their divisions, each man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and peace offerings, to serve, to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the camp of the LORD.","Hesekia klah asong lu 'bok soi păng lu bơngai Lêwi, kiơ̆ kơ khŭl tơdrong jang lu sư, wă pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'buh păng tơmam soi pơyơ̆r kơ 'blŏk bơnê, wă kơkuh bơnê păng hơri ư-ang tơ anih lu 'măng jang cham Hnam Kră Yang."
"The king also appointed a portion of his possessions for the burnt offerings: for the morning and evening burnt offerings, the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths and the New Moons and the set feasts, as it is written in the Law of the LORD.","Pơtao ăn tơmam soi sư kơdih wă pơyơ̆r pơm tơmam soi 'buh kiơ̆ pơgê kiơ̆ kơsơ̆, lăm năr giĕng Sa'bat, năr khei tơ'bang blŭng-a păng lăm lu năr giĕng tih kiơ̆ thoi đei chih răk lăm sơ̆p hla bơar khôi juăt Kră Yang."
"Moreover he commanded the people who dwelt in Jerusalem to contribute support for the priests and the Levites, that they might devote themselves to the Law of the LORD.","Sư kư̆m athei lu kon pơlei mă oei lăm pơlei Jêrusalem asong ăn tơmam kơ lu 'bok soi păng bơngai Lêwi, wă kơ lu sư gơh jao lu sư kơdih awih awăn kiơ̆ khôi juăt Kră Yang."
"As soon as the commandment was circulated, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of grain and wine, oil and honey, and of all the produce of the field; and they brought in abundantly the tithe of everything.","Mưh đei nơ̆r pơtao tơtă truh boih kon pơlei Isơrael năm ba tơmam pơyơ̆r plei blŭng-a lăm bơyan thoi 'ba hơ'bo, Sik hơmu, rơmă ôliwơ, đak sut păng lu tơmam plei đơ̆ng mir chŭn; lu sư kư̆m năm ba pơyơ̆r minh lăm mơjĭt đơ̆ng dôm tơmam, lơ tơpă."
"And the children of Israel and Judah, who dwelt in the cities of Judah, brought the tithe of oxen and sheep; also the tithe of holy things which were consecrated to the LORD their God they laid in heaps.","Bơngai Isơrael păng lu bơngai Juđa oei tơ lăm lu pơlei lăm char Juđa, kư̆m đei năm ba pơyơ̆r minh lăm mơjĭt lu sem dơrong rơmo, triu, bơbe pơyơ̆r minh lăm mơjĭt đơ̆ng dôm tơmam mă đei klah lê̆ pha 'lơ̆ng rơgoh ăn kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu sư; na dan hơdrom lê̆ minh 'bôt."
"In the third month they began laying them in heaps, and they finished in the seventh month.","Khei mă pêng lu sư pơtơm pơyơ̆r tơmam akŭm pơpôi minh 'bôt, đơ̆ng khei pêng truh tơ khei tơpơh."
"And when Hezekiah and the leaders came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD and His people Israel.","Wă Hesekia păng lu yŏng pơgơ̆r truh, 'bôh lu pôi noh na bơnê ư-ang kơ Kră Yang păng kon pơlei Isơrael."
"Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.","Hesekia apinh lu 'bok soi păng lu bơngai Lêwi gah pôi đe hơdrom lê̆ tơmam soi noh."
"And Azariah the chief priest, from the house of Zadok, answered him and said, “Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat and have plenty left, for the LORD has blessed His people; and what is left is this great abundance.”","Asaria 'bok soi tơm, đơ̆ng adrĕch Sadok, tơl sư khan: “Đơ̆ng lu kon pơlei pơtơm pơyơ̆r tơmam tơ Hnam Kră Yang lu nhôn đei sŏng sa mah păng kư̆m oei rơkah lơ, yua kơ Kră Yang ăn boih kơ kon pơlei sư đei pŭn hiôk; na mă đei rơkah lơ 'nâu."
"Now Hezekiah commanded them to prepare rooms in the house of the LORD, and they prepared them.","Hesekia athei đe hơmet lu anih mong tơ Hnam Kră Yang; na lu đe hơmet lu hnam noh."
"Then they faithfully brought in the offerings, the tithes, and the dedicated things; Cononiah the Levite had charge of them, and Shimei his brother was the next.","Đei jơhngơ̆m tơpăt ba pơyơ̆r lu tơmam noh, gah tơmam minh lăm mơjĭt păng tơmam rơgoh tah tơmơ̆t.

"Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.","Pơtao Hesekia păng Asaria, 'bok soi wei-lăng tơm lăm Hnam Kră Yang jao ăn kơ đe Jêhiêl, Asaria, Nahat, Asahel, Jêrimôt, Jôsabat, Êliel, Ismakia, Mahat păng Bênaia lu sư kư̆m bơngai tơgŭm wei-lăng đơ̆ng rŏng kơ Kônania păng Simei oh sư"
"Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the keeper of the East Gate, was over the freewill offerings to God, to distribute the offerings of the LORD and the most holy things.","Kôrê kon drŏ-nglo Imna, bơngai Lêwi bơngai wei 'Măng Jang Hơlĕch, sư yŏng wei-lăng tơmam đe pơyơ̆r kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei hăm jơhngơ̆m hiôk păng lu tơmam 'lơ̆ng rơgoh."
"And under him were Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, his faithful assistants in the cities of the priests, to distribute allotments to their brethren by divisions, to the great as well as the small.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ sư đei Êđen, Miniamin, Jêsua, Sêmaia, Amaria păng Sêkania, lu sư asong ăn tơmam noh kơ lăm lu pơlei 'bok soi lu 'bok soi asong kơ lu 'nhŏng oh sư, hơtŏ hơnơ̆ng mă 'lơ̆p mă 'lŏ, kiơ̆ kơ khŭl lu sư."
"Besides those males from three years old and up who were written in the genealogy, they distributed to everyone who entered the house of the LORD his daily portion for the work of his service, by his division","Kŭm asong kơ lu drŏ-nglo đei chih tơmơ̆t boih anăn lu sư lăm sơ̆p hla bơar jô̆ kiơ̆ adrĕch 'bok lu sư iŏk đơ̆ng pêng sơnăm tơ kơpal, kiơ̆ kơ khŭl lu sư gô mơ̆t bơ̆jang rim năr lăm hnam Kră Yang kiơ̆ kơ khŭl đei asong."

"and to all who were written in the genealogy—their little ones and their wives, their sons and daughters, the whole company of them—for in their faithfulness they sanctified themselves in holiness.","Lu 'bok soi đe kư̆m chih anăn lu sư hơdai hăm đĭ-đăng lu kon drŏ-nglo kon drŏ-kăn akăn lu sư, yua kơ lu sư tơpăt pơyơ̆r akâu kơdih."
"Also for the sons of Aaron the priests, who were in the fields of the common-lands of their cities, in every single city, there were men who were designated by name to distribute portions to all the males among the priests and to all who were listed by genealogies among the Levites.","Gah lu 'bok soi kon sâu Arôn, mă oei tơ mir na, tơ jê̆ kơ pơlei lu sư, dah oei tơ lăm rim pơlei nai, lu sư jang asong tơmam kơ đĭ-đăng kon drŏ-nglo lăm lu 'bok soi păng lăm lu bơngai Lêwi chih jô̆ boih lăm adrĕch 'bok lu sư."
"Thus Hezekiah did throughout all Judah, and he did what was good and right and true before the LORD his God.","Tơ jơ̆p lăm char Juđa, Hesekia pơm thoi noh, sư pơm tơdrong 'lơ̆ng tơpăt 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu sư."
"And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, in the law and in the commandment, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart. So he prospered.","Dôm tơdrong jang sư pơm, gah Hnam Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei gah tơdrong wei răk khôi juăt păng nơ̆r tơtă, gah tơdrong chă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei sư jang đĭ jơhngơ̆m, na tơdrong jang sư rai tŏk keh 'lơ̆ng."
"After these deeds of faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came and entered Judah; he encamped against the fortified cities, thinking to win them over to himself.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ lu tơdrong noh tơdrong mă Hesekia pơm 'lơ̆ng tơpăt noh, na Senacherip pơtao Asiri năm mơ̆t lăm char Juđa, wang lu pơlei tih kơjăp wă blah iŏk."
"And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come, and that his purpose was to make war against Jerusalem","Wă Hesekia 'bôh Senacherip năm wă kơ blah iŏk pơlei Jêrusalem"
"he consulted with his leaders and commanders to stop the water from the springs which were outside the city; and they helped him.","na sư krao akŭm lu yŏng pơgơ̆r păng lu bơngai yŏng linh nuih kơtang wă bơ̆ tu đak tơ 'nguaih kơ pơlei; đe noh tơgŭm sư mơ̆n."
"Thus many people gathered together who stopped all the springs and the brook that ran through the land, saying, “Why should the kings of Assyria come and find much water?”","Kon pơlei đei akŭm băl lơ tơpă, bơ̆ găn lê̆ lu tu đak ro rok tơring păng khan: “Liơ lu bơ̆n lê̆ lu pơtao Asiri năm chă 'bôh đak lơ dêh?”"
"And he strengthened himself, built up all the wall that was broken, raised it up to the towers, and built another wall outside; also he repaired the Millo in the City of David, and made weapons and shields in abundance.","Sư adrin, man tơiung ming dur mă đĭ păk hơlih lap gleh tơpă; hăm man lu hnam thôt kơpal noh!

"Then he set military captains over the people, gathered them together to him in the open square of the city gate, and gave them encouragement, saying","Sư kư̆m pơjao ăn chă yŏng linh wă pơgơ̆r wei-lăng kon pơlei na pơpôi akŭm lu sư hơdai lăm cham să 'bơ̆t 'măng jang pơlei, pơma pơlung hơtŏk jơhngơ̆m lu sư khan"
"“Be strong and courageous; do not be afraid nor dismayed before the king of Assyria, nor before all the multitude that is with him; for there are more with us than with him.","“Athei chơ̆n jơhngơ̆m nuih pran, 'nĕ kơ hli, 'nĕ kơ tơrơ 'bơ̆t anăp pơtao Asiri păng 'bơ̆t anăp lu linh kiơ̆ sư yua kơ đei Kră Yang Tih Hloh oei hơdai bơ̆n pran hloh kơ lu bơngai oei hăm sư"
"With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God, to help us and to fight our battles.” And the people were strengthened by the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.","Oei hăm lu sư noh kon bơngai hmă đĕch; bĕ gah bơ̆n đei Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu bơ̆n wă tơgŭm păng tơblah tang lu bơ̆n.” Kon pơlei đei jơhngơ̆m nuih đơ̆ng nơ̆r Hesekia pơtao Juđa."
"After this Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem (but he and all the forces with him laid siege against Lachish), to Hezekiah king of Judah, and to all Judah who were in Jerusalem, saying","Đang kơ noh, Senacherip, pơtao Asiri, hơdai hăm lu linh sư oei wang blah pơlei Lakis, kư̆m đei wơh lu Yŏng linh sư năm tơ pơtao Hesekia păng kon pơlei Juđa tơ pơlei Jêrusalem păng khan"
"“Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria: ‘In what do you trust, that you remain under siege in Jerusalem?","“Senacherip, pơtao Asiri, khan: ‘Lu iĕm gơnang kơ tơdrong kiơ, mă oei pơjăng pơlei Jêrusalem mă nhôn wang tăp boih thoi noh!"
"Does not Hezekiah persuade you to give yourselves over to die by famine and by thirst, saying, “The LORD our God will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assyria”?","Hăm trŏ Hesekia pơhlŭ pơlung wă jao iĕm pơngot rơhing na lôch dah kiơ? Sư khan: Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu bơ̆n gô dŏng pơklaih lu bơ̆n đơ̆ng ti pơtao Asiri noh."
"Has not the same Hezekiah taken away His high places and His altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, “You shall worship before one altar and burn incense on it”?","Hăm trŏ kơ đơ̆ng Hesekia mă đei pơrăm lê̆ lu anih kơjung păng chơnang soi kơ Kră Yang păng krao pơtơm kon pơlei Juđa păng kon pơlei Jêrusalem khan: Lu iĕm athei kơkuh păng soh tơmam 'bâu phu 'bơ̆t anăp kơ minh pôm chơnang soi 'nâu đĕch?"
"Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of other lands? Were the gods of the nations of those lands in any way able to deliver their lands out of my hand?","Lu iĕm ưh kơ băt hă tơdrong inh păng lu 'bok inh đei pơm kơ đĭ-đăng kon pơlei dêh char nai?

"Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed that could deliver his people from my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you from my hand?","Lăng lăm lu yang dôm dêh char mă lu 'bok inh đei pơrăm đĭ boih, hăm đei yang bu mă gơh dŏng pơklaih kon pơlei sư đơ̆ng ti inh?

"Now therefore, do not let Hezekiah deceive you or persuade you like this, and do not believe him; for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people from my hand or the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you from my hand?’ ”","Thoi ei na, dang ei lê̆ pă ăn kơ Hesekia pơhlŭ lu iĕm, pơthơr chông lu iĕm, lu iĕm 'nĕ pă lui kơ sư, yua kơ ưh kơ đei yang char kiơ mă dêh ayơ gơh pơklaih kon pơlei sư đơ̆ng ti inh, dah đơ̆ng ti lu 'bok inh sơ̆; tơma kiơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu iĕm khan gơh dŏng pơklaih lu iĕm đơ̆ng ti inh!’ ”"
"Furthermore, his servants spoke against the LORD God and against His servant Hezekiah.","Lu Yŏng linh Senacherip kang pơma kơnê̆ kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei păng Hesekia đĭch đam sư."
"He also wrote letters to revile the LORD God of Israel, and to speak against Him, saying, “As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people from my hand, so the God of Hezekiah will not deliver His people from my hand.”","Pơtao kư̆m chih hla bơar pơjăm Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael păng khan: “Lu yang lăm dêh char nai ưh kơ kĕ dŏng pơklaih kon pơlei char lu sư đơ̆ng ti inh kư̆m lei-lăi mơ̆n Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Hesekia kư̆m ưh kơ kĕ pơklaih kon pơlei sư đơ̆ng ti inh!”"
"Then they called out with a loud voice in Hebrew to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten them and trouble them, that they might take the city.","Lu sư ôr tơkĕch re hăm nơ̆r Hêbrơ khan kơ lu kon pơlei Jêrusalem oei tơ kơpal dur pơlei kơtơ̆ng, wă kơ lu sư hli tơrơ na blah iŏk pơlei."
"And they spoke against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth—the work of men’s hands.","Lu sư khan kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei pơlei Jêrusalem thoi lu yang kon pơlei đơ̆ng ti kon bơngai pơm."
"Now because of this King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz, prayed and cried out to heaven.","Pơtao Hesekia păng Êsai 'bok khan lê̆ adrol kon drŏ-nglo Amôt, krao khan kơ tơdrong 'nâu, krao khan ôr tŏk truh tơ plĕnh."
"Then the LORD sent an angel who cut down every mighty man of valor, leader, and captain in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned shamefaced to his own land. And when he had gone into the temple of his god, some of his own offspring struck him down with the sword there.","Kră Yang ăn minh 'nu linh jang 'lơ̆ng năm pơlôch pơrăm lê̆ lu linh pran kơtang lu yŏng pơgơ̆r lu linh lăm kơđông pơtao Asiri.

"Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all others, and guided them on every side.","Thoi noh Kră Yang pơklaih Hesekia păng kon pơlei lăm Jêrusalem đơ̆ng ti Senacherip pơtao Asiri păng đơ̆ng ti lu bơngai ayăt nai, ăn kơ lu sư hiôk-hian đơ̆ng puăn pah."
"And many brought gifts to the LORD at Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah, so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations thereafter.","Đei lơ bơngai năm pơyơ̆r lu tơmam soi kơ Kră Yang păng năm ba pơyơ̆r ăn tơmam gĭt kơ Hesekia pơtao Juđa tơ pơlei Jêrusalem; iŏk đơ̆ng năr noh năm tơ anăp Hesekia đe ư-ang pơyom tơ jơ̆p-jang kơ dêh char."
"In those days Hezekiah was sick and near death, and he prayed to the LORD; and He spoke to him and gave him a sign.","Kơplah noh Hesekia đei tơdrong jĭ wă jê̆ lôch; sư krao khan apinh Kră Yang păng Kră Yang ăn kơ sư hlĭch tơpă."
"But Hezekiah did not repay according to the favor shown him, for his heart was lifted up; therefore wrath was looming over him and over Judah and Jerusalem.","Mă-lei Hesekia ưh kơ đei bơnê kơ Kră Yang mă đei ăn kơ sư boih yua kơ jơhngơ̆m sư pơang dêh; lei na Kră Yang hil mĭl hloi kơ sư hăm kon pơlei Juđa păng kon pơlei Jêrusalem."
"Then Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD did not come upon them in the days of Hezekiah.","Na Hesekia kư̆m wih tơjur akâu sư păng tơbral, kon pơlei Jêrusalem kư̆m lei-lăi, na lăm chăl Hesekia tơdrong Kră Yang hil mĭl ưh kơ đei truh tơ lu sư dơ̆ng."
"Hezekiah had very great riches and honor. And he made himself treasuries for silver, for gold, for precious stones, for spices, for shields, and for all kinds of desirable items","Hesekia mơdrŏng mơng păng đei đe pơyom tơpă, sư đei man hnam mong hu, maih, tơmo gĭt, tơmam 'bâu phu, đei khêl păng lu đao hơlă tơmam tơblah 'lơ̆ng 'lơ̆ng."
"storehouses for the harvest of grain, wine, and oil; and stalls for all kinds of livestock, and folds for flocks.","Sư kư̆m pơm pơk tah phe 'ba, sik plei hơmu, đak rơmă ôliwơ păng pơm hơdrong chĭt lu sem dơrong, khŭl triu bơbe păng rơmo."
"Moreover he provided cities for himself, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given him very much property.","Sư kư̆m pơm lu pơlei tih kư̆m đei lơ lu rơmo, triu, bơbe, yua kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ăn kơ sư lơ mŭk tơmam."
"This same Hezekiah also stopped the water outlet of Upper Gihon, and brought the water by tunnel to the west side of the City of David. Hezekiah prospered in all his works.","Hesekia 'nâu mơ̆n đei bơ̆ chĭt tu đak Gihôn na pơchoh lê̆ sư ro tơ gah bơmơ̆t cheng kơ Pơlei Đawit. Hesekia gơh đei jing ngăl lăm rim tơdrong jang sư."
"However, regarding the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, whom they sent to him to inquire about the wonder that was done in the land, God withdrew from him, in order to test him, that He might know all that was in his heart.","Kŭm thoi noh đei bơngai mă đơ̆ng pơtao Babilôn wơh athei năm apinh kơ tơdrong hlĭch mă đei truh tơ lăm char sư, kơplah Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei oei achăng wă pơlong lăng sư wă kơ băt dôm tơdrong lăm jơhngơ̆m sư."
"Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, indeed they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.","Dôm lu tơdrong jang nai Hesekia păng dôm lu tơdrong 'lơ̆ng sư pơm đei chih răk đĭ lăm sơ̆p hla bơar tơdrong tơ'bôh Êsai 'bok khan lê̆ adrol, kon drŏ-nglo Amôt păng kư̆m chih răk lăm Sơ̆p hla bơar lu pơtao Juđa păng pơtao Isơrael."
"So Hezekiah rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the upper tombs of the sons of David; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honored him at his death. Then Manasseh his son reigned in his place.","Hesekia lôch pơdơh hơdai hăm lu 'bok sư, đe 'bŭ sư tơ lăm bơsat kơpal groi lu kon sâu Đawit, đĭ-đăng bơngai Juđa păng kon pơlei Jêrusalem grong ư-ang kơ sư tih tơpă kơplah sư lôch Manase kon drŏ-nglo sư pơgơ̆r pơtrơp sư."
"Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem.","Manase 'nao mơjĭt-'bar sơnăm kơplah sư pơm pơtao păng sư đei pơgơ̆r pơđăm-jĭt pơđăm sơnăm tơ pơlei Jêrusalem."
"But he did evil in the sight of the LORD, according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.","Sư pơm tơdrong kơnê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang kiơ̆ lu tơdrong kơnê̆ krưp dêh lu kon pơlei pơla mă Kră Yang puh tơweh boih đơ̆ng anăp lu bơngai Isơrael."
"For he rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; he raised up altars for the Baals, and made wooden images; and he worshiped all the host of heaven and served them.","Sư man pơdơ̆ng ming dơ̆ng lu anih kơjung mă 'bă sư Hesekia đei pơrăm lê̆, pơm tơiung chơnang soi ăn kơ yang Baal păng man rup yang Asêra, kơkuh kơ đĭ-đăng lu khei sơnglŏng tơ plĕnh, drap păng kơkuh kơ lu tơmam noh."
"He also built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD had said, “In Jerusalem shall My name be forever.”","Sư man lu chơnang soi tơ lăm hnam Kră Yang, tơ anih mă Kră Yang đei khan: “Anăn inh gô oei lăm pơlei Jêrusalem ling-lang.”"
"And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.","Sư kư̆m pơm chơnang soi ăn kơ lu khei sơnglŏng tơ plĕnh 'bơ̆t 'bar pah cham hnam Kră Yang."
"Also he caused his sons to pass through the fire in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom; he practiced soothsaying, used witchcraft and sorcery, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke Him to anger.","Sư 'buh pơyơ̆r kon drŏ-nglo sư pơm tơmam soi tơ lăm Thŭng Ben Hinôm sư chă tơdrong apo, lăng ti wă kơ băt adrol, chă lu pơjâu tơwir, kiơ̆ lu bơngai krao pơma dơnuh hăm atâu.

"He even set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, “In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put My name forever","Sư tah rup yang đe traih lăm hnam Kră Yang tơ anih mă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei đei khan hăm Đawit păng Sôlômôn kon drŏ-nglo sư khan: “Lăm hnam 'nâu păng pơlei Jêrusalem pơlei, mă inh đei rơih iŏk boih đơ̆ng lăm adrĕch bơngai Isơrael, wă 'măn anăn Inh lăm âu ling-lang"
"and I will not again remove the foot of Israel from the land which I have appointed for your fathers—only if they are careful to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.”","Tơdah Isơrael rok kiơ̆ khôi juăt, nơ̆r tơtă pơkă athei mă Inh yua boih Môis bơtho khan kơ lu sư, lei Inh huay kơ toh lê̆ jơ̆ng lu sư đơ̆ng lăm teh đak mă Inh đei ăn boih kơ lu 'bok lu sư.”"
"So Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to do more evil than the nations whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel.","Mă-lei Manase pơhlŭ bơngai Juđa păng kon pơlei Jêrusalem dĭng mah lu sư pơm yoch kơnê̆ hloh kơ lu bơngai adrĕch mă Kră Yang pơrăm pơlôch đĭ 'bơ̆t anăp lu bơngai Isơrael."
"And the LORD spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they would not listen.","Kră Yang bơtho khan kơ Manase păng kon pơlei sư; mă-lei lu sư ưh kơ wă mơ̆ng."
"Therefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the army of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh with hooks, bound him with bronze fetters, and carried him off to Babylon.","Na Kră Yang ăn kơ lu yŏng linh, pơtao Asiri năm wang rôp Manase, chô̆ sư hăm tơlei glang păng tôt muh sư, na chông ba tơ dêh char Babilôn."
"Now when he was in affliction, he implored the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers","Kơplah sư đei tơdrong gleh truh pơmat-tat, na sư krao apinh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei sư păng tơjur akâu tơbral tơpă 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu 'bok sư."
"and prayed to Him; and He received his entreaty, heard his supplication, and brought him back to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD was God.","Manase krao apinh Kră Yang, Sư tơl tơwih nơ̆r Manase apinh păng mơ̆ng nơ̆r sư krao na chông tơbrŏk tơ Jêrusalem pơdrâu ăn dêh char sư kơdih; kơplah noh hloi Manase băt kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei sư."
"After this he built a wall outside the City of David on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, as far as the entrance of the Fish Gate; and it enclosed Ophel, and he raised it to a very great height. Then he put military captains in all the fortified cities of Judah.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ lu tơdrong noh, sư man tơiung ming dur đaih Pơlei Đawit, gah bơmơ̆t kơ tu đak Gihôn lăm Thŭng truh tơ 'Măng Jang Ka, dăr kơ Ôphel, sư man dur kơjung hloh, ăn kơ lu yŏng linh wei tơ lăm rim pơlei kơjăp lăm char Juđa."
"He took away the foreign gods and the idol from the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD and in Jerusalem; and he cast them out of the city.","Sư hŭt lê̆ đĭ lu rup yang đơ̆ng lăm hnam Kră Yang dôm lu rup yang bơngai tơmoi păng chơnang soi mă đêl sư đei man tơ groi hnam Kră Yang tơ pơlei Jêrusalem, sư klơ̆m hŭt đĭ tơ 'nguaih pơlei."
"He also repaired the altar of the LORD, sacrificed peace offerings and thank offerings on it, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel.","Na sư hơmet pơm ming chơnang soi kơ Kră Yang, pơyơ̆r tơmam soi kơ tơdrong rơnŭk rơnua păng tơmam soi 'blŏk bơnê tơ noh; sư bơtho athei lu kon pơlei Juđa lui gơnang kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael."
"Nevertheless the people still sacrificed on the high places, but only to the LORD their God.","Kon pơlei kư̆m oei pơyơ̆r tơmam soi tơ anih kơjung noh, mă-lei pơyơ̆r tơmam soi ăn kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei lu sư đĕch."
"Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, indeed they are written in the book of the kings of Israel.","Dôm lu tơdrong jang nai Manase, nơ̆r sư krao apinh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei, lu nơ̆r 'bok khan lê̆ adrol hăm anăn Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael khan kơ pơtao chih răk lê̆ lăm sơ̆p hla bơar lu pơtao Isơrael."
"Also his prayer and how God received his entreaty, and all his sin and trespass, and the sites where he built high places and set up wooden images and carved images, before he was humbled, indeed they are written among the sayings of Hozai.","Nơ̆r sư krao apinh Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei đei tơl tơwih ăn kơ sư thoi yơ, dôm lu tơdrong yoch kơnê̆ mă sư đei pơm, lu anih kơjung mă sư đei pơm, man rup yang Asêria păng traih rup yang adrol kơ sư tam mă tơbral tơjur akâu sư, âu đei chih răk đĭ tơ lăm sơ̆p hla bơar Hôsai."
"So Manasseh rested with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house. Then his son Amon reigned in his place.","Manase lôch, pơdơh oei hơdai hăm lu 'bok sư, 'bŭ sư lăm anih pơtao sư; Ammôn kon drŏ-nglo sư, pơm pơtao pơtrơp sư."
"Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.","Ammôn sư 'nao lăp 'bar-jĭt 'bar sơnăm kơplah sư pơm pơtao; sư pơgơ̆r 'bar sơnăm lăm pơlei Jêrusalem."
"But he did evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father Manasseh had done; for Amon sacrificed to all the carved images which his father Manasseh had made, and served them.","Sư pơm tơdrong kơnê̆ tơpă 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang nhen thoi Manase, 'bă sư đei pơm boih, kơkuh pơyơ̆r kơ lu rup yang đe man dah traih mă 'bă sư Manase đei pơm păng kơkuh kơ lu yang rup noh."
"And he did not humble himself before the LORD, as his father Manasseh had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.","Mă-lei sư ưh kơ đei tơbral tơjur akâu kơdih 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang thoi Manase, 'bă sư, rai pơm kơnê̆ hloh."
"Then his servants conspired against him, and killed him in his own house.","Lu yŏng jang kơ sư chă đon wă pơm kơ sư, na pơlôch hloi sư kơtă lăm hnam pơtao."
"But the people of the land executed all those who had conspired against King Amon. Then the people of the land made his son Josiah king in his place.","Na lu kon pơlei kư̆m rôp pơlôch hloi lu bơngai pơlôch pơtao Ammôn; na pôk hloi Jôsia, kon drŏ-nglo sư pơm pơtao pơtrơp sư."
"Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem.","Jôsia 'nao lăp tơhngam sơnăm 'bơ̆t kơplah đe pôk sư pơm pơtao păng sư pơgơ̆r đei pêng-jĭt mônh sơnăm lăm pơlei Jêrusalem."
"And he did what was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the ways of his father David; he did not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.","Sư pơm 'lơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, kiơ̆ trong Đawit, 'bok sư, ưh kơ weh gah 'ngiĕo dah gah 'ma."
"For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was still young, he began to seek the God of his father David; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, the wooden images, the carved images, and the molded images.","Sơnăm mă tơhngam lăm chăl sư pơgơ̆r, mă sư oei 'lơ̆p mơlôh, sư pơtơm chơchă Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Đawit, 'bok sư Sơnăm mă mơjĭt-'bar, sư pơtơm hơmet rơgoh lăm char Juđa păng pơlei Jêrusalem, hŭt lê̆ lu anih kơjung, gơ̆ng kơkuh kơ rup yang Asêria, rup yang đe traih păng rup đe hling tuh."
"They broke down the altars of the Baals in his presence, and the incense altars which were above them he cut down; and the wooden images, the carved images, and the molded images he broke in pieces, and made dust of them and scattered it on the graves of those who had sacrificed to them.","Đe teh pơchah lê̆ đĭ lu chơnang soi kơ lu rup yang Baal 'bơ̆t anăp sư, teh pơchah pơhĕch lu chơnang soh 'long 'bâu phu kơpal chơnang soi noh; lu rup yang Asêria, rup yang đe traih păng rup yang đe hling tuh, teh tơgơ̆ tơpơ̆k lê̆, teh pơhĕch, na iŏk prôi tơ kơpal bơsat lu bơngai lôch mă đêl soi sơn ah kơ sư păng pơm rup yang noh."
"He also burned the bones of the priests on their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.","Sư kư̆m iŏk kơting lu 'bok soi na soh rŭk tơ kơpal lu chơnang mă lu sư juăt kơ soi kơ lu yang noh, na hơmet rơgoh char Juđa păng Jêrusalem."
"And so he did in the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, as far as Naphtali and all around, with axes.","Lăm pơlei adrĕch Manase, Êphraim păng pơlei Simêôn, truh tơ lu pơlei adrĕch Naptali, anih mă đĭ juơ tăp dăr."
"When he had broken down the altars and the wooden images, had beaten the carved images into powder, and cut down all the incense altars throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.","Sư teh pơrăm lê̆ lu chơnang soi lu gơ̆ng rup yang Asêria, teh pơchah lê̆ lu gơ̆ng đe pơm yang jơ̆p kơ tơring char Isơrael, na sư wih brŏk tơ pơlei Jêrusalem."
"In the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the temple, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.","Lăm sơnăm mă mơjĭt-tơhngam chăl sư pơgơ̆r, đang kơ sư hơmet tơring char păng hnam akŭm rơgoh boih, na sư wơh Saphan kon drŏ-nglo Asalia, Maaseia bơngai pơgơ̆r pơlei tih păng Jôa kon drŏ-nglo Jêhôahas bơngai chih răk dôm tơdrong truh, wă pơm pơdơ̆ng ming Hnam Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei sư."
"When they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites who kept the doors had gathered from the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, from all the remnant of Israel, from all Judah and Benjamin, and which they had brought back to Jerusalem.","Lu đe noh năm tơ Hilkia 'bok soi tơm, jao ăn kơ sư jên đe pơyơ̆r kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei, wă khan lu jên kăk bơngai Lêwi lu bơngai wei 'măng jang mă đei iŏk bơih đơ̆ng ti lu bơngai Manase, bơngai Êphraim păng lu bơngai mă oei arih lăm lu bơngai Isơrael, kư̆m iŏk đơ̆ng lu bơngai Juđa, Bênjamin păng đơ̆ng lu kon pơlei oei lăm pơlei Jêrusalem."
"Then they put it in the hand of the foremen who had the oversight of the house of the LORD; and they gave it to the workmen who worked in the house of the LORD, to repair and restore the house.","Lu sư jao jên noh kơ lu bơngai wei-lăng tơdrong jang lăm Hnam Kră Yang; lu sư apah thơ̆ wă pơm hơmet ming hnam akŭm Kră Yang."
"They gave it to the craftsmen and builders to buy hewn stone and timber for beams, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.","Sư kư̆m jao kơthơ jang 'long, thơ̆ man wă apah răt tơmo tơpei, lu 'long pơm tơpang tơpơng, jrăng hnam mă đêl lu pơtao Juđa lê̆ hiah răm."
"And the men did the work faithfully. Their overseers were Jahath and Obadiah the Levites, of the sons of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to supervise. Others of the Levites, all of whom were skillful with instruments of music","Lu bơngai thơ̆ noh jang đĭ jơhngơ̆m.

"were over the burden bearers and were overseers of all who did work in any kind of service. And some of the Levites were scribes, officers, and gatekeepers.","Lu bơngai 'nâu wei-lăng lu bơngai jang păng wei-lăng tôm tơdrong jang; lu mơ'nah bơngai Lêwi chih hla bơar, lu kai păng lu bơngai gak 'măng."
"Now when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law of the LORD given by Moses.","Kơplah lu sư ba jên đơ̆ng đe pơyơ̆r kơ hnam Kră Yang bơih, na Hilkia 'bok soi tơm sư 'bôh sơ̆p hla bơar khôi juăt Kră Yang ăn kơ Môis."
"Then Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the LORD.” And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan.","Hilkia khan kơ Saphan bơngai chih hla bơar: “Inh đei 'bôh hla bơar khôi juăt lăm Hnam Kră Yang.” Hilkia ăn Sơ̆p hla bơar khôi juăt noh kơ Saphan."
"So Shaphan carried the book to the king, bringing the king word, saying, “All that was committed to your servants they are doing.","Saphan chĕp ba sơ̆p hla bơar khôi juăt ăn kơ pơtao, na khan kơ pơtao: “Dôm tơdrong jang mă ih đei pơjao ăn kơ lu yŏng pơgơ̆r dang ei lu sư oei jang."
"And they have gathered the money that was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers and the workmen.”","Lu sư iŏk ba bơih lu jên mă đơ̆ng lăm hnam Kră Yang păng kư̆m đei jao ăn bơih kơ bơngai wei-lăng jang păng lu bơngai jang."
"Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read it before the king.","Saphan bơngai chih hla bơar khan dơ̆ng kơ pơtao: “Hilkia 'bok soi tơm đei jao kơ inh sơ̆p hla bơar khôi juăt.” Saphan đŏk hloi 'bơ̆t anăp pơtao."
"Thus it happened, when the king heard the words of the Law, that he tore his clothes.","Wă pơtao kơtơ̆ng nơ̆r đơ̆ng lăm sơ̆p hla bơar khôi juăt noh Sư hek hloi ao sư."
"Then the king commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Abdon the son of Micah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king, saying","Pơtao athei Hilkia, Ahikam kon drŏ-nglo Saphan, Apđôn kon drŏ-nglo Mika. Saphan bơngai chih hla bơar păng Asaia bơngai kơiĕng pơtao khan"
"“Go, inquire of the LORD for me, and for those who are left in Israel and Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found; for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out on us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do according to all that is written in this book.”","“Năm krao apinh bĕ Kră Yang kơ inh kơ lu bơngai Isơrael oei arih hlot păng lu bơngai Juđa gah dôm nơ̆r mă đei chih lăm sơ̆p hla bơar mă 'nao 'bôh âu khan; kơ tơdrong Kră Yang hil mĭl mă truh tơ lu bơ̆n tih tơpă, yua kơ lu 'bok bơ̆n sơ̆ ưh kơ wă mơ̆ng păng ưh kơ chu kiơ̆ nơ̆r Kră Yang, kư̆m kuă kơ pơm kiơ̆ nơ̆r mă đei chih lăm sơ̆p hla bơar âu.”"
"So Hilkiah and those the king had appointed went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe. (She dwelt in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter.) And they spoke to her to that effect.","Hilkia păng lu bơngai mă pơtao đei wơh năm tơ'bơ̆p Hulda yă khan lê̆ adrol, akăn Sallum bơngai wei-lăng ao giĕng, Sư kon drŏ-nglo Tôkhat, Sâu Hasra; yă Hulda sư oei lăm Tơring mă 'bar lăm pơlei tih Jêrusalem; lu sư khan kơ yă ei kiơ̆ thoi nơ̆r pơtao đei tơtă."
"Then she answered them, “Thus says the LORD God of Israel, ‘Tell the man who sent you to Me","Yă ei khan kơ lu sư: “Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael khan: ‘Roi bĕ kơ bơngai mă wơh ih năm tơ inh"
"“Thus says the LORD: ‘Behold, I will bring calamity on this place and on its inhabitants, all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah","Kră Yang khan: Inh wă ăn tơdrong răm truh tơ anih 'nâu păng tơ lu kon pơlei mă oei lăm anih âu, đĭ-đăng nơ̆r hiap pơtê̆ mă đei chih boih lăm sơ̆p hla bơar mă đei đŏk boih 'bơ̆t anăp pơtao Juđa."
"because they have forsaken Me and burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands. Therefore My wrath will be poured out on this place, and not be quenched.’ ” ’","Yua kơ lu sư achăng lê̆ Inh boih, soh 'long 'bâu phu kơ yang nai, yua dôm tơdrong đơ̆ng ti lu sư pơm na tơblĕk Inh; lei na Inh gô tuh tơdrong Inh hil mĭl tơ anih 'nâu, ưh kơ đei layơ ngach.’"
"But as for the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, in this manner you shall speak to him, ‘Thus says the LORD God of Israel: “Concerning the words which you have heard","Roi bĕ kơ pơtao Juđa mă wơh ih năm krao apinh Kră Yang, dôm nơ̆r ih đei kơtơ̆ng 'nâu, Kră Yang Isơrael khan thoi noh."
"because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before God when you heard His words against this place and against its inhabitants, and you humbled yourself before Me, and you tore your clothes and wept before Me, I also have heard you,” says the LORD.","‘Yua kơ ih đei jơhngơ̆m rơmuăn tơjur akâu kơdih 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei wă ih kơtơ̆ng nơ̆r Sư khan wă hil phak anih 'nâu păng kơ kon pơlei oei lăm âu, ih tơjur boih akâu 'bơ̆t anăp Inh, hek ao păng nhơ̆m hmoi 'bơ̆t anăp Inh, Inh kư̆m kơtơ̆ng boih nơ̆r ih,’ Kră Yang khan."
"“Surely I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace; and your eyes shall not see all the calamity which I will bring on this place and its inhabitants.” ’ ” So they brought back word to the king.","‘Âu Inh gô ăn kơ ih wih oei hơdai hăm lu 'bok ih, đe gô 'bŭ ih hiôk-hian păng măt ih pă đei 'bôh boih dôm tơdrong gleh truh mă Inh wă pơm kơ anih 'nâu hăm kon pơlei oei lăm âu.’ ” Lu đe noh năm roi ăn kơ pơtao nơ̆r noh."
"Then the king sent and gathered all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.","Pơtao athei akŭm pơđĭ lu kră lăm Juđa păng pơlei Jêrusalem."
"The king went up to the house of the LORD, with all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem—the priests and the Levites, and all the people, great and small. And he read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant which had been found in the house of the LORD.","Pơtao tŏk năm tơ Hnam Kră Yang hơdai hăm đĭ-đăng lu drŏ-nglo bơngai Juđa, lu bơngai đơ̆ng lăm pơlei Jêrusalem, lu 'bok soi lu bơngai Lêwi, đĭ-đăng kon pơlei 'lơ̆p 'lŏ năm kiơ̆, Pơtao đŏk ăn kơ lu sư mơ̆ng nơ̆r đơ̆ng sơ̆p hla bơar tơdrong pơgơ̆p đei 'bôh đơ̆ng lăm Hnam Kră Yang."
"Then the king stood in his place and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, and to keep His commandments and His testimonies and His statutes with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book.","Pơtao dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anih sư, pơm tơdrong pơgơ̆p dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang, pơkă pơkăm kiơ̆ Kră Yang đĭ jơhngơ̆m klơm klak wei răk nơ̆r tơtă, tơdrong pơkă khan păng khôi juăt, wă pơm kiơ̆ trŏ thoi nơ̆r pơgơ̆p mă đei chih lăm sơ̆p hla bơar âu."
"And he made all who were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin take a stand.

"Thus Josiah removed all the abominations from all the country that belonged to the children of Israel, and made all who were present in Israel diligently serve the LORD their God. All his days they did not depart from following the LORD God of their fathers.","Jôsia iŏk hŭt lê̆ đĭ dôm rup yang kơnê̆ 'mê̆ Krưp đơ̆ng lăm tơring char Isơrael păng athei đĭ-đăng kon pơlei oei lăm tơring char Isơrael kơkuh gơnang kơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei.

"Now Josiah kept a Passover to the LORD in Jerusalem, and they slaughtered the Passover lambs on the fourteenth day of the first month.","Jôsia pơm giĕng Năm Brih 'blŏk hơdơ̆r kơ Kră Yang tơ pơlei Jêrusalem; năr mơjĭt-puăn khei mônh lu sư 'bet pơlôch, triu pơm giĕng Năm Brih"
"And he set the priests in their duties and encouraged them for the service of the house of the LORD.","pơtao sư jao ăn tơdrong jang kơ rim 'nu 'bok soi, pơlung lu sư kơ tơdrong jang lăm Hnam Kră Yang."
"Then he said to the Levites who taught all Israel, who were holy to the LORD: “Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, built. It shall no longer be a burden on your shoulders. Now serve the LORD your God and His people Israel.","Sư khan kơ lu bơngai Lêwi, bơngai mă bơtho kơ đĭ-đăng kon pơlei Isơrael, bơngai Lêwi mă đe 'măn rơgoh 'lơ̆ng ăn kơ Kră Yang: Năm tah bĕ Hom 'Lơ̆ng Rơgoh tơ lăm hnam Kră Yang mă Sôlômôn kon drŏ-nglo Đawit, pơtao Isơrael đei pơm; lu iĕm huay pă tung hom noh kơpal hơngiĕng dơ̆ng.

"Prepare yourselves according to your fathers’ houses, according to your divisions, following the written instruction of David king of Israel and the written instruction of Solomon his son.","Hơmet bĕ lu iĕm kơdih kiơ̆ kơ adrĕch 'bok lu iĕm, kiơ̆ kơ khŭl lu iĕm, kiơ̆ mă Đawit pơtao Isơrael păng Sôlômôn kon drŏ-nglo sư đei chih tơtă boih."
"And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers’ houses of your brethren the lay people, and according to the division of the father’s house of the Levites.","Oei dơ̆ng bĕ lăm anih rơgoh, hơdai hăm lu bơngai Lêwi săp pơrĕng kiơ̆ kơ khŭl hnam dơnŏ bơngai Isơrael"
"So slaughter the Passover offerings, consecrate yourselves, and prepare them for your brethren, that they may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.”","'Bet triu pơm tơmam soi Năm Brih athei hơmet akâu iĕm rơgoh, hơmet 'nhĕm triu ăn kơ lu 'nhŏng oh iĕm wă pơm kiơ̆ trŏ thoi nơ̆r Kră Yang đei yua Môis khan tơbăt."
"Then Josiah gave the lay people lambs and young goats from the flock, all for Passover offerings for all who were present, to the number of thirty thousand, as well as three thousand cattle; these were from the king’s possessions.","Jôsia iŏk Sem dơrong sư kơdih asong ăn kơ lu kon pơlei, pêng-jĭt rơbâu tŏ triu păng bơbe, pơm tơmam soi Năm brih, kư̆m ăn pêng-rơbâu tŏ rơmo tơno, wă ăn kơ lu bơngai mă đei năm akŭm pơm giĕng Năm Brih noh."
"And his leaders gave willingly to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave to the priests for the Passover offerings two thousand six hundred from the flock, and three hundred cattle.","Lu yŏng pơgơ̆r kư̆m đei jơhngơ̆m wă asong kon sem pơm tơmam soi pơyơ̆r ăn kơ kon pơlei, ăn kơ lu 'bok soi păng lu bơngai Lêwi.

"Also Conaniah, his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave to the Levites for Passover offerings five thousand from the flock and five hundred cattle.","Kônania, Semaia, Nêthanel, 'nhŏng oh sư, Hasabia, Jêiêl păng Jôsabat lu kră pơgơ̆r bơngai Lêwi ăn pơđăm-rơbâu tŏ triu bơbe pơm tơmam soi Năm Brih păng pơđăm-hrĕng tŏ rơmo wă ăn kơ bơngai sa lăm năr giĕng Năm Brih."
"So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their places, and the Levites in their divisions, according to the king’s command.","Tơdrong jang hơmet lê̆ đang boih, lu 'bok soi lu sư dơ̆ng 'bơ̆t anih lu sư kơdih păng lu bơngai Lêwi kiơ̆ kơ khŭl lu sư thoi nơ̆r pơtao tơtă."
"And they slaughtered the Passover offerings; and the priests sprinkled the blood with their hands, while the Levites skinned the animals.","Lu sư 'bet pơlôch triu pơm tơmam soi pơyơ̆r giĕng Năm Brih, na lu 'bok soi iŏk pham đơ̆ng ti lu sư na tơtreh; lu bơngai Lêwi nai lŏng akar lu kon sem tơmam soi noh."
"Then they removed the burnt offerings that they might give them to the divisions of the fathers’ houses of the lay people, to offer to the LORD, as it is written in the Book of Moses. And so they did with the cattle.","Lu sư 'măn lê̆ lu tơmam soi 'buh phara, wă klah asong ăn kơ kon pơlei, kiơ̆ kơ khŭl adrĕch, 'bă lu sư wă soi pơyơ̆r ăn kơ Kră Yang kiơ̆ thoi đei chih boih lăm sơ̆p hla bơar Môis: Lu sư kư̆m yua lu rơmo pơm 'nhĕm sa lei-lăi mơ̆n."
"Also they roasted the Passover offerings with fire according to the ordinance; but the other holy offerings they boiled in pots, in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them quickly among all the lay people.","Kiơ̆ kơ tơdrong juăt, lu sư phang lu 'nhĕm kon triu kơ giĕng Năm Brih thoi đei tơtă; bĕ lu 'nhĕm 'lơ̆ng rơgoh đe pai lăm gŏ 'bŭng păng lăm gŏ glah, na lu sư asong ăn hloi kơ đĭ-đăng bơngai."
"Then afterward they prepared portions for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the sons of Aaron, were busy in offering burnt offerings and fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared portions for themselves and for the priests, the sons of Aaron.","Đơ̆ng noh, lu sư hơmet 'nhĕm sĕch kơ lu sư kơdih păng kơ lu 'bok soi, yua kơ lu 'bok soi noh, lu sư kon sâu Arôn oei hiơ̆k kơ pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'buh pơkhôi păng rơmă dĭng truh kơmăng. Thoi ei na lu bơngai Lêwi athei hơmet tơmam sa kơ lu sư kơdih păng lu 'bok soi lu kon sâu Arôn."
"And the singers, the sons of Asaph, were in their places, according to the command of David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s seer. Also the gatekeepers were at each gate; they did not have to leave their position, because their brethren the Levites prepared portions for them.","Lu bơngai hơri, kon sâu Asap; Hêman păng Jêđuthun, 'bok 'bôh lê̆ adrol pơtao, kư̆m oei dơ̆ng lăm anih lu sư kơdih, kiơ̆ thoi tơdrong juăt Đawit tơtă; lu bơngai gak wei 'măng jang kư̆m ngôi tơ rim 'măng, ưh kơ weh đơ̆ng tơdrong jang sư kơdih, yua kơ 'nhŏng oh lu sư bơngai Lêwi đei hơmet ăn boih tơmam sa kơ lu sư."
"So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the Passover and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD, according to the command of King Josiah.","Na lăm năr noh tơdrong akŭm kơkuh kơ Kră Yang đei hơmet 'lơ̆ng boih wă pơm giĕng 'blŏk hơdơ̆r kơ năr Năm Brih, wă pơyơ̆r tơmam soi 'buh pơkhôi tơ kơpal chơnang soi Kră Yang kiơ̆ thoi nơ̆r pơtao Jôsia đei tơtă."
"And the children of Israel who were present kept the Passover at that time, and the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days.","Đĭ lu kon pơlei Isơrael đei tơ noh, pơm giĕng Năm Brih minh năr păng pơm giĕng sa 'Bĕng ưh kơ đei 'Buih Pông lăm tơpơh năr."
"There had been no Passover kept in Israel like that since the days of Samuel the prophet; and none of the kings of Israel had kept such a Passover as Josiah kept, with the priests and the Levites, all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.","Đơ̆ng chăl Samuel 'bok khan lê̆ adrol, lăm bơngai Isơrael đe ưh tam đei pơm giĕng Năm Brih tih thoi noh; păng kư̆m ưh kơ đei pơtao ayơ lăm Isơrael mă pơm 'blŏk hơdơ̆r năr giĕng Năm Brih thoi pơtao Jôsia, hăm lu 'bok soi bơngai Lêwi, đĭ kon pơlei Juđa păng Isơrael mă đei tơ noh păng kon pơlei đơ̆ng Jêrusalem đei pơm noh."
"In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah this Passover was kept.","Đe pơm giĕng Năm Brih lăm sơnăm mơjĭt-tơhngam chăl pơtao Jôsia pơgơ̆r."
"After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates; and Josiah went out against him.","Đơ̆ng rŏng đĭ kơ tơdrong 'lơ̆ng noh, đang kơ Jôsia hơmet Hnam Kră Yang boih, na Nêkô pơtao đe Êyiptơ tŏk blah tơ pơlei Karchêmis cheng đak Krong Ơphrat; Jôsia năm găn blah lu sư."
"But he sent messengers to him, saying, “What have I to do with you, king of Judah? I have not come against you this day, but against the house with which I have war; for God commanded me to make haste. Refrain from meddling with God, who is with me, lest He destroy you.”","Nêkô wơh bơngai năm khan kơ Jôsia: “Ơ pơtao đe Juđa, inh hăm ih hăm đei tơdrong kiơ?

"Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself so that he might fight with him, and did not heed the words of Necho from the mouth of God. So he came to fight in the Valley of Megiddo.","Mă-lei, Jôsia ưh kơ kơdŭn tơ rŏng, ưh kơ wă mơ̆ng nơ̆r Kră Yang đei yua Nêkô roi tơbăt; sư rai hơmet hrŭk hơbĕn ao tơwơ̆l năm tơ anăp tơblah hăm Nêkô; lu sư tơblah băl tơ lăm Thŭng Mêgiđô."
"And the archers shot King Josiah; and the king said to his servants, “Take me away, for I am severely wounded.”","Lu linh chĕp hră prah 'bơm hloi pơtao Jôsia, Jôsia khan kơ yŏng linh wei sư: “Tung ba inh weh đơ̆ng âu bĕ, yua kơ inh 'bơm 'brơ̆m hră boih rơka jrŭ dêh.”"
"His servants therefore took him out of that chariot and put him in the second chariot that he had, and they brought him to Jerusalem. So he died, and was buried in one of the tombs of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.","Lu yŏng linh sư pôk iŏk sư đơ̆ng gre aseh sư, ba sư hăm gre aseh nai, na chơ ba sư brŏk tơ pơlei Jêrusalem. Sư lôch, đe 'bŭ sư hơdai hăm bơsat lu 'bok sư. Đĭ bơngai Juđa păng bơngai lăm pơlei Jêrusalem grong nhơ̆m hmoi kơ sư."
"Jeremiah also lamented for Josiah. And to this day all the singing men and the singing women speak of Josiah in their lamentations. They made it a custom in Israel; and indeed they are written in the Laments.","Jêrêmi pơm 'bai hơri nhơ̆m hmoi kơ Jôsia; kư̆m đei lu bơngai drŏ-nglo, drŏ-kăn oei hơri pôk kơ pơtao Jôsia dĭng truh dang ei; tơdrong hơri nhơ̆m hmoi jing juăt tơ lăm lu bơngai Isơrael; 'nâu tơdrong hơri noh đe chih răk tơ lăm sơ̆p hla bơar nhơ̆m hmoi."
"Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and his goodness, according to what was written in the Law of the LORD","Dôm lu tơdrong jang nai Jôsia đei pơm păng dôm lu tơdrong jang 'lơ̆ng mă sư pơm kiơ̆ kơ đei chih lăm sơ̆p hla bơar khôi juăt Kră Yang."
"and his deeds from first to last, indeed they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.","Tơdrong jang sư đơ̆ng blŭng-a truh tơ tôch, đei chih răk boih tơ lăm sơ̆p hla bơar lu pơtao Isơrael păng pơtao Juđa."
"Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father’s place in Jerusalem.","Kon pơlei tơring ei, pôk Jêhôahas, kon drŏ-nglo Jôsia pơm pơtao pơtrơp đơ̆ng 'bă sư tơ pơlei Jêrusalem."
"Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.","Jêhôahas 'nao 'bar-jĭt pêng sơnăm 'bơ̆t năr đe pôk sư pơm pơtao păng sư pơgơ̆r lăp pêng khei tơ pơlei Jêrusalem."
"Now the king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem; and he imposed on the land a tribute of one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.","Pơtao Êyiptơ tơjur lê̆ Jêhôahas đơ̆ng pơm pơtao pơlei Jêrusalem păng phak dêh char Juđa ra pêng tân puăn-hrĕng kĭ jên hu păng pêng-jĭt puăn kĭ maih."
"Then the king of Egypt made Jehoahaz’s brother Eliakim king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother and carried him off to Egypt.","Pơtao Êyiptơ pôk Jêhôahas, oh Êliakim pơm pơtao đe Juđa tơ Jêrusalem păng krao tơplih anăn sư jing Jêhôiakim. Pơtao Nêkô rôp Êliakim 'nhŏng Jêhôahas, chông ba tơ dêh char Êyiptơ."
"Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And he did evil in the sight of the LORD his God.","Jêhôiakim 'nao 'bar-jĭt pơđăm sơnăm kơplah sư pơm pơtao; sư pơgơ̆r mơjĭt-mônh sơnăm tơ pơlei Jêrusalem păng sư pơm tơdrong kơnê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei sư."
"Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against him, and bound him in bronze fetters to carry him off to Babylon.","Nebukatnessar pơtao char Babilôn tŏk blah sư, rôp chô̆ sư hăm glang kong chông ba sư tơ dêh char Babilôn."
"Nebuchadnezzar also carried off some of the articles from the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.","Nebukatnessar kư̆m blah iŏk lu tơmam đơ̆ng lăm Hnam Kră Yang chĕp ba tah tơ lăm hnam pơtao sư tơ Babilôn."
"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, the abominations which he did, and what was found against him, indeed they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. Then Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place.","Lu tơdrong jang nai dơ̆ng Jêhôiakim đei pơm, dôm lu tơdrong kơnê̆ 'mê̆ brư̆ sư pơm, đĭ dôm tơdrong đei chih răk lăm sơ̆p hla bơar pơtao Isơrael păng Juđa. Jêhôiachin kon drŏ-nglo sư pơm pơtao pơtrơp sư."
"Jehoiachin was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months and ten days. And he did evil in the sight of the LORD.","Jêhôiachin 'nao mơjĭt-tơhngam sơnăm kơplah đe pôk sư pơm pơtao, sư pơgơ̆r lăp pêng khei mơjĭt năr tơ pơlei Jêrusalem. Sư pơm tơdrong kơnê̆ 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang."
"At the turn of the year King Nebuchadnezzar summoned him and took him to Babylon, with the costly articles from the house of the LORD, and made Zedekiah, Jehoiakim’s brother, king over Judah and Jerusalem.","Truh lăm bơyan puih, pơtao Nebukatnessar wơh đe năm rôp chông ba sư tơ dêh char Babilôn, kư̆m iŏk dôm tơmam 'lơ̆ng gĭt đơ̆ng lăm Hnam Kră Yang, na pôk Sêdêkia ma sư pơm pơtao pơgơ̆r dêh char Juđa păng pơlei Jêrusalem."
"Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.","Sêdêkia 'nao 'bar-jĭt mônh sơnăm kơplah đe pôk sư pơm pơtao păng sư pơgơ̆r mơjĭt-mônh sơnăm lăm pơlei Jêrusalem."
"He did evil in the sight of the LORD his God, and did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet, who spoke from the mouth of the LORD.","Sư pơm tơdrong kơnê̆ dêh 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei sư, ưh kơ wă tơjur akâu 'bơ̆t anăp Jêrêmi 'bok khan lê̆ adrol nơ̆r đơ̆ng Kră Yang"
"And he also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear an oath by God; but he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning to the LORD God of Israel.","Sư kư̆m iung blah pơtao Nebukatnessar, bơngai mă athei sư pơkă yua anăn Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei. Sư jing kơchu arăng kơ̆l, ưh kơ wă wih tơ Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei Isơrael."
"Moreover all the leaders of the priests and the people transgressed more and more, according to all the abominations of the nations, and defiled the house of the LORD which He had consecrated in Jerusalem.","Hloh kơ noh dơ̆ng, lu đei 'bok soi păng lu kon pơlei rai kiơ̆ lu tơdrong kơnê̆ 'mê̆ brư̆ thoi lu bơngai tơmoi lăm dêh char jum dăr lu sư, pơm pơ'mê̆ kơ hnam Kră Yang mă Sư đei rơih iŏk 'măn lê̆ rơgoh lăm pơlei Jêrusalem."
"And the LORD God of their fathers sent warnings to them by His messengers, rising up early and sending them, because He had compassion on His people and on His dwelling place.","Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei 'bok lu sư đei lơ wơ̆t wơh bơngai pơtruh nơ̆r Sư bơtho khan ling-lang, yua kơ Sư 'mêm mơnat kơ kon pơlei pơla Sư păng hnam Sư oei."
"But they mocked the messengers of God, despised His words, and scoffed at His prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against His people, till there was no remedy.","Mă-lei lu sư hiap lu bơngai đơ̆ng Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei, ưh kơ wă mơ̆ng pơdê nơ̆r Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei, pơjăm lu bơngai khan lê̆ adrol Kră Yang dĭng mah Kră Yang hil mĭl phak kon pơlei Sư, ưh pă gơh hơmet ming liơ."
"Therefore He brought against them the king of the Chaldeans, who killed their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion on young man or virgin, on the aged or the weak; He gave them all into his hand.","Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ăn pơtao bơngai Babilôn, iŏk đao gưm pơlôch lu kon tơdăm lăm anih rơgoh lu sư, ưh pă 'mêm mơnat kơ bu, tơdăm dah adruh 'lơ̆p, kră mă pă kĕ.

"And all the articles from the house of God, great and small, the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king and of his leaders, all these he took to Babylon.","Pơtao iŏk đĭ lu tơmam yua đơ̆ng lăm Hnam Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei, tih dah iĕ lu tơmam gĭt lăm Hnam Kră Yang, lu tơmam gĭt pơtao păng tơmam gĭt lu yŏng pơgơ̆r, iŏk đĭ chĕp ba tơ dêh char Babilôn."
"Then they burned the house of God, broke down the wall of Jerusalem, burned all its palaces with fire, and destroyed all its precious possessions.","Lu linh Babilôn soh hnam Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei, teh pơchah lê̆ dur pơlei Jêrusalem, soh đĭ hnam pơtao păng pơrăm đĭ lu tơmam kăl yua lăm pơlei."
"And those who escaped from the sword he carried away to Babylon, where they became servants to him and his sons until the rule of the kingdom of Persia","Lu bơngai mă oei arih klaih đơ̆ng đao gưm, đe rôp chông ba pơm bơnă tơ char Babilôn; lu sư pơm đĭch đam kơ pơtao hăm kơ lu kon sâu sư dĭng truh tơ chăl pơtao dêh Persia pơgơ̆r"
"to fulfill the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her Sabbaths. As long as she lay desolate she kept Sabbath, to fulfill seventy years.","Tơdrong 'nâu truh wă pơsĭt kơ nơ̆r Kră Yang khan mă đơ̆ng Jêrêmi 'bok khan lê̆ adrol roi tơbăt.

"Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and also put it in writing, saying","Lăm sơnăm blŭng-a chăl Sirus pơm pơtao Persia, Kră Yang wă pơsĭt nơ̆r Sư mă Jêrêmi đei khan adrol boih, Kră Yang pơm ăn kơ jơhngơ̆m Sirus pơtao Persia, wă kơ sư roi tơbăt tơ jơ̆p-jang teh đak sư, hăm chih hla bơar roi tơbăt khan"
"Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: All the kingdoms of the earth the LORD God of heaven has given me. And He has commanded me to build Him a house at Jerusalem which is in Judah.
