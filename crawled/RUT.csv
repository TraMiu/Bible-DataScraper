"Now it came to pass, in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem, Judah, went to dwell in the country of Moab, he and his wife and his two sons.","Lăm chăl lu kră sek tơlang pơgơ̆r đei pơngot rơwĕt tih lăm dêh char Juđê, đei minh 'nu bơngai đơ̆ng pơlei Betlehem dêh Juđê, sư chông ba akăn păng 'bar 'nu kon năm truh tơ dêh Môap na lu sư oei tơ noh."
"The name of the man was Elimelech, the name of his wife was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion—Ephrathites of Bethlehem, Judah. And they went to the country of Moab and remained there.","Bơngai drŏ-nglo anăn Êlimêlek, akăn sư anăn Naômi, 'bar 'nu kon drŏ-nglo anăn Makhlôn păng Kiliôn. Lu sư đơ̆ng bơngai Êphrat, pơlei Betlehem, dêh Juđê. Lu sư năm tơ teh đak Môap păng oei tơ noh."
"Then Elimelech, Naomi’s husband, died; and she was left, and her two sons.","Mă-lei Êlimêlek klo Naômi lôch, achăng akăn sư păng 'bar 'nu kon tơdăm sư."
"Now they took wives of the women of Moab: the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth. And they dwelt there about ten years.","Bre kon sư chă akăn oei kơ adruh Môap; minh 'nu anăn Orpa, minh 'nu noh anăn sư Rut; lu sư oei tơ noh dang mơjĭt sơnăm."
"Then both Mahlon and Chilion also died; so the woman survived her two sons and her husband.","Đơ̆ng rŏng kơ noh Mahlơn păng Kiliôn bre sư kư̆m lôch, achăng lê̆ mĕ sư Naômi pă đei klo pă đei kon."
"Then she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the country of Moab that the LORD had visited His people by giving them bread.","Kơplah noh Naômi kơtơ̆ng khan Kră Yang đei tơgŭm kon pơlei sư, tơmam sa phĭ mah, na sư hăm bre mŏ mai sư iung lĕch đơ̆ng dêh Môap wih brŏk tơ dêh char sư kơdih."
"Therefore she went out from the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.","Thoi noh na sư achăng lê̆ pơlei mă sư oei noh na wih brŏk tơ dêh char Juđê hăm bre mŏ mai sư."
"And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go, return each to her mother’s house. The LORD deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me.","Naômi khan kơ bre mŏ mai sư thoi âu: Năm bĕ măr iĕm wih brŏk tơ hnam mĕ iĕm kơdih. Apinh Kră Yang ăn kơ măr iĕm pŭn hiôk, kư̆m thoi măr iĕm đei pơm 'lơ̆ng kơ inh hăm lu bơngai lôch noh."
"The LORD grant that you may find rest, each in the house of her husband.” So she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices and wept.","Hơpơi kơ Kră Yang ăn kơ măr iĕm tơdrong chơt hiôk hăm klo hle. Đơ̆ng noh sư kuăr chŭm bre mŏ mai sư na bre mŏ mai sư nhơ̆m."
"And they said to her, “Surely we will return with you to your people.”","Bre mŏ mai sư khan: Ưh ôh nhi gô brŏk kiơ̆ tơ dêh char ih."
"But Naomi said, “Turn back, my daughters; why will you go with me? Are there still sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?","Naômi tơl: Ơ mŏ hơdruh, brŏk bĕ tơ hnam mĕ iĕm. Năm kiơ̆ inh wă pơm kiơ? Dơnŏ khan inh oei đei kon dơ̆ng lei na gô pơm klo măr iĕm?"
"Turn back, my daughters, go—for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say I have hope, if I should have a husband tonight and should also bear sons","Ơ bre mŏ adruh măr iĕm brŏk bĕ, wih bĕ, yua kơ inh đĭ kră boih ưh pă đei kon dơ̆ng.

"would you wait for them till they were grown? Would you restrain yourselves from having husbands? No, my daughters; for it grieves me very much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD has gone out against me!”","na măr iĕm wă kĕ gŏk gô truh bre sư 'lŏ tơ̆l? Măr iĕm wă ưh kơ chă klo nai hloi hă?

"Then they lifted up their voices and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.","Na lu sư nhơ̆m dơ̆ng, đơ̆ng noh Orpa chŭm tơnei sư na tơklah; mă-lei Rut sư kiơ̆ tơnei sư Naômi."
"And she said, “Look, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law.”","Naômi khan dơ̆ng kơ Rut thoi âu: Ih lăng bĕ, oh ih sư brŏk tơ pơlei păng yang sư kơdih, ih brŏk thoi mŏ ih bĕ."
"But Ruth said: “Entreat me not to leave you, Or to turn back from following after you; For wherever you go, I will go; And wherever you lodge, I will lodge; Your people shall be my people, And your God, my God.","Mă-lei Rut tơl sư thoi âu: Ih 'nĕ pă athei inh tơklah đơ̆ng ih, yua kơ ih năm tơ yơ inh gô kiơ̆ ih tơ noh; ih oei tơ yơ inh gô oei hơdai ih tơ noh; kon pơlei ih kư̆m jing kon pơlei inh mơ̆n; Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei ih kư̆m jing Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei inh mơ̆n"
"Where you die, I will die, And there will I be buried. The LORD do so to me, and more also, If anything but death parts you and me.”","ih lôch tơ yơ, inh kư̆m wă lôch păng 'bŭ hơdai ih tơ noh. Mă khan tơdrong kiơ pha 'nguaih kơ tơdrong lôch wă plah inh đơ̆ng ih. Apinh Kră Yang ăn tơdrong gleh truh tơ inh."
"When she saw that she was determined to go with her, she stopped speaking to her.","'Bơ̆t Naômi kơtơ̆ng păng băt kơ sư wă kiơ̆, na sư ưh pă athei dơ̆ng."
"Now the two of them went until they came to Bethlehem. And it happened, when they had come to Bethlehem, that all the city was excited because of them; and the women said, “Is this Naomi?”","Thoi noh na bre sư năm hơdai truh tơ pơlei Betlehem. Kơplah bre sư truh tơ pơlei Betlehem đĭ-đăng bơngai lăm pơlei 'bôh 'brơ̆k mơnat, lu drŏ-kăn tơpinh băl, noh hăm trŏ kơ Naômi ưh?"
"But she said to them, “Do not call me Naomi; call me Mara, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.","Na sư tơl lu sư khan. 'Nĕ pă krao inh anăn Naômia dơ̆ng krao inh anăn Marab yua kơ Tơ'ngla Mơsêh Mơyang ăn kơ inh đei tơdrong chhŭr nuih."
"I went out full, and the LORD has brought me home again empty. Why do you call me Naomi, since the LORD has testified against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?”","Inh weh đơ̆ng âu sơ̆ inh đei tơm tơdrong, mă-lei inh brŏk âu brŏk tơpang ti hoh. Kră Yang tuh ăn kơ inh tơdrong gleh glăn păng Tơ'ngla mơsêh mơyang pơm kơ inh pơmat-tat."
"So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess her daughter-in-law with her, who returned from the country of Moab. Now they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest.","Naômi hăm Rut, bơngai Môap, mŏ mai sư yak hơdai sư. Bre sư đơ̆ng char Môap, truh tơ pơlei Betlehem kơplah bơyan wă jê̆ kĕch 'ba."
"There was a relative of Naomi’s husband, a man of great wealth, of the family of Elimelech. His name was Boaz.","Naômi đei minh 'nu kơtum gah klo sư, anăn sư 'Bôô, sư bơngai đe pơyom păng mơdrŏng dêh lăm adrĕch Êlimêlek."
"So Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, “Please let me go to the field, and glean heads of grain after him in whose sight I may find favor.” And she said to her, “Go, my daughter.”","Rut bơngai drŏ-kăn Môap khan kơ Naômi thoi âu: Apinh ih ăn kơ inh năm tơ mir wă kơ inh chă mok 'ba kiơ̆ đơ̆ng rŏng bu mă đei jơhngơ̆m mơnat kơ inh, na inh chă mok măi 'ba. Naômi drơ̆ng sư: Ơ mŏ, năm bĕ."
"Then she left, and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers. And she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.","Thoi noh na Rut năm mok druh kiơ̆ đơ̆ng rŏng đe yuă 'ba lăm minh hlak mir ei. Sư chă mok noh trŏ kơ mir 'Bôô, kơtum Êlimêlek."
"Now behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, “The LORD be with you!” And they answered him, “The LORD bless you!”","'Bôô lĕch đơ̆ng pơlei Betlehem năm truh tơ mir sư khan kơ lu bơngai yuă 'ba thoi âu: Hơpơi kơ Kră Yang oei hơdai iĕm! Lu sư tơl khan. Hơpơi kơ Kră Yang ăn tơdrong pŭn hiôk kơ ih!"
"Then Boaz said to his servant who was in charge of the reapers, “Whose young woman is this?”","Đơ̆ng noh 'Bôô apinh bơngai wei-lăng yuă 'ba thoi âu: Bu bơngai âu?"
"So the servant who was in charge of the reapers answered and said, “It is the young Moabite woman who came back with Naomi from the country of Moab.","Bơngai mă yuă 'ba tơl sư khan: Bơngai adruh noh sư bơngai Môap, mă wih kiơ̆ Naômi tơ âu."
"And she said, ‘Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.’ So she came and has continued from morning until now, though she rested a little in the house.”","Sư khan kơ nhôn thoi âu: Inh apinh iĕm ăn kơ inh chă mok 'ba đơ̆ng rŏng kơ iĕm yuă dônh dăi lu hơie 'ba sơlam hơchô̆ lu iĕm dan.

"Then Boaz said to Ruth, “You will listen, my daughter, will you not? Do not go to glean in another field, nor go from here, but stay close by my young women.","'Bôô khan kơ Rut thoi âu, ơ mŏ adruh, mơ̆ng bĕ, ih 'nĕ kơ chă mok tơ mir đe nai hŏ! Păng kư̆m 'nĕ kơ weh đơ̆ng mir âu. Năm oei hơdai hăm lu adruh jang kơ inh."
"Let your eyes be on the field which they reap, and go after them. Have I not commanded the young men not to touch you? And when you are thirsty, go to the vessels and drink from what the young men have drawn.”","Lăng bĕ lu sư yuă tơ mir ayơ na ih kiơ̆ đơ̆ng rŏng lu sư tơ noh.

"So she fell on her face, bowed down to the ground, and said to him, “Why have I found favor in your eyes, that you should take notice of me, since I am a foreigner?”","Rut kŭp kơ̆l drap bon 'bơ̆t anăp sư, khan. Yua kơ kiơ inh mah đei tơdrong mơnat 'bơ̆t anăp ih, dĭng ih mah lăng inh, mă khan inh bơngai tơmoi ră?"
"And Boaz answered and said to her, “It has been fully reported to me, all that you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you have left your father and your mother and the land of your birth, and have come to a people whom you did not know before.","'Bôô tơl thoi âu: Inh đei kơtơ̆ng đe roi dôm tơdrong ih đei pơm 'lơ̆ng kơ mĕ klo ih đơ̆ng rŏng kơ klo ih lôch păng yua kơ kiơ ih đei achăng lê̆ mĕ 'bă ih, dêh char ih rơneh, mă năm oei tơ anih mă ih ưh kơ băt adrol."
"The LORD repay your work, and a full reward be given you by the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings you have come for refuge.”","Hơpơi kơ Kră Yang 'mong ăn kơ ih dôm tơdrong 'lơ̆ng ih đei pơm, ih gô năm kơ'nơp ala pơnăr Kră Yang 'Bok Kei-Dei đe Isơrael."
"Then she said, “Let me find favor in your sight, my lord; for you have comforted me, and have spoken kindly to your maidservant, though I am not like one of your maidservants.”","Rut tơl thoi âu: Ơ yŏng tơ'ngla inh, ih đei jơhngơ̆m mơnat kơ inh păng pơlung inh, ih pơm 'lơ̆ng kơ inh đam ih, mă khan inh ưh kơ trŏ kơ lu đam drŏ-kăn ih."
"Now Boaz said to her at mealtime, “Come here, and eat of the bread, and dip your piece of bread in the vinegar.” So she sat beside the reapers, and he passed parched grain to her; and she ate and was satisfied, and kept some back.","Kơplah jơ sŏng sa 'Bôô khan dơ̆ng kơ sư: Hiăng hơ-oei mă jê̆ tơ âu, iŏk sa 'bĕng âu păng chơ̆m tơ lăm sik iŭ bĕ, na sư năm hơ-oei jê̆ lu bơngai drŏ-kăn yua 'ba, lu đe noh ăn por hơdrĕng. Sư sa dĭng phĭ, kư̆m oei rơkah sư 'măn lê̆."
"And when she rose up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, “Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not reproach her.","Đơ̆ng noh sư iung năm chă mok dơ̆ng 'Bôô pơma hơtă kơ bơngai tơdăm jang kơ sư.

"Also let grain from the bundles fall purposely for her; leave it that she may glean, and do not rebuke her.”","Hroch iŏk bĕ minh 'bar hơie pră lê̆ wă kơ sư dônh păng 'nĕ kơ chrih kơ sư!"
"So she gleaned in the field until evening, and beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.","Thoi noh sư chă mok lăm mir noh truh tơ kơsơ̆ măng; na sư pơjuă 'ba sư mok noh đei đăi dang minh êpha 'ba tơ'bâu."
"Then she took it up and went into the city, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. So she brought out and gave to her what she had kept back after she had been satisfied.","Sư pŭ brŏk tơ pơlei. Sư tơ'bôh ăn kơ tơnei sư 'ba mă đơ̆ng sư chă mok, klaih kơ noh Rut iŏk ăn kơ tơnei sư 'ba mă đơ̆ng sư chă mok, klaih kơ noh Rut iŏk ăn kơ tơnei sư por đêl sư sŏng rơkah."
"And her mother-in-law said to her, “Where have you gleaned today? And where did you work? Blessed be the one who took notice of you.” So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said, “The man’s name with whom I worked today is Boaz.”","Tơnei drŏ-kăn sư khan: Năr âu ih chă mok 'ba tơ yơ?

"Then Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “Blessed be he of the LORD, who has not forsaken His kindness to the living and the dead!” And Naomi said to her, “This man is a relation of ours, one of our close relatives.”","Naômi tơl mŏ mai sư thoi âu: Apinh Kră Yang ăn pŭn hiôk kơ sư, yua kơ Kră Yang ưh kơ lê̆ ôh pơm 'lơ̆ng kơ lu bơngai lôch păng lu bơngai oei arih.

"Ruth the Moabitess said, “He also said to me, ‘You shall stay close by my young men until they have finished all my harvest.’ ”","Rut bơngai drŏ-kăn Môap khan: 'Bok noh sư khan kơ inh, oei hơdai hloi hăm lu đam drŏ-kăn inh dĭng đĭ bơyan yuă 'ba inh!"
"And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, “It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his young women, and that people do not meet you in any other field.”","Naômi khan kơ Rut mŏ mai sư thoi âu: Ơ mŏ adruh 'lơ̆ng dêh ih năm kiơ̆ hơdai đam drŏ-kăn sư, ih 'nĕ pă chă năm tơ mir đe nai dơ̆ng, hli kơ đe pơm kơnê̆ kơ ih!"
"So she stayed close by the young women of Boaz, to glean until the end of barley harvest and wheat harvest; and she dwelt with her mother-in-law.","Thoi noh sư kiơ̆ hơdai hăm lu đam drŏ-kăn jang kơ 'Bôô, chă mok dĭng truh hlôi kơ bơyan yuă 'ba tơ'bâu păng 'ba mi đĭ.

"Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, “My daughter, shall I not seek security for you, that it may be well with you?","Naômi mă tơnei Rut khan kơ Rut: Ơ mŏ, inh wă athei chă kơ ih anih hnam, wă kơ ih chơt hiôk."
"Now Boaz, whose young women you were with, is he not our relative? In fact, he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor.","Ih băt boih 'Bôô, yua kơ ih đei kiơ̆ hơdai boih lu đam sư 'Bôô noh kơtum bơ̆n 'mơ̆i, măng âu kơnh sư păng lu jang kơ sư wă năm um pơliĕng 'ba tơ anih preh 'ba."
"Therefore wash yourself and anoint yourself, put on your best garment and go down to the threshing floor; but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.","Thoi noh ih năm 'nhao hơrao hơpĕch bĕ, pik đak pơgang 'bâu phu păng hrŭk hơbĕn ao mă 'lơ̆ng, na jur năm tơ anih preh 'ba sư kơplah sư sŏng sa tam mă đang ih 'nĕ ăn kơ sư 'bôh ih."
"Then it shall be, when he lies down, that you shall notice the place where he lies; and you shall go in, uncover his feet, and lie down; and he will tell you what you should do.”","Mưh sư wă năm 'bĭch, ih athei lăng tông sư 'bĭch 'bơ̆t yơ, đơ̆ng noh ih năm pơih khan 'bơ̆t jơ̆ng sư, ih 'bĭch hloi 'bơ̆t jơ̆ng sư, sư gô khan kơ ih pơm kiơ kơnh."
"And she said to her, “All that you say to me I will do.”","Rut tơl, inh gô pơm kiơ̆ dôm tơdrong ih đei khan kơ inh."
"So she went down to the threshing floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law instructed her.","Đơ̆ng noh sư jur tơ anih preh 'ba păng pơm kiơ̆ dôm tơdrong tơnei sư pơkă kơ sư."
"And after Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was cheerful, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain; and she came softly, uncovered his feet, and lay down.","Đang kơ sŏng sa boih 'Bôô jơhngơ̆m sư hiôk dêh, sư năm 'bĭch tep tơ cheng pôi 'ba, Rut năm chơlon hơdar hơdar pơih khăn 'bơ̆t jơ̆ng sư na 'bĭch hloi."
"Now it happened at midnight that the man was startled, and turned himself; and there, a woman was lying at his feet.","Tŏk-bŏk măng 'Bôô kơdrăt plơ̆ akâu sư lăng 'bôh minh 'nu drŏ-kăn 'bĭch 'bơ̆t jơ̆ng sư!"
"And he said, “Who are you?” So she answered, “I am Ruth, your maidservant. Take your maidservant under your wing, for you are a close relative.”","Sư apinh, bu hah? Inh Rut, đam drŏ-kăn ih, apinh ih tơsu ăn kơ inh khăn, yua kơ ih kơtum jê̆, ih trŏ kơ huai iŏk inh."
"Then he said, “Blessed are you of the LORD, my daughter! For you have shown more kindness at the end than at the beginning, in that you did not go after young men, whether poor or rich.","'Bôô khan, ơ mŏ adruh apinh Kră Yang ăn kơ ih tơdrong pŭn hiôk!

"And now, my daughter, do not fear. I will do for you all that you request, for all the people of my town know that you are a virtuous woman.","Ih 'nĕ kơ hli, inh gô pơm ăn kơ ih dôm tơdrong ih apinh yua kơ đĭ-đăng kon pơlei băt kơ ih drŏ-kăn iơ̆m dim gơh găt."
"Now it is true that I am a close relative; however, there is a relative closer than I.","Trŏ boih inh jing kơtum jê̆, mă-lei đei minh 'nu kơtum jê̆ hloh kơ inh."
"Stay this night, and in the morning it shall be that if he will perform the duty of a close relative for you—good; let him do it. But if he does not want to perform the duty for you, then I will perform the duty for you, as the LORD lives! Lie down until morning.”","'Bĭch bĕ măng âu tơ âu, pơgê dơning inh gô năm apinh tơdah bơngai noh sư wă huai iŏk ih, sư athei huai iŏk bĕ, mă-lei tơdah bơngai noh ưh kơ lăp đon wă huai iŏk ih, lei inh gô pơkă 'bơ̆t anăp Kră Yang mă arih ling-lang tơpă inh gô huai iŏk ih!

"So she lay at his feet until morning, and she arose before one could recognize another. Then he said, “Do not let it be known that the woman came to the threshing floor.”","Thoi noh Rut tep 'bơ̆t jơ̆ng sư ei dĭng truh pơgê, 'Bôô khan: 'Nĕ ăn kơ bu băt minh 'nu drŏ-kăn năm tơ anih preh 'ba âu, na Rut iung đơ̆ng hrôih oei măng kuă ăn đe băt."
"Also he said, “Bring the shawl that is on you and hold it.” And when she held it, he measured six ephahs of barley, and laid it on her. Then she went into the city.","'Bôô khan dơ̆ng: Ba ao ih oei hrŭk noh bơyar bĕ na chĕp mă kơjăp na sư bơyar hloi ao.

"When she came to her mother-in-law, she said, “Is that you, my daughter?” Then she told her all that the man had done for her.","Kơplah Rut brŏk truh tơ hnam tơnei sư, tơnei sư apinh, ih năm hăm đei tơdrong truh kơ ih thoi yơ mŏ? Rut roi kơ tơnei sư dôm tơdrong mă 'Bôô đei tơgŭm sư khan."
"And she said, “These six ephahs of barley he gave me; for he said to me, ‘Do not go empty-handed to your mother-in-law.’ ”","Sư đei tŏng ăn kơ inh tơdrâu hnŏng 'ba tơ'bâu âu păng pơkă khan ih ưh kơ gơh brŏk tơ tơnei ih tơpang ti hoh đĕch ôh."

"Now Boaz went up to the gate and sat down there; and behold, the close relative of whom Boaz had spoken came by. So Boaz said, “Come aside, friend, sit down here.” So he came aside and sat down.","'Bôô năm tŏk tơ 'măng jang pơlei păng hơ-oei tơ noh.

"And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, “Sit down here.” So they sat down.","'Bôô pơtơm mơjĭt 'nu lu đe kră lăm pơlei na sư khan: Ngôi 'bơ̆t dâu bĕ, na lu kră hơ-oei hloi."
"Then he said to the close relative, “Naomi, who has come back from the country of Moab, sold the piece of land which belonged to our brother Elimelech.","'Bôô khan hloi kơ bơngai mă gơh huai iŏk Rut thoi âu: Naômi, bơngai mă 'nao brŏk đơ̆ng char Môap, sư roi khan wă tĕch teh 'nhŏng lu bơ̆n Êlimêlek."
"And I thought to inform you, saying, ‘Buy it back in the presence of the inhabitants and the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it; but if you will not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know; for there is no one but you to redeem it, and I am next after you.’ ” And he said, “I will redeem it.”","Na inh roi tơbăt kơ ih, apinh ih răt iŏk bĕ teh noh, 'bơ̆t anăp lu đe ngôi tơ âu păng 'bơ̆t anăp lu kră pơlei inh.

"Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you must also buy it from Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to perpetuate the name of the dead through his inheritance.”","'Bôô khan dơ̆ng: Mưh năr ih răt iŏk mir đơ̆ng Naômi, lei ih athei iŏk hloi Rut bơngai Môap, klo sư lôch wă pơtrơp ioi wei iŏk mŭk tơmam bơngai lôch noh."
"And the close relative said, “I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I ruin my own inheritance. You redeem my right of redemption for yourself, for I cannot redeem it.”","Bơngai mă gơh huai iŏk tơl sư: Mưh lei inh ưh kơ gơh huai iŏk ôh, kơnh hli kơ tơmam inh hiong. Iŏk bĕ kơ ih tơmam mŭk mă trŏ kơ inh huai iŏk ră, yua kơ inh ưh kơ đei huai iŏk?"
"Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning redeeming and exchanging, to confirm anything: one man took off his sandal and gave it to the other, and this was a confirmation in Israel.","'Nâu tơdrong juăt kră sơ̆ bơngai Isơrael wă kơ huai iŏk dah tơplih băl: Wă pơsĭt tơdrong ei, bơngai âu plôh chơkhŏ sư ăn kơ bơngai noh; âu jing tơdrong wă pơsĭt nơ̆r pơkăm lu bơngai Isơrael."
"Therefore the close relative said to Boaz, “Buy it for yourself.” So he took off his sandal.","Thoi noh bơngai mă trŏ kơ huai iŏk khan kơ 'Bôô: Iŏk bĕ kơ ih, đơ̆ng noh sư plôh chơkhŏ sư ăn kơ 'Bôô."
"And Boaz said to the elders and all the people, “You are witnesses this day that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s, and all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s, from the hand of Naomi.","Đơ̆ng noh 'Bôô khan kơ lu kră păng đĭ-đăng kon pơlei thoi âu: Năr âu 'bơ̆t tơm măt lu iĕm inh răt iŏk boih đơ̆ng Naômi dôm mŭk tơmam Êlimêlek păng đĭ-đăng tơmam đơ̆ng Kiliôn păng Mahlơn."
"Moreover, Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon, I have acquired as my wife, to perpetuate the name of the dead through his inheritance, that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brethren and from his position at the gate. You are witnesses this day.”","Păng Rut adruh bơngai Môap inh iŏk pơm akăn wă pơtrơp anăn bơngai lôch păng mŭk tơmam, wă kơ anăn bơngai lôch huay kơ hiong ôh đơ̆ng lu 'nhŏng oh sư păng đơ̆ng kon pơlei pơla sư; năr âu lu iĕm pơsĭt kơ tơdrong âu."
"And all the people who were at the gate, and the elders, said, “We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman who is coming to your house like Rachel and Leah, the two who built the house of Israel; and may you prosper in Ephrathah and be famous in Bethlehem.","Đĭ-đăng lu kon pơlei păng lu kră 'bơ̆t 'măng jang ei wang tơl thoi âu: Đĭ-đăng lu nhôn pơsĭt tơdrong noh. Hơpơi kơ Kră Yang ăn bơngai drŏ-kăn mơ̆t oei lăm hnam ih nhen thoi bre Rachel păng Lêa, bre sư pơjing boih adrĕch Isơrael. Ăn kơ ih arih jang sa rai tŏk lăm char Êphratha păng anăn ih đei ư-ang lăm Betlehem."
"May your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, because of the offspring which the LORD will give you from this young woman.”","Hơpơi kơ Kră Yang ăn kơ ih đei kon sâu đơ̆ng bơngai adruh âu, thoi adrĕch Phêrês kon Tamar hăm Juđa."
"So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife; and when he went in to her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bore a son.","Thoi noh 'Bôô iŏk Rut pơm akăn, bre sư oei hơdai, Kră Yang ăn kơ Rut anăp na tơpŭ kơ minh 'nu kon drŏ-nglo."
"Then the women said to Naomi, “Blessed be the LORD, who has not left you this day without a close relative; and may his name be famous in Israel!","Lu drŏ-kăn khan kơ Naômi trŏ bơnê kơ Kră Yang, Sư ưh kơ đei lê̆ ih ôh; ăn hloi kơ ih đei bơngai trŏ kơ huai iŏk; hơpơi anăn kon hơ'lơ̆p noh đei ư-ang lăm dêh char Isơrael."
"And may he be to you a restorer of life and a nourisher of your old age; for your daughter-in-law, who loves you, who is better to you than seven sons, has borne him.”","Sư gô jing minh 'nu bơngai pơlung tơiung ih, sư gô wei rong ih lăm năr ih kră, yua kơ sư kon mŏ mai ih bơngai 'mêm kơeng kơ ih, Rut mŏ mai ih gĭt hloh kơ tơpơh 'nu kon drŏ-nglo."
"Then Naomi took the child and laid him on her bosom, and became a nurse to him.","Thoi noh Naômi pơk kon hơ'lơ̆p 'bơ̆t kơtơh sư păng wei rong."
"Also the neighbor women gave him a name, saying, “There is a son born to Naomi.” And they called his name Obed. He is the father of Jesse, the father of David.","Lu bơngai drŏ-kăn rông 'bôt lu sư anăn ăn kơ bơngai hơ'lơ̆p drŏ-nglo âu Ôbêt, na khan: Đe tơpŭ boih minh 'nu hơ'lơ̆p drŏ-nglo ăn kơ Naômi, Ôbêt sư jing 'bă kơ Jese, 'bok tơm Đawit."
"Now this is the genealogy of Perez: Perez begot Hezron","'Nâu adrĕch adrung Phêrês: Phêrês pơjing Hêsrôn."
"Hezron begot Ram, and Ram begot Amminadab","Hêsrôn pơjing Aram; Aram pơjing Manadap"
"Amminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot Salmon","Manadap pơjing kơ Nasôn, Nasôn pơjing Samôn"
"Salmon begot Boaz, and Boaz begot Obed","Samôn pơjing kơ 'Bôô, 'Bôô pơjing Ôbêt"
"Obed begot Jesse, and Jesse begot David.","Ôbêt pơjing Jese, Jese pơjing kơ Đawit."
